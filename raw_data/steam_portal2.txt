Tabajara	Recommended	60.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tabajara77/	Portal 2 is one of the best puzzle games made by Valve, an amazing sequel to the classic puzzle game Portal 1, with an outstanding storytelling including perfect levels and memorable characters, that shows how sequels should be made!

Cyclops Inc.	Recommended	40.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CyclopsInc/	On Steam, the signs of a once in a generation game are as follows:-It has been out for years but tons of people still play it-The reviews are Overwhelmingly Positive-Any negative reviews are just 5 year olds whining or people saying "WHY ARE YOU LOOKING FOR NEGATIVE REVIEWS JUST BUY IT"-Even if you've beaten it, you keep playing anyway-Your friends have it and love it (and if they don't love  it, why are you friends)There's more, but those are all certain signs, and Portal 2 checks each box with a mark the size of Aperture's entire facility.This is a truly unique and special game which just about anyone can enjoy. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone.
Priit	Recommended	32.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/prtvrk/	The game that has stood the test of times, still great..
Saibot	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S41B0T/	Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece. The voice acting is some of the best that I've ever heard, the puzzles are just hard enough, the game runs beautifully. It is just enjoyable if you look at the single player. If you've considered buying this game and haven't yet, do it! The only bad part about this game is that, now that I'm finished with it, I can never experience it for the first time again.Next Target - Co-Op Campaign
Kuebic	Recommended	31.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kuebic/	What's to say?  Creating a sequel to a classic is no simple task.  But somehow, Valve did it.  They improved Portal every conceiveable way.If you liked Portal 1, you'll LOVE Portal 2.
TheRealCelticBatman	Recommended	95.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/celticbatman/	This game is now 4 years old and a sequel to a game even older.  Yet the quality and unique game dynamic endure.  Mods are still being made for it (get Portal Stories: MEL as soon as you finish this game!!), and it just endures as a classic.  I will play this game in 10 years and it will still be fun.Buy the orange box, on sale, and get hours and hours of fun 9.7 / 10
TeddyStyle	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tehteddystyle/	Honestly I'm still baffled and I'm clueless how to start this review. I'm still clueless how they set the bar for their prequel this high and even provided with a better sequel. I can't wait to jump into the co-op function honestly since the singleplayer was this good.Valve literally took a look at Portal and said what could we improve towards the sequel. They added new general features like a loading screen, which I didn't find mandatory, and you can see where your portals are placed through walls. They stuck with similar ideas to complete their puzzles and added loads of new ways to solve puzzles and move along the map. Speaking of puzzles, they added so many, that it seems that the game is twice as long as the prequel. They added lasers and with them you have cubes which you can use to direct the lasers in any way you want.  You have bouncing pads and on walls you see indicators which show where you land. You have bridges to guide you around the map. You also have floating pads which can work in two directions but only when triggered by a button. Finally you have three kinds of gel red blue and white. Red gel gives you a speed boost. Blue gel gives you a jumping boost and white gel allows you to portal on it, mainly for places that you couldn't portal on before.Obviously the things previously said aren't the ones that baffled me but it is mainly the environment. The story is amazingly well built and it teaches us more about apeture sciences. It also contains a few plot twists here and there. The places you visit are fairly new but you'll visit some well remembered places from portal. Something they also introduced is companions, the most part of the game you'll have a object travelling with you. One of them is a funny little core with a british accent. Aside from entertaining you the bots can help you sometimes to get to certain paths. The jokes are as good as last game so expect a good laugh.I highly recommend  that you buy this game, and play it for the rest of the day or week. Turn off your notification, because the game doesn't support tabbing, and enjoy this gem for many and many times you want and are supposed to complete the story. (Edit:) You also can choose from many maps from the community to test out so you won't get tired of the story and you can still play.

chinほ	Recommended	5.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chinoman1129/	One of the most brilliant games ever made. The gameplay, humor, characters, and wittiness are astonishing. The co-op was some of the most fun I ever had. Do yourself a favor and get this AND the first Portal if you haven't already.
Adam	Recommended	48.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NagatoAdam/	Portal was sort of a little experiment of a huge company. That’s why success of the first part of the Portal was a surprise even for the VALVe. Therefore seriously question arose about the Portal 2. And what we got? Let's see.　STILL ALIVE?　　The game begins with the fact that Chell along with her new partner, personality module Wheatley, is trying to escape from an abandoned Aperture Science laboratory. Throughout the game, the plot makes a interesting twists. Individual deserves compliments perfect finale, after which there remain only a warm feeling. In Portal 2 no epic stories, huge explosions, incredible action, or the salvation of humanity. Instead, there is a charismatic characters, intelligent humor and interesting puzzles.　ONE IS GOOD, BUT TWO IS BETTER　　One of the achievements of the new Portal has been the emergence of the cooperative. Co-op story is a continuation of the plot of the single player. At first I thought that the only difference of the cooperative is the presence of two players with portal-guns, instead of one. In fact, the cooperative has unique ideas. Many puzzles solving quite differently. I advise you not to play cooperative with a random person (there is that possibility), and play it with a good friend.　ENDLESS TESTS　　In game was added a level editor, so anyone can create their own test chambers or try to play the levels of other players. To be honest, most of the player-created levels are too simple or ridiculous. But there is sufficient interesting maps (and some of them really hard). In no case do not miss the community maps.　Multiplayer:　　Online: Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ Θ 　　Co-op:    ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Storyline:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Graphics:   ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺O　Gameplay: ☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺☺　　Complexity of the achievements: All achievements can be easily earned (if you have good friend for the co-op) in the one-two walkthrough.　　　　VALVe made another good　　game. With good intelligent humor,　　charismatic characters and unusual　　interesting gameplay.　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　As expected, nine out of ten [9/10]. 
Reizla	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Reizla/	I've bought this game a month ago and I started playing it last week and I'm SAD......sad that I didn't start to play it immediately when I bought it...sad that I didn't buy it earlier - A LOT EARLIER Portal is one of the best physics based puzzler games I've played. Not only are the puzzles challenging, but the game itself has been made a lot of fun as well with those 2 robotic personalities.
Reinhardt	Recommended	24.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2021560/	Ah, how I remember having first played this with a friend, and then my boyfriend. He and I did the Coop together, prior to doing the single-player mode. Bothwas definitely a blast!Portal 2 has all the ingredients to being a great physics puzzle game, along with the interesting story in the solo-mode. For Coop, you play as Atlas or P-body who must solve all the puzzles presented in each stage, as instructed by GLaDOS. I will not go into too much detail of who GLaDOS is, but this feminine voiced AI is not exactly the brightest guide, with good intentions. She has made sinister comments towards the players, or individually as a way to cut down trust and teamwork, despite the entire point of Coop mode being working together. I’ve heard GLaDOS mention things like me performing better than my partner, and vice-versa as well as hints of betrayal. All of which I find hilarious. Both Coop and Solo mode has these factors, which keeps the entire game very interactive and thrilling, despite Portal 2 being a puzzle game. My boyfriend and I enjoyed our times of thinking, testing and trying tricks and tactics to get the level cleared.In solo mode, we continue off from it’s prequel, playing as the main character Chell, who mistakenly stars up GLaDOS while in the Aperture science laboratory. GLaDOS is, of course, the antagonist at least for the first half. We’re guided by Wheatley, another AI residing in Aperture Science for some period of time until GLaDOS is taken down. Regardless of which mode you play, there is also some fourth wall breaking too, where the player is challenged to act against what they are instructed to do. Plot twists and dark truths about the Aperture Science laboratory are implied/hinted within certain stages if you look hard enough.The graphics and audio are what you’d expect from Portal, if not better. The soundtrack had songs like “Want you gone” and the “Turret Opera” song from the end of the game, which were stuck in my head after completing the solo mode. No complaints here!My only negative experience for the game is that I was incapable of playing it for prolonging hours due to motion sickness. Portal 2 will have your screen spinning, flipping and some flashing graphics here and there, so make sure you have the settings set right before letting nausea ruin the experience lol.Steam achievements, a workshop for custom levels, and a scoreboard exists for if you want to play competitively in each stage/level. I love this game, and hope that for some miracle Valve will make a sequel (Wishful thinking on my part). Portal 2 is a must-play if you haven’t done so already!

dangerhighdoltage	Recommended	39.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/urnbont/	"Daddy, I want a portal gun".  My 6 year old tells me one afternoon.  "Um, sure, okay" I say.  The idea never enters my mind that he is talking about a video game.  A few days later, I notice something while he is playing Scribblenauts.  Right there in his inventory of scribbly things is a portal gun.  THE PORTAL GUN. "OHHHH!" I say.  Now it hits me.  Where on earth did he see that?  I must be a terrible parent.  Okay.  "Daddy can play for you" , I say with a gleam in my eye.  We proceed to install Portal 1. Right when I start the game, he grabs the keyboard and takes over.  Before I know it, he's blazing right through the levels.  Then, he says, "Let's play Portal 2!""Portal 2?""YES! I want to play Portal 2!"   Well.  I actually do own Portal 2, so fair enough.  It's been on my backlog for too long.  We proceed to install Portal 2.  And on to the beginning...it's as if we are transported to a movie.  He's a little scared.  I ask him if he wants to stop it's okay - it may be too scary.  He squirms around, but as soon as the puzzles start he is ALL OVER IT.  Wow, this little guy really knows how to play.  Physics in a hole - WHATEVER - a 6 year old is blazing through this.  He gets stuck on level 15.  I GET STUCK ON LEVEL 15 TOO.  This puzzle is wrecking my brain, but then I realize I simply did not notice something.  Solved and on to the next.  The both of us play through the game off and on for a few months, he turns 7, and we put in a good chunk of puzzle solving together along with a fair amount of co-op play.  I even bought a controller adapter for a PS controller so we could play side by side.  A week ago we both finished it ( on the really scary parts I let him leave the room ).  I can't remember the last time I had so much fun completing a game with a partner.  My own little guy.  Thanks Valve for making a great game that is a also a wonderful father-son game to play together.  He proudly wears an Aperture Laboratories t-shirt now. 
flækkefar	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/terrazh/	One of the best games in my library? Certainly.One of the best games available on Steam? Most definitely.This game requires you to think out-of-the-box, and will have you solving puzzles constantly.The dark humour in this game is hilarious aswell, and that only adds to the great experience.The singleplayer is great, but solving puzzles with a friend is possibly even greater, and allows for much more complex contraptions. Even after you finish the story, you can download heaps of custom-made community maps, which allows for tons of extra hours. I highly recommend it ;)

EpicManeuver	Recommended	23.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheJesseCox/	Portal 2 is a mind boggling, hilarious adventure and a great sequel to one of the best games ever made. Co-Op is roughly 5 hours long and single player is only a few hours longer. Don't expect weeks of play from this one, BUT with that said it's still a must buy.
Tetriot	Recommended	424.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054774821/	I'm not a gamer - not really. Only occasionally will I find a game that captures my imagination and pulls me into its world. The Curse of Monkey Island was the first to do that, then the first Pokemon games on Gameboy. After that I enjoyed a few titles, sure, but I spent far more time obsessing over cinema or books.Portal 2 pulls you in like a brilliant book or film. It is crafted with superb empathy for the player's experience, regardless of gaming ability. The story, acting, music and world-building are impeccable. It's at turns eerie, funny, tense and poignant. Every element of the experience is designed artfully and executed with a fluid efficiency that would make GLaDOS proud.  I couldn't recommend it enough.
Daikunshuu 😂	Recommended	579.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DontWasteEnergy/	You must be living in a potato if you haven't even heard of Portal,,Portal 2 is the latest installment of the Portal series, it is a first person Puzzle platformer with a very nice Single Player Story and also a fun cooperative modeWould highly recommend playing this with a friend
Thordred	Recommended	49.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thordred/	Portal 2 takes elements of adventure, puzzle, platform and first-person action games and blends them into a unique genre mix. It builds on the foundation of its acclaimed predecessor, takes all the gameplay elements that made it great and vastly improves them in every aspect. With that said, I strongly recommend to play Portal first. If you don't you will still play through the sequel without any confusion, Portals plot was minimal (even though exceptionally well-written) and the basic puzzle design is picked up in Portal 2. But you would miss out on a great game and why would you want to do that?Once again you take over Chell, Portals female protagonist, who finds herself rudely awakened from a cryogenic sleep and imprisoned in a small chamber inside the Aperture Science testing facility, an environment vaguely familiar from Portal - vaguely because a lot seems to have changed since your first time around. Some of the structures at the beginning of the game are indeed places you have already seen during your first escape but this time they are clearly aged, in a state of decay, overgrown with plants and seemingly abandoned. But soon you will have to make your way through unknown terrain and new test chambers that turn out to be anything but abandoned. Fans of Portal will be pleased to learn that GLaDOS makes its reappearance. Something else is different right from the start: You are now accompanied by a british-accented robot named Wheatley, who insists that an escape can only be accomplished together.Portal 2 really shines in the writing department, the story is much more developed compared to the first installment. Many unanswered questions are revealed, such as bits and pieces of Aperture Sciences history and the origin of GLaDOS personality. Where GLaDOS was Portals only speaking character you now get to hear your goofy sidekick Wheatley and, through pre-recorded messages, Aperture Science founder Cave Johnson. All voice actors did an outstanding job and manage to really bring all three speaking characters to life.If you played first-person shooters before you will be instantly familiar with the controls, mouse for camera movement, WASD to move, space to jump and left & right mouse buttons to shoot your portal gun. All game mechanics from Portal like pressure buttons, disintegration fields and of course the eponymous blue and orange portals, that are surprisingly simple in theory but make for surprisingly diverse and challenging puzzles, made it into the sequel and in addition many more are added: different sorts of gel that let you jump higher or run faster, catapults, light bridges, air tubes and lasers. Each element of its own already makes for complex puzzles but once the game starts to combine several of them you're in for a real challenge.Compared to its predecessor, the game provides a lot more content. Not only is the single player campaign about twice as long, it even adds an extensive second co-op campaign. Two players open a lot more puzzle opportunities and the devs managed to use them to their fullest. But don't worry, you are given various means of communication. It's recommended to simply plugin your headset and make use of Steams voice chat feature but even if you don't you can still highlight spots by simply pressing a key, start countdowns to synchronize your actions, open a small screen that lets you look through the eyes of your co-op partner and perform small gestures to communicate non-verbally. Or you could just utilize the ingame chat to write.But it doesn't end here. Thanks to user generated content the replayability is almost unlimited. When you mastered both campaigns, just tap into the huge library of player generated chambers, even whole campaigns are available to download, and keep playing with ever new challenges.When you compare the visuals to Portal you cannot help but appreciate the excellent graphic design. While Portals test chambers looked bland and lifeless, they're now impoved with many small details. You have moving, transforming environments, plants growing through cracks in the walls and especially the vast, subterranean areas later in the game are a stunning sight.Long story short: Portal 2 takes the premise of its predecessor and takes it to a whole new level. A game for the books.

What really shines here though is the fantastic voice acting from the antagonists, Wheatley is hilarious with his british accent and GLaDOS just being cynical and awesome as always!It has a lot more challenges as well and the multiplayer works perfectly.

Klooger	Recommended	4,417.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/klooger/	Don't have much experience in this game, but what little time I did spend playing was great fun. One of my top 5 games of all time easily 11/10
VEL0CIRAPT0R	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122488806/	Take everything you love about Portal, then times it by five. This game has so many good aspects to it, it's hard to know where to start.Sound? Witty dialouge, excellent voice work, a really cool soundtrack, and even something as simple as the sounds that the portal gun makes sound awesome!Gameplay? Addictive.Story? Really good. There are some parts to the story where I genuinely felt threatened and isolated. Graphics? Nothing to complain about.Although Portal 2 is undoubtedly one of the best games I've played in a while, there are two errors that I find with it:#1 There are parts in the game where you have to use the "zoom" key to find almost unfindable portable surfaces. I thought this gameplay mechanic was rather silly and annoying.#2 There are parts in the game where the events that happen don't make much sense, and you wonder why you have to do certain things or why you're in certain places.Overall this game is one of the best games of our generation, and it's loads of fun. It's good aspects overwhelmingly outweighs my tiny nit-picked errors.
C.Tendies	Recommended	15.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/garretta706/	DAMN this game is good. I think at this point everyone knows what the Portal series is, so I'll just point out some of the highlights.The story is great with interesting characters and a perfect pace. The plot twists are well done and it only tells you what you need to know. The story is also supplemented by the great humor.Of course it's a puzzle game, so the puzzles and level design need to be good. Luckily, they're done flawlessly. On top of that the environments are also amazing and add lots to the world.Once you're done with the story mode there's a level creator that is perfectly made and allows you to do just about anything you want. People have used this to make some crazy and amazing levels. The community, while I'm not sure how active it is now, has always been very helpful and creative. You'll never run out of content as long as talented map creators exist.Definitely a must play for anyone. It's only $20 and worth every penny.
-   .julez.a	Recommended	41.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thejoolz/	An improvement upon the original in every way. An engaging and well-wrtten story that will probably catch you off guard and make you laugh out loud a few times, new ways to solve puzzles, and some sneaky secret areas make this game unforgettable. If the original Portal was a 10/10, this one breaks the scale.

Don Dask	Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/esaluzdeluna/	Portal 2 is the second and last official installment of the Portal Series, released in 2011 by Valve.In my opinion, this game adds a lot to the original formula and improves a lot of aspects of the first game, this time you'll have to breakout of a destroyed Aperture Science using your skills and your beloved portal gun. You'll also have to master 3 gels, the repulsion gel, the propulsion gel and the conversion gel.The Story, along with the characters are pretty well written and they feel alive. The humor is well done and the dialogues, specially in the later scenarios are totally hilarious. Even you haven't played the first game, you'll undestand the story.The aesthetics are beautiful and you'll have a lot of this so called screenshot opportunities, even if you have a low end rig, you'll be amazed of the beauty that can spawn from the source engine.And the last but not less important aspect of the game, the soundtrack, from the first time you awake from your long time sleep to the last song, Is not only fitting, but also, like grabbing science and adapting it into an mp3 format. You guys did a great work with it.Overall, I recommend it to every time of gamer and non gamer, if you want to get into gaming, try this game. If you love fps, try the game, if you love puzzles, definitively try this game, and the first one , if you're a Valve fan, why are you reading this review in the first place? Get the damn game!

Antwog	Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/	Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle game developed and published by Valve and released in April 2011. Portal 2 incorporates a campaign that allows you to solve challenging puzzles while treating you to a strong and simple storyline. This review will discuss the campaign, the voice acting, dialogue, and the co-op feature.Portal 2 features a quality campaign that emphasises creativity through overcoming puzzles and excels in superb voice acting that includes funny humour. You begin the campaign as Chell, a female character holding a portal gun. Chell completes tests using her portal gun while being monitored by AI computer system Glados, voiced by Ellen McLain. Chell completes these tests while listening to Wheatley, a programming core that is voiced by Stephen Merchant, in which he wants to escape the facility. The puzzles are diverse and I do not grasp the notion they are repetitive. They do in fact become more difficult as the game progresses which is due to new things being added to each level that add a new layer of complexity. For instance, some levels feature turrets that can spray bullets at you, which you must destroy before advancing. Portal 2 has a really good ending that ends the story with an amazing final mission that mixes both emotion and intensity. Furthermore, the ending smoothly transitions into the credits that completely alter the atmosphere into a beautiful light hearted finale, complete with a song sung by Glados. Briefly, the single player experience does have some annoying glitches with freezing when pressing R for the feedback prompt and frequent crashing via alt tabbing. These two issues had minimal impact on my experience of the game.The dialogue enhances the single player component by incorporating witty humour with dialogue that provides excellent characterisation to the characters. For instance, events showcase characters change of heart and provide some emotion to their robot personalities. This creates a juxtaposition of humans and robots because the game reveals human traits of emotion, self-interest for personal gain, and relationships with other individuals within Glados and Wheatley, both whom are robots. The voice acting in Portal 2 complement the strong dialogue because individually, Stephen Merchant delivers a memorable and excellent performance for Wheatley by striking different voice tones that match different situations within the game. Meanwhile, Ellen McLain provides a good voice line to showcase the personality and character of Glados. The dialogue and voice acting immediately created a sense of whose a protagonist and antagonist in the simple story of hero vs. villain.The co-op element of Portal 2 provides more levels to lengthen the game. These levels add some exciting fresh dynamics to each level because you have to cooperate with your team mate and depend on the other to complete levels. For instance, I had to stand on a button while my friend flew to the other side of the window to retrieve the block in order to complete the level.  Conclusion  Portal 2 is a good and challenging puzzle game that emphasises creativity and excels in the simplicity of telling a story. The story nicely builds to an excellent climax that feels like a satisfying conclusion to the game. The game features beautiful voice acting and some exceptional performances from Merchant and McLain and strongly delivers in the quality of the dialogue. I am new to the puzzle genre so playing Portal 2 felt fresh and different. There are some issues outlined above in the game, but nothing that detracts from the overall experience. At $19.99, I recommend it. Rating: 8.5/10  Pros  - The simple story that ends with an excellent climax.- Excellent voice acting.- Very good dialogue. - The challenging and increasingly complex puzzles.- Length.  Cons  - Annoying glitches with the R feedback prompt in single player and frequent crashes via alt tabbing. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

❤ The Lust of Ass ❤	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Envy_Me_1_Forever_Till_Death/	Portal is back and better than ever! The tests are as mind bending as ever, and they've added new elements, like light bridges and emancipation gates. The graphics are smooth and attractive, but nothing that's going to make your jaw drop. The controls are as simple and effective as the first game. But then, none of that was what worried me. I had no doubt that they would be able to recreate and expand upon the technical aspects of the first game. My concern was whether or not they would manage to capture and continue the personality and sense of humor of the first game. I am very pleased to report that the sequel does not disappoint. The sequel pics up right where the first game left off, and GLaDOS holds a grudge. Her insults, passive aggressive comments, and general malice will have you chuckling throughout the game. Your new companion and guide robot also adds to the character of the game, though he can be a bit heavy handed at times. If you enjoyed the first game, you will love the sequel, both for its expanded challenges, and its unique personality. As long as you enjoy a good puzzle and have a sense of humor, you will never regret this purchase.

'b	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ready2b/	Portal 2 is even better than PortalPortal 2 is another game on my "must play" list. Portal was already incredible, yet somehow Valve managed to make the sequel exquisite. Positive:- Fluid, responsive controls.- Amazing puzzles, both for single player and co-op.- Great difficulty curve.- This time there is actually a story. We finally get to learn more about Aperture Science.- Wheatley joins the party. In combination with GLaDOS, their unique personalities and humour just make Portal 2 incredible. Basically fantastic script and voice-acting.- This is not just a remake of Portal. This time gels are added to put a unique touch on puzzles. Basically an upgrade in gameplay and difficulty.- Co-op mode! Like single-player, the co-op mode is brilliantly designed, and addictively fun. - Community-made maps (basically endless fun and challenges).- Companion cube still loves you <3Negative:- Still no cake.- You require a competent buddy for co-op.Conclusion:Valve really outdid themselves this time. There really isn't much else to say. The praise I gave in my Portal review is just as valid here, although it must be said that Portal 2 deserves even more praise.  You would be a fool not to play Portal and Portal 2.If you enjoyed this review please follow me on my curator page and group. Your time and support is greatly appreciated!

Rae	Recommended	42.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/raegeeks/	Wheatley says he has to drop from the rails several feet above me. He's nervous about it. I promised I'll catch him.... I lied. I watch as he thunks and rolls on the ground. He asks me to pick him up. I refuse. I watch as he entices, begs and cajoles me to pick him up. Several minutes later I do. Then he asks me to plug him into the wall. I decide to dance around the room with him instead. The cycle of begging and wheedling begins again. After several minutes he gives up and falls silent. I plug him into the wall. 10/10 Would torture Wheatley again.
Ov3RT4K3R	Recommended	38.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/	Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10If you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guideshttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curationAlso feel free to check out my YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC83DYCmrWfl9ttrhX54jmWA 
Nilesy	Recommended	39.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redglaring/	Portal 2 is the phenomenal sequal to Valve's award-winning Portal. Many were dubious about Portal 2, prior to the release, due to how amazing Portal was, feeling that nothing could live up to it, unless the game were truly amazing. Valve managed to pull that off by miles.Portal 2 is hugely fun, with a remarkable and hilarious storyline which blends so perfectly from the first game it's almost seamless, with Stephen Merchant bringing an extra layer of awesome as the memorable character, "Wheatley". On top of the great story, you have the map maker, which provides hours and hours of enjoyment on top of the original packaged challenges. Get it.Nilesy
Prayson	Recommended	37.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dheerajmenonk/	Who would've ever thought that a puzzle solving game could've been made this amazing by providing it with amazing  visuals, storyline, dialogues and multiplayer mode?Valve is the developer of both csgo and portal 2. One game makes you cancerous while the other makes you smarter.

Murphy's Lawyer	Recommended	35.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/murphyslawyer87/	AT A GLANCE(Full review follows below) Game Name: Portal 2 Original Release: 2011 Genre Tags: Innovative; Puzzle; Sci-Fi; Action; Funny My Overall Grade: A+ Estimated Playtime (Campaign): 3-6 hours Multiplayer Aspect: Optional and Auxiliary Recommended To: Established fans of the genre; Those intrigued by the genre; Novelty seekers; Casual gamers; Multiplayer gamers  REVIEWPortal 2 takes everything that was done right in the first game and injects it with steroids. It boasts a longer, more diverse campaign that still manages to hold on to the humor, atmosphere, and overall quality that made the original so enjoyable. It also boasts a new cooperative mode, which brings the experience to a new level. And to top it off, with Steam Workshop integration, the possibilities for new content become limitless.In the campaign, all of the strengths from the first game return and are fine-tuned to perfection. The puzzles are more diverse and interesting, with more advanced mechanics introduced. The atmosphere is even more fleshed out and enticing. The dialogue is even more hilarious and entertaining. And to top it all off, the game is about twice as long.After that, there is also an incredibly well designed cooperative mode, complete with its own characters and puzzles. This adds what is effectively another whole game to the mix, which is a very welcome addition.And to top it all off, with the Steam Workshop integration, there is endless possibilities for new puzzle rooms in both single-player and cooperative modes. Not all of it is great, of course, but some of it is arguably better than the real game.  It is a gift that just keeps on giving.With the gameplay being so intuitive and enjoyable, and the limitless possibilities of the Workshop, Portal 2 rockets to the clouds as a deity among video games.  It is hands-down one of the absolute best games in existence.  If you haven’t yet tried it, now is the time.  There are hours of entertainment waiting for you.

Durty Gambino	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DurtyGambino/	Amazing game even better than the first.  It's practicly given away at this point so no reason for anyone that has Steam to not have this game.
Schmoes	Recommended	15.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/	It goes without saying this is exceptionally one of the greatest first-person shooter games that doesn't require real bullets, competitive teamwork, accurate aiming, targets and most other common mechanics that are found in that specific genre to make such a fantastic and charming game. This title demonstrates what it always had shown in the prequel; perfect gameplay and immersive story-telling. Thus, this sequel opens the gateway to the remarkable Portal series.Now, imagine all of those unanswered questions and obscure mysteries that linger within the first game, and how this sequel answers nearly all those said questions with the utmost scientific explanations through the lines of entertainment from this one. From what I could honestly tell you, this game took the first games mechanics, and widened the story much more bigger and exceptionally better. Portal 2 is by far, worthy of the 'Game of the Year 2011' awards.

FlappyJackie	Recommended	11.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FlappyJackie/	Because I'm a Potato.....Valve's Portal 2 is the award-winning sequel to the hit game, Portal. I do recommend that you play the first one in order to fully understand the whole story and for you to be familiar with the concept of Portals ^_^You play as Chell, a mute girl that just does what she does :/ I seriously don't know what's going on in her head xD anyways, you wake up in a room years and years after the events of Portal and the adventure starts there.... Let the testing begin >:) Story is well-driven and easy to follow. Although the game features more/less 5 characters (including Cave Johnson and Caroline). They're so lively and have their own iconic personalities, Wheatley is awesome :D You'll never get bored of the dark humor continuously thrown at you xD I have to say that the story is a bit short compared to their flagship game, Half-Life.The Source engine is by far my favorite. I'm playing this game at a consistent 100fps set to High/Very High.... no crashes in-game, and absolutely looks delightful (especially the lighting). It can also run very well on older systems, which is always a plus for me ^_^ Music is what you'd expect from Valve....... just pure awesomeness, nuff said xD Gameplay is the same as the first game. It's not a generic shoot-everything-that-moves FPS but a puzzle-solving FPS that involves Portals and require you to have a keen observation on your surroundings and lots of thinking. I honestly was stuck on a puzzle for a good 20-mins. until I went "Ohhhhh, now I get it" and proceed to finish the test chamber xD It stands out because of its one-of-a-kind gameplay and does it extremely well ;)Overall Experience: I have yet to try out the co-op mode, but the single-player campaign left me wanting more. That feeling you get after solving a test chamber is quite awesome ^_^ and doing it again, but faster, feels even more rewarding. Although I have problems launching the game (It just might be my Steam client) the game itself runs incredibly smooth. I give this game two-thumbs up ;)
BlackHawk1159	Recommended	48.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackHawk1159/	Portal 2 is a great game. It did everything perfectly: action, length, humor, and Wheatley. Everybody should buy it. Now i am going to go wait for Portal 3
¡Juannabe!	Recommended	17.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dooblearyun/	A simply ingenious puzzle game. I can't even imagine how much time it took for the creators to make this game. Portal 2 is a unique puzzle game where the player must follow a stupidly humorous robot to escape the lab that they are stuck in. Overall, the game was complex and intriguing, with many laughs along the way. This game is very frustrating, so if you don't enjoy getting stuck while playing a game then this game is probably not for you. Otherwise, Portal 2 is a fun game that is interesting to all types of gamers. There is a co-op  gamemode, but it's only available for local gameplay (don't quote me). There is also a steam workshop for this game so you can play community made maps.Portal 2 is not really worth $20, because the story mode gives you around 10 hours of gameplay. However, the game regularly goes on sale. Buy it at its cheapest price ($3.99).Definitely a must buy for all clever gamers 10/10  Portal 3 confirmed  
Skyferret	Recommended	4,316.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyferret/	Would definitely recommend this game. You have to remember though, it's a thinking game. You might be well acclimated FPS games, but it's always a welcome change. It's grown over the years with add-ons and mods making it even better.
Vanom	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SHOOTER57/	Portal 2 is a First Person Perspective mash of puzzle game and First Person Shooter made abd published by Valve. It is a sequel to acclaimed by critics Portal from 2007. Until now the game was released so far on PC with Windows, Linux and OS X, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360. Maybe it is just my imagination but I think being a real gamer and not hearing at peast once about this franchise is nearly impossible.The plot continoues story of Chell, our mute protagonist after events of the first Portal is still imprisoned in Aperture's facility, this time however she has a new companion, the AI named Wheatley. During they desperate struggle to escape they accidentaly revive GLaDOS, the AI overseeing the entire project. Once again the villainous machine force us to solve puzzles and proceed through test chambers in order to survive. The story is preety great in my opinion, thanks to side characters that can be funny yet convincing all the time really make you enjoy everything, also it has some shocking plot twists and really satisfying ending.Just as in previous game Chell is armed with the iconic Portal Gun that can create portals on white surfaces, allowing us to move around on very creative ways. Developers also cared to add some new mechanics including pushing streams and various gels boosting our speed or height of jumps. Turrets, buttons etc. The level design often force us to think over all the movements, the solutions are not always obvious so you can spend even an hour in one chamber just on trying out what works and what not.Soundtrack is not only enjoyable, but also it reacts to what player does. If you walk on orange gel for example the music speeds up for a while, it really adds some immerse to the gameplay.The game has it's years so at least on modern PCs you can expect flawless performance, frames does not fall ever below 60 on highest settings, besides graphics still look great.To be honest this is propably the one of the most intense puzzle games you can find on Steam today, story does not dissapoint, gameplay require a lot of thinking, the music fits great and it is all still enjoyable despite the years. If like me you have grown on classic Tomb Raiders or other games that challenge your way of thinking you will enjoy it so much. 10/10.
Nattie	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nattiedk/	Amazing game. The game is hilariously fun even though it must be considered as a puzzle game, but the conversations throughout the game as you progress through are simply amazing. You kind of get a feeling that you just need to continue to the next chapter to get the whole story told while you progress. You will eventually figure that robots actually have humour after this experience...(I would say it's worth the price, if you ever wanted to find out how it is to be a test subject, that is) I could keep typing but I have more testing to do in order to get out of here...

UnKn0wN	Recommended	25.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/UnKn0wNL33t/	This game is just.. so beautiful. Everything is done so perfect, the characters, the storyline, the soundtrack, the gameplay, and everything else you could think about. Portal 2 also includes co-op mode, where you can play the game with an friend and experience it again together! Certain puzzles were more difficult than Portal 1 in my opinion, but that's the point of these puzzle games anyway to keep you thinking to solve them! Since it's a Source Engine game, this game will most likely run on your potato too!I had such a hella amazing time playing this finally after 7 years, despite me being a long-time Valve fan and playing Portal 1 during the times when Orange Box was released in 2007. I really really regret I haven't had the chance to playthrough the entire game for so long. I really want everyone to play and experience this superb masterpiece game, if someone still hasn't played it, like me a while ago!Definitely 10/10 without any doubts whatsoever!And..... SPAAAAACEEEE!

jgfghfhgf	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hjgmfhgfcg/	Portal 2 is the follow on to the extremely successful first person original. The game retains all of the game play elements from Portal 1 and adds lots of new features such as bridges made from light beams, and splashing paint gel which accelerate your speed or make you jump higher. In the single player campaign, you play as Chell. As with the original Portal, your character can take a small amount of damage before they die, thankfully like the original you don't take fall damage still.  The aim of the story mode is to explorer the Aperture Science Lab, which is filled of complex puzzles that have a clear exit point, but there are also other parts of the game which are not so clear leaving the objects less clear.The tutorial at the start of the game explains all of the game play elements very well and gets you well prepared for the on coming puzzles; and whenever there is a new element introduced, the game does a very good job of making you aware what it does without shoving a tutorial screen in your face every time.Portal 2 is powered by the Source engine, like all of Valve's more recent releases (Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead, TF2), and it looks stunning. You will find it hard nowadays to find a game that looks as well polished as Portal 2, all of the colours, textures and visual effects are done perfectly. Story-wise is the feature in Portal 1 that I thought it fell down on, however in Portal 2 they knocked it out of the park. It follows on from the story line set in the original and goes beyond the level of detail and complexity that you would expect. I needed to find out how it ended once I started playing, and the ending is just beautifully crafted. The difficulty is like most puzzle games, if you are good at them, it will just come naturally. It definitely has a better difficulty curve when compared to the original, but even still at times I had to revert to a walkthrough to pass through some puzzles (shame on me eh?) but there is nothing here that can't be solved if you sit and think for a couple of minutes each time.The single player story mode took me about seven hours to complete, this to me is a perfect length for a game of this type, the game ends at a high point and I was 100% satisfied with the outcome. There is also a co-op campaign included which will also add a good number of hours. On top of both of these, we also have Steam Workshop support, meaning endless hours of mods and different chambers to try and master. I have yet to try any out yet but some of the maps and rooms I have seen on the workshop page just look amazing. I wouldn't be surprised to see people being able to get fifty plus hours in this game. In conclusion, Portal 2 is a must play for any gamer out there. It is an absolute classic that should certainly be in your library. It goes on Sale every few months so most people will already have it, but you need to play it. If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Nessa	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NessaFoxie/	This game was well worth the wait and This game is highly addictive, and there's plenty of new content to satisfy any Portal fan.There's always many alternative ways for game makers to go with the story, and quite a few are not what we expect. Portal 2, while keeping the "oh my god I did not expect that!" factor, did a perfect job in taking both the game and the story to a whole new level in the Valve universe (talking about Half-Life & Portal since they're both in the same era)Overall: It's amazing and refreshing to see, and play, all the new and fresh ideas Valve has come up with this sequel.If you are a Portal fan, You should already have bought this game. If you have played Portal but are not deep into it like many people are, you should still Play this game.what a ride, from start to finish, Valve took the high road and only made one cake reference.10/10, Valve. Good job,

Pierce	Recommended	25.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/piemanpierce/	 Pros:- Cheap- Much better story in comparison to Portal 1- Amazing Co-op- Funny- Game breaking bugs aren't common or don't exist at all (Bugs have never affected my game in any way)- Pretty easy to get the hang of the basics- Puzzles can be quite challenging and actually make you thinkCons:- Intro music is a tiny bit too loud whenever you open the game lmaoReview:Portal 2 is my absolute favourite puzzle game of all time and is my favourite co-op game of all time as well. I still haven't completed the single player story but I still wanted to write this review because of how much I'm enjoying it so far and how much I enjoyed playing the co-op. It feels extremely satisfying whenever you finally figure out a part without looking it up online that you've been stuck on for ages. There never was a part during the co-op that I started feeling bored. The co-op does a great job of making it so that both people need to be doing something instead of just one person doing everything on their own. For the single player you should finish Portal 1 before you start playing otherwise some of the story will confuse you. I struggled to find any cons for this game. It goes without saying, you need to get this classic and don't forget about the co-op.Rating:10/10

Kazini	Recommended	15.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kazini/	I will always love this game.
Unholy Gypsy	Recommended	93.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/UnholyButNotThatHoly/	Everything. Everything about this game. It's just a solid 9-10 out of 10. There's not really any denying that. The story is so interesting and chilling, the co-op is so fun when you figure the puzzles out together, and speaking of puzzles, there's so damn many you can create and is what makes this game special most of all, and the gameplay, the characters, the creativity, you just  need  to have and play this game in your life. And not only that. The first game, too. It's a masterpiece. Both of them are. That's what makes it even better. Trust me, it's definitely worth every buck.
Portlux	Recommended	31.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/portlux/	Amazing concept and art. even though you have finished the game's story mode, the cooperative mode is still fun. The ending is just one of my favorite ending. Made me cry. Awesome Game would recommend 11/10.
BELLA	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mh102646/	It should have been impossible to top the near-perfect Portal in comedy, storytelling, and physics-bending first-person puzzles, but Portal 2 somehow manages it! 
KitKat	Recommended	38.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aryfuntime/	Some of the best Valve has to offer! Pros: - It's all of the good things about the original cranked up a notch- Puzzles with difficulty that are satisfying as all hell to complete- The same dark humor charm that the first game has, but it wears it proudly now!- Gorgeous for the Source engine- Underrated industrial soundtrack! Cons: - ... I don't have anything Overall: 9.2/10 Portal 2 is Portal on drugs. Good drugs. Not like methamphetamine. More like, a nice acid trip.That's a horrible analogy. It's a fantastic game, and I highly recommend it!

JD Herrera	Recommended	19.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089052394/	Portal 2* 10/10Sequels often suck. NOT THIS TIME!!!!Portal 2, as a direct sequel, doesn' change much in the base formula, so the game is still based on a more polished version of the Source Engine, is still a First Person Puzzle game but adds a lot of innovations and elements that grant this sequel the status of "Epic".After the end of the first Portal we're once again in the Aperture Science Labs, but we're in a different section of the facility and the first thing that can be noticed is that the structures decay and some vocal messages hint that an indefinite but consistent amount of years have passed, and thanks to a Personality Core named Wheatley we try to escape the falling facility. Unfortunately We'll have to pass through the remains of GLaDos, causing her awakening and forcing us to become again Her Guinea Pig. You think this is a spoiler? FOOLS! From here the game will show it's improvement as there actually is a HUGE story plot, with plot twists and revelations that will amaze you room by room making you eager to finish the game to see the end and forgetting I've ever revealed you that (predictable) detail.The innovations won't stop with just a (GREAT) plot, but the gameplay is incredibly improved as well. You won't have to deal with just portal related riddles, but you will face gels and funnels, where blue gel will make you bounce high, orange will accelerate your walking speed, white will allow you to spawn portal on every tainted surface and funnels are transport streams that will make you float in their direction the moment you cross them. You can't even imagine the combinations of all these elements, no to mention the events in the story.Level design is improved far beyond the first chapter's standards. There will always be minimalistic design test chambers, but we'll have to walk beyond interspaces, factories, dismantled rooms, and immense areas that will make you wonder how big is this Aperture Science supposed to be. You will end up digging so much that you will end up in one of the very first sections of Aperture Science realized at the time of its founder Cave Johnson.And here comes another aspect of Portal 2. They went so far with the game that hired English (obviously) Writer and actor Stephen Merchant to voice Wheatley and American (obviously) Actor J.K. Simmons to Voice the 'Murican Cave Johnson... And their accent and characterization is definitely great.Soundtrack is a greatly appreciated news this time because even though it is subtle and thin during most of the gameplay it has some dynamics so you'll hear little flashes of melody when you're solving parts of puzzles, but most importantly there are more studied melodies especially during scenes or scripts.The last improvement is the other section of the game... Because portal 2 has a single player campaign... AND a Cooperative campaign. We can invite a friend to play via internet and solve 6 sets of chambers precisely studied for cooperative gameplay.+++PROs+++ STORY.  Unbelievable, but portal 2 has a great story showing you the origins of the Aperture Science Labs, GLADos and more, and it somehow has little links to Half-Life 2 as well! Great Final, totally love it. CHARACTERS.  This time there are more characters, besides GLADos. All her sarcasm always makes me laugh as well as Wheatley's stupidity, and Cave Johnson's 'murican attitude. GAMEPLAY.  In Portal you use portals. In portal 2 you have Gels, Funnels and the hallucinating combination of these 3. COOP CAMPAIGN.  Great Coop campaign, perfect game to play with a friend. SOUNDTRACK.  Seriously this game has a very nice electronic soundtrack, this was unexpected.---CONs--- LENGTH.  This time the Single player campaign lasts significantly more compared to Portal and the Cooperative campaign is quite consistent as well, but I still believe they could have lasted a bit more... MOAR!! SEQUEL.  I've completely lost hope for a third chapter for Both Portal And Half-Life...I played this game on this machine:Intel Core i7-497016Gb RAM DDR3GeForce GTX 660Windows 10 Professional x64 You can follow my reviews through my curator page: Everybody's reviewsYou can also join my Steam group: Everybody's reviewsYou  are welcome to join and post your own reviews, we can support each other!

Big D McGee	Recommended	46.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/b1gdmcg33/	In my opinion, Portal 2 is the greatest game that Valve has ever released.Pros:+Solid Storyline+Well optimized+Great gameplay+Campaign is much longer than the first game.+Wheatley+You can create/publish your own levels using either Hammer, or the in-game level editor.+Co-op multiplayer+it goes on sale for dirt cheapCons:-Several of the custom levels are garbage. (There's still plenty of good/great ones though)-The in-game level editor controls like♥♥♥♥♥ and takes some getting used to.  It's especially frustrating when you're making a complicated map.Conclusion:I strongly recommend getting it, and I'm not even a fan of puzzle games.
morcydoodle	Recommended	109.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/06231991/	I only tried CO-OP, and i finished it in no time, this has got to be one of the best games with co-op using Atlas and P-Body as the main characters in co op with using the iconic orange and blue colors on them.
BlackHawk	Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051971343/	Amazing game. I can't belive it was sitting idle in my library for like 3 years. Finally I completed it last night in around 6-7 hours run (single player). I need to try co-op now ^_^PROS:-Very simple mechanics with incredibly smart level and puzzle design-Probably the best use of humor in any game I've played-Well written script and top notch voice acting-Puzzles are set just right, not too hard to stale the progress, not too easy to fail to provide a challenge-POTATO CORE TRANSFER(!)-Last boss fight and EndingCONS:-Maybe a little on the short side-It had to endFinal Verdict 9/10
It was me, Dino!	Recommended	40.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dino_Nadine/	If someone told me that I would fall in love with a game in which I get called fat and stupid by an AI potato whilst simultaneously having to solve puzzles in order to escape my death, I'd  probably have thought they were more than a little bit deranged. However, the Portal series is exactly that; two fantastic games that got me hooked pretty quickly. I put off playing them for a while and I wish I had gotten to them sooner as they really are games that I think anyone will enjoy. With villains you can't really ever hate, GlaDOS' fantastic running commentary, suprisingly addictive puzzles, a pretty good sountrack  and cake, I honestly see why Portal has such a big fanbase and I recommend this game to anyone and everyone who hasn't already played it.

Sumire	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cenicla/	Portal was amazing but portal 2... a masterpiece.
[APG]RoboCop[CL]	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SCO_RoboCop/	This game is priceless, not only it has more problem solving test chambers, a longer storyline and more maps, but it contains some good Human Relations humour from the British Bot, Wheatley. You can also play as Co-op with your friends and solve more portal problem solving.If you are keen on Science or a Sci-Fi fan then this is the game for you. The solving ideas aren't that hard as the key parts are for looking at flat white surfaces, as portals only work in there, working out the gravity, pitch and yaw when jumping from portal to portal. The clues aren't that cryptic for trying to work your way to journey on in the game. But this game also comes with new features like light bridges, suction rays, replusion gels and many more.Well what are you waiting for? Buy this awesome game!
ǂvǿļçåņǿquåķȩǂ	Recommended	19.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014146141/	Yes this is one of the best games ever made. Better than halflife series and better than the original Portal. Everything came together just right in Portal 2. The voice acting, graphics, puzzles, puzzle designs, scripts, co-op, story, voice cast.  Also GlaDOS is one fine nemesis.Just wish Valve would get off it's lazy a.ss. and fund Portal 3.

BlobbyCHEZhead	Recommended	26.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlobbyCHEZhead/	Very Impressive. Because this message is pre-recorded, any comments we may make about your success are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments. – GLaDOSThere is so much to be impressed about in Portal 2. From the amazingly developed and memorable characters to the brilliantly balanced puzzles, Portal 2 may well be the best puzzle game ever created.I purchased Portal 2 about 11 months after it was released. I didn’t even know who Valve was back then, I didn’t know what Source was and I didn’t have a clue about anything to do with the Portal story, but after playing it, Valve quickly became my favourite game developers. Back then, I was only interested in 2 things. Gameplay, and graphics. We had only recently upgraded to an Xbox 360 from a very old, original PlayStation, so the games I’d bought for the Xbox were, as you can imagine, amazing, but Portal 2 had better graphics than any other game I’d been playing. I was also interested in the gameplay, and Portal 2 nailed it with its hilarious characters and difficult puzzles. As I grew up and played the game over and over again, I noticed things I hadn’t noticed before, like secret rooms and signs on the walls, which got me into researching the story. Trust me, the story is deep… but, this review is spoiler free, so I’d encourage you to do it yourself!Portal 2 is a brilliant combination of puzzles, well developed characters, and an RPG element, which makes the game amazing, and better than any other puzzle game I’ve played before. To start off with, you wake up in a strange room, and you meet a funny little “ball” robot named Wheatly. He guides you over to the old testing tracks, but on your way to escape the facility, he accidently turns on the main core robot, who controls everything, GLaDOS! She “forgives” you (play the oringinal portal) and instead of killing you, she spares your life and instead makes you test, as she indicates “for the rest of your life”. I’m not going to say any more, because it would be a shame to spoil it for anyone, but I highly recommend you play this game. This is one of the few games I would say to buy at full price if you have enough, because it’s totally worth it. There is also a co-op campaign that has a completely different story, it's great to play with a friend. Thanks for reading!

Pointnclickster	Recommended	33.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pointnclickster/	This game was absolutely fantastic! It really blows the first game away in terms of looks and story. The game is much much longer and you really get to see behind-the-scenes of the Aperture Science Facility and its backstory, which is really interesting. The banter of Wheatley and the frenemy vibe between Chell and GLADoS is amazing and hilarious. I did not have any of the motion sickness problems that I had in Portal.  Also, you get to put a portal ON THE MOON. Epic, just epic. Why are you reading reviews for this? Just buy it. You may be the last one to.
JC	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019727990/	What an incredible game!! In summary:  Probably the most original game I have played, and one I regularly return to due to its brilliance and depth of story.Having completed the single player side of this game, I've come away feeling a review is the only way to say 'well done' to the development team for creating such a fun and different experience.  I never understood why professional reviews talked about a 'good storyline' in a game when my own experience in them was nothing but unnecessary dreary babbling nonsense failing to pull me into the world that the developers were trying to create... that is, until now!I found myself intrigued by the storyline and although predictable at times I found myself look forward to the next chapter, particularly towards the end.  All of it from the gameplay to the storyline, the humour and the voice acting is extremely well done.If you are looking for something different or simply a very good puzzle game then consider this.

ilsvaf	Recommended	1.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067688454/	Portal was a great game, the experience of flying through the portals was very enjoyable. Portal 2 extends that gameplay with new types of puzzles. The humor is just in the right amount to make you laugh but not distract from the experience.
TheKingOfHighPing	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chazzerbazzer/	5 Reasons Why Portal 2 is so good:- Dialogue is entertaining - Easy to get invested in both the characters and story (Wheatley is great)- Very rewarding puzzles that manage to challenge you without frustrating you (depending on how good you are at working through the chambers)- Co-op mode gives more content to enjoy with a friend; overall more entertaining than the single player but lacks story. The co-op mode can be played over and over again with different friends if you are fortunate enough to have more than 1 friend who owns the game lol.- Community Chambers are a great challenge and there is some real replayability value 11/10 GET THE GAME!

Ughh until I do a proper review, WHICH I WILL. I can only say that this is truly a masterpeice, and I have no complain about this game. This is in my opinion the example of a perfect game. I've gifted this game nearly 10 times now.  I've made it my tradition to gift Portal 2 to any friend I introduce to steam to,  and let me tell you know, each one of them ends up being an loving portal fan. Buy this game, no questions.

VooDoo	Recommended	43.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008480668/	Few sequels face as daunting a legacy to live up to as Portal 2. The original stands as one of the cleverest and most revered games ever made and so the pressure is on for the return visit to Aperture Laboratories.As before, you play a human lab rat subjected to the experimental challenges dreamt up by the evil computer GLaDOS. The goal is to exit ever more puzzling rooms with the aid of a Portal Gun that lets you shoot up to two virtual doorways onto walls coated with a special substance. Once you've got two portals in place you can walk through one and come out of the other.Initially the challenges thrown at you are straightforward: zap one portal onto the wall next to you, put the other onto the wall next to the inaccessible exit and then simply walk through the portal. But after a few gentle introductory tests to familiarise you with the concept, Portal 2 starts presenting you with brain-aching challenge after brain-aching challenge.You might need to open an exit by placing a block on a pressure pad, but the block is located on an inaccessible ledge high above you with no obvious route up. To reach it might involve using portals to reach a high walkway before firing a portal into the floor below and the other into the wall opposite the ledge with the block, so that when you jump down into the portal on the floor you are sent flying out of the other portal and onto the ledge with the block.And soon the complexity is cranked up with the addition of other elements to the puzzles such as tractor beams, gels that alter the properties of surfaces and bridges made out of light.Like many puzzle games the description often sounds more intimidating than the reality, but Portal 2's environmental conundrums are truly challenging: requiring lateral thinking and dissolving notions of up, down, left, right, forward and back. But while the challenges can be bewildering, the sense of achievement you get from solving a challenge that had you stumped is immense with confusion melting away into a thrilling Eureka! moment.Portal 2's fiendish puzzles would make a great game on their own, but the game doesn't compromise on setting either, moulding a captivating story out of its puzzling action. The script and voice acting is nothing short of fantastic: the acidic wit of superb*tch GLaDOS balanced by the bumbling Bristolian tones of Stephen Merchant, who plays an equally amusing rival AI.Beyond the single-player mode there's a set of co-operative two-player challenges that can be played in split screen or online. The two-player challenges are even tougher than the single player so the need to discuss with each other how to tackle each puzzle is paramount. While this means it works best when players are in the same room, Valve have done a sterling job of providing players with tools to indicate their ideas to other players so that the online mode works almost as well.The only possible criticism you could level at the game is that once a room is solved, there's little reason to go back. But when a game delivers as many moments of joy and satisfaction as Portal 2, you'll need to be a rather sour soul to make such a charge.Ingenious, engrossing puzzler and a worthy sequel to one of the greatest games ever!
James	Recommended	3,511.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jsweden/	More intriguing story and more diverse game mechanics than the first portal game. It's for sure in the top 10 when it comes to puzzle games. You might have a hard time finding people to play co-op online with, but I would say the price is still justifiable since the single player missions is really fun.

wirefr4me	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wirefr4me/	You know, I only write serious reviews for games I feel that are precious to me, Portal 2, obviously is one of those games. I started this game knowing nothing about the main story from Portal 1, but just playing the game normally perfectly explained it all, everything about this game; exemplary. From the soundtrack, to the puzzles, hell, even the robot characters have colorful personalities. And finishing the game brought a tear to my eye, while saying "Man, what an adventure that was." Definitely one of the most unforgettable games of all time, so do I recommend this? HELL YES.
o	Recommended	51.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ya-boi-wengsley/	This is one of my most favourite games, it has an amazing and in depth storyline. The easter eggs like the borealis one are amazing. The plot twists genuinely aren't expected, unlike most games where you know what will happen around every corner. I'm a huge fan of greek mythology so when I found the oracle turret, my mind was blown! Cave Johnson was definitely a great character to introduce and to help us find out more about Aperture. THE ENDING, I absolutely loved the ending!!

bw-jack	Recommended	44.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bw-jack/	Valve claims Portal 2 is their best game, and I agree with it!The review is gonna be a bit chaotic, here we go.Even having no humans at all (except protagonist) this game seems so alive, crowded and interesting. Huge underground laboratory is like city. Animation of robots is so beautiful and fantastic. Plot has nothing to do with Borealis, but it is even better that way. Level design is stunning, you can be in these rooms for hours watching all details creators put in them. Sounds and music are magnificent as well. The game is full of funny puzzles, but I don't recommend custom ones, they seem too hard :)I liked everything about this game. Disliked only frequent loading screens, finished test chamber for 2 minutes and here is loading again... But loading screens look cool though :)The game is extremely elaborate and qualitative. I highly recommend it for everyone.

Colonel_47	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thewizardtony/	You begin as Chell, the mute female test subject from the first game once again trying to escape the confines of Aperture Science with the help of a charming A.I. named Wheatley. Things only go downhill from there as you dig deeper into the ruins of the old facility; learning of its hidden past while forming an unlikely ally...Experience this amazing game for yourself. The excellent; witty humor, the challenging puzzles, the well-crafted story, the intricate level design, the lovable characters, the tremendous voice acting and the unbelievable creativity shine through in all aspects. The story will last you for several hours, but once you finish it to the end there is so much more to do.  A multitude of community workshop maps to get your hands on as well as the amazing co-op mode featuring the test subjects ATLAS and P-Body make this game a must have. Portal 2 is one of the greatest games of this generation and stands as Valve's remarkable achievement. It improves upon the first game in every way, while standing brilliantly on it's own. Every steam user should have this game in their library. It recieves my highest recommendation.
JexiL	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jexil/	Smart puzzles, great story and some of the most memorable characters in any video-game all wrapped up in an absolutely brilliant presentation. Portal 2 is a charmy, lovely absolute must play.
pazartesi_gorusuruz	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058075753/	I was negatively biased towards this game before I played it. Wasn't even sure about buying. I dunno, the whole portal gun and PORTALS thing seemed weird to me even though I like science fiction.BOY WAS I WRONG. The jokes and voice acting in this game is phenomenal. Just amazing. It's not cheesy (ok it's sometimes cheesy). And different story characters have all their own sense of humour. Those different characters do really have different personalities. And the level design; it's just rad.BTW I never played the first Portal game. One of these days, I'm planning to if I can spare the time. I would never have played it if I hadn't played the sequel. So it's that amazing.What are you doing in this game? It's actually the sequel to the first Portal game like I said. But basically, you are trapped inside a training facility. A training for puzzle solving. The thing is, the facility is offline, and nothing is working. It's derelict. And the show runner is nowhere to be seen. Then you are woken up in the middle of all this, by your only friend. Together you try leaving it while solving puzzles that concern teleportation and portals. Then things happen. And everything turns weird.Like I said, there is a lot more to it than this, but this is all one can reveal without spoiling it. This game would be a solid 10/10 which I wouldn't rate for the 90% of other games in my library.+ There is online CO-OP and a mod for local CO-OP+ Challenge mode+ Download community-made levels+ Hilarious voice acting and jokes+ Seriously intriguing story+ I never thought robots' personalities would be so awesome. oh wait+ Time travel+ Ripping your hair off during puzzles+ Resist temptation for walkthrough videos+ Co op is amazing (laughed a bit too much)+ Single player is amazing+ Teleportation makes sense and no sense at all at the same time+ Nice music+ Nice graphics10/10 would love Glados to the death again
Ginopinoshow	Recommended	32.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ginopinoshow/	If you haven't tried it yet, your life is sad. And boring. And without a meaning. Maybe you want to try to make it better? SO TRY THIS DAMN MASTERPIECE!
Snowlep337	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/derpgun/	This game will teach you geometry  
MrNinjaSquirrel	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/	The original Portal was a success I don't think anyone anticipated. Arguably the best part of The Orange Box, it was a remarkably clever and original puzzle game, with an absurd amount of character. But to everyone's disappointment, it was all over too soon. But we were not forsaken; quite the contrary. With Portal 2, a direct sequel (by which I mean to say you should play the original first, as well as before reading this review which will inevitably spoil it), Valve has not only given us a bigger and better game, but one of the greatest pieces of interactive entertainment ever. I mean no hyperbole when I say Portal 2 is an absolute masterpiece on a grand scale, and a game absolutely everyone should get the chance to play!Fair warning, there is no way to talk about Portal 2 without spoiling everything that occurs in the first game, so keep that in mind if you have yet to play it (by which I have to ask, why the heck not?). Disclaimers out of the way, Portal 2 once again places you inside Aperture Science, an expansive underground scientific research and testing facility with fewer ethics than living test subjects. Which is to say just you, Chell, reimprisoned and put to sleep for who knows how long, only awakened when the entire facility is on the verge absolute destruction. Unlike before however you aren't alone, now joined by a naive little robot named Wheatly. With GLaDOS in pieces, escape seems like a simple objective. That is until someone flips a switch to turn her back on...The original Portal is still one of the best written, and most hilarious games I've played, and yet its sequel is miles ahead of it in every possible way. With only a handful of characters, it's amazing how charming and witty every line is. Hilarious, clever, and maybe even a little touching, I can't think of a game that even comes close to matching how perfectly timed and expertly written every moment of Portal 2 is. It's minimal cast does an amazing job of breathing life into the decrepit facility, and makes the simple aspect of walking from one door to the next and immensely enjoyable activity. And it isn't just the writing that deserves remark, but how Valve has implemented it to seamlessly interact with your actions. Characters respond to what you're doing in such a realistic manner that it's hard to believe they are simply programs setup to do so. With so many games relying on traditional, uninteresting storytelling mechanics, Portal 2 moves the medium forward in ways developers need to take note of.However smartly written the dialog may be, it's in the portal puzzles themselves that Valve's intelligence really shines. Not content to simply reiterate the same mechanic we saw in the first game, new elements such as propulsion gel and laser maneuvering cubes are added regularly and consistently expand on the basic portal mechanic in unexpected and interesting ways. Every time I thought I'd seen all the ways a mechanic could be used, Valve expanded the spectrum and again astounded my expectations with the outwardly simple variances in usage that never would have occurred to me. Even on my second playthrough the puzzles never stopped being incredibly rewarding to solve, and giving me just enough of a challenge to consistently test my intellect in a wholly unique fashion.For how old the Source engine is at this point, you'd never know Portal 2 was built on it based on how it looks. To this day I am utterly astonished at what Valve manages to pull off with the engine, and this is easily its most impressive usage to date. The once sterile Aperture Science is now presented in a gorgeous display of disrepair. Walls crumbly around you, lights flicker and cast dazzlingly shadows, plants grow through into the facility, and it all looks absolutely amazing! Even with it's makeover, Aperture is still an eminently memorable and distinct place to inhabit, and the increased variety in locations does an impressive job of realizing the sheer size of the facility which we've only scratch the surface of.I always forget to mention the soundtrack, not because it isn't a fantastic accompaniment to your journey through Aperture, but because it blends so well with the rest of the game that I almost forget it's there. That's not a slight against it however, it's a complement to how suited it is for the game that I can't separate one from another. It's a brilliant score with so many layers I couldn't begin to pick it apart to describe it to you (but thankfully I don't need to, as even if for some reason you don't play the game the soundtrack is freely downloadable). As for the ending, well let's just say Jonathan Coulton is a genius and leave it at that.And then there is the coop mode; yet another brilliant way Valve has surprised me, turning the solitary campaign into a multiplayer experience that demands cooperation. This is what impresses me the most about the mode; it isn't just two players going through a game designed for one, but an entirely new set of levels purposely designed to force you to work with your partner to complete them. It's amazing what can be accomplished with two sets of portals, and this is fully taken advantage of in what are perhaps the best designed puzzles in the entire game. If you don't have a friend to play with, go make one for this game. It's something you shouldn't miss out on.I can't get over it. I've been impressed by Valve numerous times in the past, love Portal to death, and thought I knew what I was getting with it's successor. But Portal 2 is so much more than that. It's an incredible achievement in everything it attempts, from it's outstanding script to the bewildering puzzles and spectacular presentation. It's the best game Valve has ever made, one of my all time favorites, and without a doubt one of the medium's greatest accomplishments!Now if you'll excuse me, there's testing to do.You can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].

I was worried the new gels and such might make the puzzles less interesting and more annoying, but Valve did a great job balancing new and old mechanics to create the perfect challenges. Plus they've added a hugely entertaining co-op mode. Another part that I never expected to work so well. If you have Steam you need to have this game series.

Ori	Recommended	97.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OriKitsune/	Welcome back to Aperture Science(Now with 10% more potato)TL;DR:While singleplayer is a simple and straightforward sequel to Portal, the second installment has a good replay value of its own as it features a variety of extra content, such as a co-op player campaign, plenty of user-generated puzzles as it allows the player some creative freedom in making their own challenges via the ingame puzzlemaker, and there are at least two available story-driven campaign addons on Steam. Portal 2 carries forth the the core likable elements from the predecessor in a charning, quirky sequel.OverviewPortal 2 is a sci-fi physics FPS-puzzle game taking place in a chronologically-ambiguous position in the Half-Life universe. Following the events unfolded in Portal, the sequel brings the faces old and new to the player between the continuity of the experiment courses. It has an entertaining cooperative mode to enjoy with a friend, and user-generated content from the "Perpetual Testing Initiative" that brings the inner mad scientist of the user to life with the ingame Puzzlemaker.PlotTaking the place of the test subject "Chell" once more, the player accompanies her journey through the now-ruined Aperture Science facilities, meeting an old enemy and new faces along the way while solving the various puzzle challenges through the Enrichment Center's remains. The game also features some exploration of the past of Aperture Science, solving some possible loose ends and letting them know about the past of the lab complex. A dark humor-packed character development is noticeable between the messages left behind, and the new quirky characters introduced into the game.The co-op mode also reveals some details of Aperture through the portal experiment course between the two players.Singleplayer ModeThe singleplayer mode is considerably similar to the first game's mechanics, though with a number of twists. New testing elements and various new puzzle-solving techniques make the player think, move and portal their way through the tests with trial and error, either involving the classic testing elements such as moving platforms, turrets and acid pits, or new elements such as lasers and redirection cubes, crusher plates, catapult plates, among others.Cooperative ModeWithout some cooperation the players won't advance in this mode. (Literally. You really can't even get past the level selection if the players don't cooperate and play in such manner.) More advanced puzzle techniques such as timing and advanced portal placement are introduced with a fair amount of trust being in the hands of the partner player. The incompetence (or mischievousness) of either of the parts might end in hilarious failure results.GraphicsUsing an upgraded Source Engine, the game is able to render great-looking environments at relatively low performance cost. Highly detailed testing environments, from the ruins of Old Aperture to the production lines of the upper facilities, you'll see yourself stopping for a few moments to admire the scenery on the areas with more visible attention to detail.Music and SoundThe soundtrack of Portal 2 and its iconic eeriness, generally accompanied by the 'robotic' sounds inserted into the music tracks make Mike Morasky's work fit perfectly into the game.The sound effects of the game, not unlike the soundtrack, are highly detailed. From the slight noises of the testing elements to the rampaging avalanche brought by things like crusher plates in the game, every sound aspect has a high level of detail.The voice acting is priceless, the character dialogue (or, in most part, monologue) is now fitting to each character's personalities and role. Including names such as J. K. Simmons, Stephen Merchant and Ellen McLain, Portal 2's VA cast is noteworthy in that regard.Content CreationAperture Science's Perpetual Testing Initiative -better known as the Ingame Puzzlemaker- is a tool both simple and intuictive to use. Simple controls and a range of elements available, the player can build test chambers to his heart's content with the tool. You can even export your maps to edit with the Portal 2 SDK, for further detailings like custom assets and elements.ConclusionPortal 2 is worth picking up if you're a fan of puzzle games, sci-fi or some quirky humor. The co-op mode warrants some hours of fun with friends, and the puzzlemaker and user-generated content will assure you some extra replay value.

StrangeFlames	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021726329/	Portal 2 is a truely unique puzzle action game which makes great use of a portal gun that can form two seperate portals which would allow the player to traverse the levels.A great sequel to the original Portal game, Portal 2 is a much longer game which features much more complex puzzles and introduces lovable new characters. The voice acting and dialogue in this game is amazingly entertaining and funny, I found myself chuckling multiple time during the game due to the character dialogues! The level design in this game is also great as there were some levels which left me stumped for quite awhile and it took me quite alot of brain power to solve them and that gave me a great feeling after doing so!This game features a co-operative mode which allows players to play with people in your friend list or complete strangers through match-making. There are some form of customization options such as hats in the co-operative mode that can be unlocked through completing the game. There was supposed to be more customization options available in a shop but it has since been discontinued. Trading is also unavailable which is pretty unfortunate as it would be great for players to exchange or sell cosmetics.There is also a level creation tool in this game which allow players to create their own Portal 2 levels and share it online with others by uploading it to the workshop! Several interesting extra content includes a portal 2 comic which serves as a prequel to the game and a super 8 (a pretty old movie by now) interactive game demo.Overall, Portal 2 is a very entertaining game with great puzzles, characters and voice acting. I would give it a 9/10! A must buy if you enjoy action puzzle games!
Wicked Gamer & Collector	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WckedGamerCollector/	Portal 2 is a really good comibnation of FPS / Puzzle Game.Second part of a really nice series of puzzle games.And yes the Portal gun is back again only with a lot of new challanges to beat.It's not a basic and boring puzzle game when you go to stage one until you clear the game.Portal manage to add a really nice story mode to it so the game is fun big adventure to play.Only between stages things happen that makes it challaging and fun to play this game and let you keep on playing.I cleared the game / story mode around the 9 hours so it's not a really big game.What makes it fun you can now play with your buddy co-op to do all the extra missions that complete the main sotry mode.Portal 2 is a really good game and you need to try if you love this genre.I give this game a 9/10.
glitchping.exe	Recommended	46.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/glitchping/	If the first Portal was a trial ball, that knocked out a strike - the cannonade, that followed him, shattered the whole kegling. A great continuation of the ingenious game, Portal 2 can compete well with Half-Life 2.Despite all the Hollywood antics, impeccable humor and matured gameplay, Portal 2 remains a set of puzzles and theatrical fantastic first-person game.Another advantage of the game this is joint company! Despite the rather modest duration, it can be regarded as a very pleasant dessert after the main dish. Great opportunity to solve puzzles with a friend.

Not only that, it also delivers something else: a dark, black-humor-ish atmosphere that bestows upon the game a deeper sensation, thus envolving more thoroughly the player.It should also be mentioned that the soundtrack of this game is truly remarkable and original to its core. It really was a breath of fresh air to me.Valve, once again, has not disappointed.

100% Hippo	Recommended	50.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/100PercentHippoSteam/	Portal 2 does everything right for a puzzle game. Great puzzles, terrific dialog, lengthy campaign, fun co-op, a level editor, mod support... what more could you ask for? The gameplay is very unique, the portals especially lead to satisfying levels and very interesting interactions with the other game mechanics. The 'test chamber' premise works extremely well to make self contained levels that make sense with the story, but at times you also get the feeling of blazing your own trial even within the contained environments. The characters and quips are hilarious and memorable, and even people who haven't played the game have probably heard retellings of some of the jokes. The co-op campaign makes sure to force you to work together at times while also providing ample opportunities to mess with your partner. Even once you've played through the campaign twice and beaten the co-op with everyone on your friends list, you can still go back and expierience it all again through community made levels and mods (Thinking with Time Machine and Aperature Tag are ones I've played and really enjoyed). If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and pick it up (or wait for the periodic sales), it's well worth it.For more puzzle game and platformer recommendations,  check out my Curator page

Bach	Recommended	1,022.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DownWithTheSickness/	Great sequel to the inarguably best puzzle game ever. Portal 2 expands the story of it's predecessor and gives a lot of new elements to add to the game challenge. It also has better graphics and longer gameplay.
Svirt	Recommended	49.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/svirt/	The game Portal 2 contains one of the most interesting stories I have ever seen. It's catchy from the start to the end. This game makes you think, not only about the story, but also in the gameplay. You need to logically find out what to do, and sometimes it's very difficult. You gotta love Glados' sarcasm, Wheatley's madness and of course Cave Johnson's ideas. 10/10

Nexiu	Recommended	4.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/	Very fun game to play if you feel like sitting back and playing something more casual. Puzzles are fun and challenging, and the graphics are nice. The farther you get, the more you have to use your head. Some puzzles can seem pretty impossible at a first look, but it really makes you think. My favorite thing about this game was any conversation with Wheatley (The robot who accompanies you throughout most of the game). I liked him very much. Definitely recommend if you like to play something snatchy.P.S. I'm in space. :D

The co-op system is a ton of fun, especially if you enjoy annoying your friends. The Steam Workshop support is great and adds so much replay ability. The only issue is the image that appears online cannot be changed without a reupload. Overall if you haven't played this game, get it. Its worth every cent. :p2turret:

Portal 2 offers not only a full-length, involving single player experience, but a co-op that is entirely its own that will most certainly be fun for you and your friends. One of my favorite games of all time. Hilarious, intelligent, well-made. Highly recommended.
Rubyghast	Recommended	30.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rubyghast/	The way I found this game was through people playing it on Youtube, this may have spoiled the main plot points, but it gives different opinions on the game, and those opinions were good ones, as when I played the game myself, I loved every moment of it.Chapter 1 handled the introduction of 2 characters (the player themselves and the personality core/sphere Wheatley) well, and was a good tutorial for players who haven't seen/played the previous game. As well as this, the (re)introduction of GLaDOS was done well, and sets the players the tone for how the next segment will go.Chapter 2 was a good introduction back into GLaDOS' test chambers, and had lower difficulty as it was still near the start of the game. It gives introductions on how the Emancipation Grills/'Fizzlers' work and can be used as testing elements. It also introduces brand new testing elements to this game: Lasers/Laser Redirection Cubes and Aerial Faith Plates. These elements are given equal introductions, and are simple to pick up on.Chapter 3 introduces a third testing element: (after some advanced tests using Aerial Faith Plates) Hard Light Bridges. The way that they are used in its introductory chamber is to cross a large pit that is full of toxic goo. Later on, they are used to block Turret fire, which is a creative way to use them. Speaking of Turret fire, this chapter also re-introduces us to the adorable things known as Turrets. They act just like in the first game, and are still as innocent as they used to be. Chapter 4 continues using mixtures of Lasers/Redirection Cubes, Aerial Faith Plates and Hard Light Bridges in it's test chambers. Then, during Chamber 21, the Personality Core 'Wheatley' finds you and helps you escape from the chamber. With the best-worst imitation of an accent I've heard.During this segment, GLaDOS gives you the 'final' test chamber. (Including a heart on the wall! I mean, how could you say no to that!)Chapter 5 sees you go behind the scenes of Aperture, as you sabotage the only weapons that GLaDOS can use against you: Turrets and 'Deadly' Neurotoxin. I liked this part especially because it shows the inner workings of the facility, and how big Aperture really is. It also has some good dialogue too.[THE NEXT PART CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR THE MAIN PLOT/CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE GAME]At the end of Chapter 5, the plot (and Wheatley) decides that the game isn't over yet, and brings you (literally) falling down to Chapter 6.Chapter 6 and 7 are interesting chambers, because you not only have to use portals and puzzle elements in the chambers themselves, but to get from chamber-to-chamber. The new testing elements of the three Gels was interesting, but I feel like Conversion Gel (White) is 'broken' when you use it in the PeTI (Chamber Building) because when you put it into a chamber you know that people will over use it.Story-wise, these chapters give a backstory to GLaDOS, and how she was made. Which was a nice addition. The puzzles, I feel, had a difficulty spike here, mostly in between chambers, when you have to get to the next Testing Sphere.Chapter 8... Chapter 8. Back in 'modern' Aperture and Wheatley's sheer idiocy has basically sent the facility into meltdown. The chapter shows just how the mainframe has changed him, and most of his dialogue is humorous. He's still evil though. The chapter introduces Excursion Funnels, which are used to move vertically, across gaps (in this case, bottomless pits) and to push buttons that are on the walls and ceilings. Oh, and Frankenturrets: two Turrets fused to a Storage Cube, which are the basic cube for this chapter instead of the regular Storage Cubes. (They're admittedly cute, and I wouldn't mind having a real one.)Chapter 9: 'The Part Where He Kills You'. Dragged the title out, a little bit (GLaDOS and Wheatley's dialogue,  the achievement and the soundtrack title all variants of the title) but it was funny the first time. This Chapter is the final one, and is basically an escape sequence where Wheatley throws EVERYTHING at you. There are two parts where you have to be quick with portals, which the game switches round if you shoot the wrong one, which is very kind. Also introduces Bombs. They'll be useful later.Also contains my favourite quote of the gameFinally, the Boss Fight and Credits: The boss fight was done well, using some of the elements from earlier in the game. And bombs. (Told you they'd be useful)I was fine with the difficulty of the boss fight, but it only uses the Gels, and nothing else. I would have liked to see some other testing elements in there, like Hard Light Bridges or Excursion Funnels, but the Gels were worked well into this part, so I'll let it slide for now.The credits were courtesy, once again, of Ellen McLain, and her wonderful singing.Nothing more to add than, in short, this game deserves the awards it's won, and is one of the best games I've played in a while.Oh, and the Co-Op mode is fun to play after the main game.It's own small campaigns are unique and add some information as to what GLaDOS did after Chell left. Nice touch Valve.

Kramola	Recommended	0.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pudd1n/	For starters, this game is the reason I got a Steam account in the first place. My brother's friend came over with the 360 disc and I stayed up all night playing. Then, of course, he took the game when he left. I immediately wanted to continue playing, I was hooked from that point forward. Played through the entirety of it on some awful computer and getting 20 FPS average. It was worth every second of it, honestly. The campaign is, of course, one of the standout singleplayer modes of gaming. The difficulty curve is well-done, the humor is always well-executed and there's tons of places to listen to additional dialogue if you feel like waiting to see what happens.Then, of course, the co-op is a solid continuation of said singleplayer but continues the curve with the addition of a second set of portals and, of course, another person to cooperate with. I have tons of good memories with friends and randoms alike, especially the moments where you have to decide if you REALLY want to solve right then and there or if you want to move the bridge your partner's relying on.And, to top it all off, there's a leaderboard system that allows you to go for least time/portals with your friends. To this day I occasionally check on my scores to make sure nobody's beaten them, and it's always a pleasant surprise when someone has.All in all, the game's simply amazing. If the fact that it's the #1 rated game on Steam with 121,015 Positive reviews to 1,586 Negative doesn't indicate its sheer quality, I don't know what will. It's a great game that came from a time when Valve still made them, and it will forever hold a special place in my heart.

SurrealSaxhleel	Recommended	44.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/surrealsaxhleel/	This game carries on the legacy of the first Portal game by introducing new gameplay elements, mechanics and characters. Portal 2 is a masterpiece that is satisfying to play and makes once again stepping into the shoes (or rather, Long Fall Boots) of Chell a very fun experience. With a singleplayer and co-op campaign, the game is a huge improvement on the original and even puzzle and physics-based games as a whole. Having accidentely awakened GLaDOS after defeating her in the first game, Chell is given a new Portal Gun and begins testing once again under the watchful eye of GLaDOS. Along with a new Personality Core called Wheatley, the two travel through the test chambers, hoping to find an exit from the hell that is Aperture Science.With new testing elements such as a tractor beam that can push and pull objects based on what direction it's going, blue gel that makes surfaces bouncy, and aerial faith plates which launch you into the air, Portal 2 makes coming back to Aperture Science a fun, refreshing experience. The puzzles in the first one were basic and limited to cubes, energy pellets and Turrets, but those were extremely fun and this game builds on the already great mechanics.Storyline wise, it's basic, but it works! There's one particular plot twist in it that will catch you by surprise, and the characters and voice acting in this game are just amazing, in every sense of the word. I found GLaDOS to be an excellent villian that had a very good sense of passive-aggressiveness toward Chell, Wheatley to be a fun character that was delightful to see everytime (P.S. he reminds of an actually funny version of C-3PO), and frankly I just enjoyed what the game had to offer in terms of character development.Overall, you most definitely should get this. Excellent in every way possible, though there's not a lot of replay value. That's ok, because you can make and play test chambers created by and other players for brand-new problem solving.10/10

S4nta ❄	Recommended	16.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S4ntaCl4us/	Portal 2 is a very, VERY excellent game. Being the sequel to the GOTY Portal, I was expecting it to not be as good. But, upon starting and playing the game, I realized I was immensly wrong. The setting is immersive the moment you see it, and it still has the fun, portal-based puzzle style to it. With the addition of many more mechanics (gels, lightbridges, etc.) this game provides many hours of fun and thinking. The ever present GLaDOS is much more cold-hearted, but with the addition of Wheatly, Portal 2 still has the wit and charm of the first game. If you have played the first game, this is a MUST-HAVE. If you are new to the series, get it, and see how you like it. Adding together the awesome story, and a multiplayer option that makes both you and a friend of your choice either succeed or argue together, this game definitley worth more than the $20 it is being sold for. 10/10.

Russian Thanos	Recommended	43.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198153870379/	Portal 2 is a Sci-Fi game taking place at least 273 years, 1 month and 20 days after the events of Portal (that has been confirmed). The female protaginist named Chell, a test subject working at Aperture Science after a failed escape Chell and her companion Wheatley, a Core ( a weird robot sphere thing that talks) they accidentley awake GLaDOS the previous antagonist of the first portal game. After recovering the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device Chell Is back to testing, how will she escape?.Pro's- Great Story- Challenging Puzzles- Characters feel alive- Awesome graphics considering the game was made in 2011- Great CO-OP campaign- Epic easy-to-use level editor (you can work at Aperture Science to make tests)- Thousands of levels other people made to download- Countless others Con's- NONE100/10 One of THE BEST GAMES IN EXISTENCE
Jimmidyjimjam	Recommended	103.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimmidyjimjam/	Portal 2 is alike the first Portal game retaining all the mechanics and aspects of the game you already liked and adds more content into every single possible aspect. More levels, more story, more humour, more puzzle mechanics, more atmosphere, more achievements and more campaign modes to play in (AKA the new co-op mode). The singeplayer campaign is a blast to go through with the intriguing story, witty dialogue and puzzles that are tons of fun and the co-op is just as fun as you use the things you learnt in singeplayer for co-op but expanding on much more possibilites on level design with the use of four portals as apposed to two. What I love about this game so much is how even when I'm stuck in the game I still have fun using my brain to figure the level out and there's no other game that comes to mind that is so consistently fun even in situations when confused on what to do. If you do not have this game I really, really, really, really, really recommend for you to get it. It is not only my favourite game in my Steam library but possibly my absolute favourite game of all time. I usually don't give number scores to games but this game would definitely be worthy of a 10/10.
L1NU5	Recommended	44.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LinusGale/	Easily in my top 10 of best PC games of all time, Portal 2 has everything that made the first game popular and expanded it:Great story that leaves you wanting to know more, well thought puzzles with new mechanics, local or online multiplayer, atmospheric music (I'm talking big bucket movie quality here)... It also has new characters and a good voice acting with funny dialog lines.Packed with secrets/easter eggs and beautiful environments, this game will catch you more than a space core shaped pokéball.

yote	Recommended	45.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yoteSR/	This game is great and definitely will be considered a classic. Both campaigns are great. The co-op system is a ton of fun, especially if you enjoy annoying your friends. The Steam Workshop support is great and adds so much replay ability. The only issue is the image that appears online cannot be changed without a reupload. Overall if you haven't played this game, get it. Its worth every cent. :p2turret:
Nano	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Phontharit/	Amazing game, The puzzle are challenging and awesome, althought you might get furious and look up answers on youtube. Co-op are Awesome. I had lots of fun with my friend.10/10 Love this
Merim	Recommended	252.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MerimKastrat/	Its really worth it to get if you love puzzles. If story mode or cooperate mode is not enough for you and you want to play more, workshop has tons of chambers made by people so you can play some custom levels created by them, or if you want to create one yourself thats up to you.Also if you do plan on creating one be sure to always test it out before releasing to make sure its possible to beat it. Seriously, we test subjects dont appreciate impossible puzzles or glitches/bugs. A warning is appreciated though.
Get Me Out	Recommended	35.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dota_lul/	You can't call yourself gamer, if you haven't played this game.
McquacK	Recommended	21.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ducktales4life/	I had a blast playing this Valve game and I definitely recomend you give this game a try. The characters are funny, especially Wheatly and the story is also very thought out. If you are into puzzle games or mind games, then you should play it. But as always, the cake is a lie!
drotz	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/drotzisrare/	Its like portal 1 on steroids its longer, better, harder. It requires bit of thinking in some of the maps and some of the co-op maps. *btw the co-op is the thing i miss in portal 1 :(* i also played this one when i was 9 i skipped the first portal i dont know why. I always wondered why i didnt played it? Now i own it and i see that a pretty nice and relaxing game. Sometimes u need to brainstorm tru the levels (u have to use ur brain its not call of duty :P). 11/10 <3
J a d ™	Recommended	3.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/more-goo/	Best ex girlfriend sim ever! 9/10
Trademark™	Recommended	5.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/harklept/	A great sequel to the already popular older game "Portal".A creepy setting with more of a backstory than the first, you meet a "friend" named Wheaty as you both try to escape.After activating (because "turned on" is sexual and strange to say when starting a computer) GladOS or that ♥♥♥♥♥ from the first game, you are literaly flung into testing chambers again as Wheaty tries to break you out. Only to later find out that he is crazy and ends up nearly killing you and GladOS. Through playing this game you learn the secrets behind the company and its founder as you travel into the older parts of the labs.I feel that this Portal has more of a story, while the first game focused more on helplessness and not being in control while being watched. I also feel more connected to this game, getting into this universe and being surprised with the shocking turn of events that take place. Sure, I'm not good with puzzel games, so I had to cheat a little and no clip to get to other parts of the game. (I am special. OK?) I am happy with the end results and the ending (no, I am not telling).Stuff:Sounds: 9/10 - Wheaty and GladOS are amazing in this game, and the sounds help too, the voice acting is great!Soundtrack: 10/10 - Here is a fact, and just youtube it if you don't belive me, aparently the soundtrack is so large and it   changes with the gameplay, it will take years for one song to repeat itself.Graphics: 8/10- Ok, Ok, its getting up there with age, but it is still good. I now feel like I am in some Sci-Fi Lab where crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥happens.ConTROLLS: 8/10 - Same from last game, left mouse for one portal, right mouse for the other.Story: 10/10 - Some secrets are spilled.Overall: 98/100This was a great game, but a game where I will only play once, because it is so linear. There is no choice. Sure, I may go back a try some puzzels without cheating.Maybe a Portal 3? Please? :)
Hunt3r	Recommended	23.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HuntTHREEr/	Well,there is probably nothing to say about this game,because there are no words existing that could describe this truly amazing franchise.In my opinion there will be no Portal 3,because i think that Chell's story will continue in Half-Life 3 (if it will come out of course).Shortly,if you have completed this game before,but a lot of time has passed you should definetly play this game again for some nostalgia.
Linking-Yellow	Recommended	3,111.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenKnightTim/	Portal 2 is an amazing game. If you are considering getting the game, the only problem is that you don't own it yet. The story is completely unforgetable, the gameplay is completely unique, and the puzzles are addicting. The Coop campaign is amazing and really makes you and your friend work together in a way that no other game can require. After you have played the singleplayer and/or multiplayer campaigns, there are an infinite amount of custom chambers you can play, and you can also get carried away with creating your own custom chambers. The game has a really simple level designer, where you can create puzzles almost as complecated as you want for either one or two players. I have played over 2 and a half thousand hours of this game, and I am still enjoying creating and playing custom chambers almost every week.

Bob & Weave	Recommended	13.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120632907/	 Portal 2 Pros: + Longer game+ More changeling puzzles that are at a good difficultly level+ More dialogue+ Better story compared to the first one+ Better ending compared to the first one+ Get on sale for a great price+ Learn more lore of the Portal world Cons: -  Still no cake- Some puzzles will make you dumb- Middle drags on for sometime without any dialogue Review Portal 2 brings back what you love from the first Portal and improves on many other areas. After playing the first Portal relatively quickly, I started up Portal 2 and sat down thinking it would be as short as the first one. I was wrong, this game has much more meat than the first Portal. It was fun to shoot portals across large areas and teleport across them. What I loved about Portal 1 and Portal 2 is that it all can be done without a walkthrough, but it's not easy either. It has an interesting start and a legendary ending. The middle part wasn't that amazing, but it wasn't bad either. All in all, I am happy that I finally played the two Portal games, and even though I am not a huge fan of puzzle games it was still enjoyable. It is a great buy when it's on sale.

Then I think it over again until I found the way to success. Because what's the point of buying a puzzle game if you're gonna spoil yourself to it?. Just keep calm and never give up, if Plan A didn't work, the alphabet has 25 more letters! Check every corner that you can use your portal.sorry if my english is bad

Olde	Recommended	23.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/olde72/	Great game, but get it when it's on sale. I no longer feel it's worth $20. I found myself quite burned out after playing the single player. This game introduces new elements and has a very fun coop mode. Also has lots of mods, so you're getting a lot of content for a single game. I'd still wait until it's on sale, though.
Yea Boi	Recommended	29.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146215676/	portal 2 is a 1 in a life time game. it has everything; comedy, action, sci fi, a story plot, puzzle and an awesome song in credits.

[S.T.A.L.K.E.R.] jackloko99	Recommended	106.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028069277/	Thanks to the steam workshop (and the great geniuses contributing creating challenging and intelligent chambers) this could be considered in my opinion as a completely innovative game where the goal of each chamber is to make you think. The huge diversity of chambers created each week by community makes this game an infinite and ever new fun. If I had to choose only one game to play the rest of my life, it would definitely be the Portal 2, a true masterpiece of the valve and his beautiful source engine.

Yuniac	Recommended	15.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YMsabbag/	ever heard of a one way out only? well, that fact doesn't exist in portal 2, where somehow our fellow Scientist managed to invent the 'portal gun' which opens up quite the unlimited possibilities in terms of how to move between places and transport yourself and way more control over materials and how to move them freely in a never seen way before. yet in the wrong hands or rather extremely Scientific hands, thirsty for more knowledge about what we have created, lead them to create the 'test chambers'.you, as the player, you have to go through them, testing and solving puzzles.as the game advance, or you advance in the game the puzzles become more ... not frustrating, like many other games -of this type- becomes after you reach the advanced levels. no, in portal 2 the levels become more ... creative, more appealing to play without repeating itself, using the old 'tools' at your disposal, the old methods but with a new taste it feels, which keep the game fresh, not boring and undoubtedly enjoyable.yet you might enjoy it, but the character you are playing is not, in fact, it's his prison, spending your life testing and solving puzzles doesn't sound good does it?and here where your real mission start ... not testing any more chambers but... but finding your freedom ...escaping to what behind those cold metal walls, to what beyond this harsh iron sealing above you, to see the world and beyond, to visit the space maybe...do you want your freedom? go get it.recommended 10/10.
Andi	Recommended	2,142.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AJLauer/	By far and away, the best game in existence.  Portal was one of the best games of all time, then came Portal 2, the perfect follow up.  I’ve logged in about 2100 hours playing portal 2 and I have no intention of stopping.Pro:- Richly detailed world- Unique puzzle elements- Lengthly game play- Engaging storyline- Plot twist- And many, MANY puzzlesCons:- (I’ll let you know if I ever come up with any)Once finished with the original game you can see your own creations come to life by building your own chambers.  The editor is a bit limited so if you really want to make a truly custom chamber, I suggest that you learn how to program in Hammer.At the time of this review, Portal 2 was selling for $19.99.  Well worth it.  Don’t wait for a sale, buy it now.
Big Bob	Recommended	53.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BobPony/	This game is actually pretty amazing in my own opinion, it actually feels like an adventure on going to many different places outside rather than being an inside room of testing chambers and facing the challenges in the game. If you already have Portal, then I'll highly recommend that you go buy this game. It's worth the game, especially if you're a fan of the Portal Series and if you want co-op with a friend, also to have fun with community test chambers by people in the Steam Workshop. I'll rate this game 10/10

DasBoSchitt	Recommended	43.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DasBoSchitt/	Game of the year, and screw you if you think otherwise.  Both the single player and co-op games have exceeded all my expectations.  The single player story reaches up to 8 hours of play this time around, offering jaw dropping environments and a LOT more complex portal puzzles with a dozen new elements sure to put even the most clever of players through their paces.  The brilliant writing is back, piecing together the mystery behind Aperture Labs through observing the scenery and of course, enjoying the extremely hilarious lines brought about by pre-recorded PA messages before the disaster, and the dialogue from the few main characters.  Finally, the co-op mode makes full, clever use of both players that's sure to keep you and your friend glued to the game for extended periods of time.  Aside from little replay value, I can't think of a single complaint beyond that.  This is the most fun you will have with a game for a long time.
sKp_Zombie	Recommended	19.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpoockerZombie/	We want Portal 3
Crazher	Recommended	51.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crazher/	Portal 2, 'nuff said. I do not think that any more needs to be said, this is one of the most brilliant puzzle/logic games ever to see the light of day on Steam - it mixes the dark/satirical humor that we all know and love from Portal 1, with even more shenanigans and evil twists from both previous and new characters, and if you're one for Portal "lore", so to speak, then this will shed some light on a lot of questions that were left from Portal 1.Replayed it recently, still a great co-op classic even if you've beaten it before.
Zorder	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/	I finally got around to beating Portal 2. It was a great one. Once more Valve manages to provide flawless and fun gameplay with great narrative and storytelling, I admire the fact that in most of their games the main character doesn't speak. It still looks and feels great, even after almost 3 years after its release. It is fun both in single player and cooperative online multiplayer. There's tons of mods and user made maps out there so there's alot to play. If you're looking for a casual game to play with a friend or just by yourself there's no way in the world that you will go wrong with Portal 2, it's the sequel to one of the greatest first person puzzle games of all time.
kshdnz	Recommended	28.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/prvrs/	It may be short, but boy is it sweet. Portal 2 is again one of those rare, perfect games.Playing through Portal, you'll be treated to delightfully subversive dark humor, which slowly gives way to a creepy, sinister atmosphere. The gameplay is rock-solid, too - challenging, but not unfair to the player. And without spoiling anything I can tell you that Portal has one of the best video game characters this side of 2000.Long after you've finished it, this game will stick with you.
Sigmar	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116527414/	Brilliant! You train your spatial intelligence in test environments of sometimes dizzying proportions, run through an exciting science-fiction escape story and enjoy dry and black humour somewere between Ricky Gervais' UK-Office and Fallout's Vault Tec experiments. This game offers good graphics, very good voices and sound effects, and for shooter fans even some opportunities to destroy machine gun turrets with laser beams and blue goo. What fun - 8/10!

Kaká	Recommended	24.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/milaa12/	O que dizer sobre Portal 2? Jogo DELICIOOOOOOOOOSO  e uma maravilhosa continuação do 1, com umas surpresas e descobertas a mais. Seu modo co-op também é super divertido e COM CERTEZA super recomendo. Se você for uma pessoa muito ousada, pegue todas as conquistas  e mostre o quão bem você domina sobre  gravidade, transferência de matéria e criação de energia. Brinque mesmo! São um bom número de horas que valem a pena cada segundo. Seja paciente e observe bem, não há nada acima de sua capacidade. Definitivamente, 10/10.

Jon	Recommended	59.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jon4nD/	Maravilloso juego que te tiene pegado a el hasta que seas capaz de resolver todos sus puzzles. Si estás cansado de jugar siempre a lo mismo y queréis un reto, Portal (tanto ésta como su primera entrega) es vuestro juego. Desafiante a más no poder y que además goza con una comudidad enorme para que podáis seguir disfrutando con más niveles.Pocos son los juegos que consiguen engancharme, pero Portal es uno de ellos y en mi opinión uno de los mejores que hay.En definitiva, ¡tenéis que jugarlo! )

EP!C0 G4M3R0	Recommended	36.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Augrer/	I love this game for many reasons,but I'm going to try to cut it short.The story is funny at points which I think makes it even better to play and I just love those puzzles and if you like games like  that you'll love this one.Whats also amazing is all the Chambers people make if you played it through and not many of your friends have it just play the community made maps.So I would say buy it if you really like these kind of games because I didn't regret it and I think you won't either.
Fuck Kevin Durant	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EnigmaEditing/	An Absolutely thrilling tale that will have you gripped to your screen for ages. Almost Everything in this game is perfect, The Characters, Their Development, Voice acting, Gameplay and Just so much more. It also host a new, fun co-operative Mode, which in itself is highly entertaining. The only downsides to this game is that their is no real competitive play, but otherwise An Amazig game. If you are wondering whether to play it or not, I Highly reccomend grabbing a copy.
Nerfed2Much	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198184082637/	For the longest time I thought this was a shooter game and about 7 hours into this game I started to wonder how long the tutorial was x_x. I am really more of an Action, Adventure, and RPG Fan that pretty much go "Kill that guy, shoot him, level up, get better, play harder bosses, and etc", but I tried the co-op with my friend and it was pretty fun. We did a lot of brainstorming and eventually had to look up a few things on youtube. I really liked how it was challenging in a different way from other games such as CS:GO, TF2, Geometry Dash, Etc. where difficulty is how fast you can click a certain button combination or how you have to play like you have an extreme case of ADHD and drank 10 cups of coffee. In this game difficulty is thinking strategically, several steps ahead and planning out exactly what to do, thinking outside the box, playing out all posibilities in your head. Or you can just search Youtube, that works too. I would reccomend playing with a friend if you can. Overall 10/10 shootergame would infinitly fall again.

Fan4eG	Recommended	201.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ffan4eg/	Portal 2 — блистательная, остроумная, исполненная с удивительным чувством вкуса и меры игра.Парадоксальным образом большая часть хвалебных возгласов отведена критике.

Fake IDDQD	Recommended	20.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fakeiddqd/	Very fun puzzle game. The single player was expanded and improved on from the original, and the co-op mode leaves for many hours of fun with friends. Very highly recommended!
LB	Recommended	975.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/_LB/	This is my favorite game of all time. There is so much polish, so much depth, and so much replay value. Obviously nothing changes each time you replay it, but the experience is addicting. Not only is there a full single-player campaign and a co-op campaign with free DLC, there's also user-created content and a level editor now. Don't worry about the limitations of the build-in level editor either - users can still use external level editors to create levels that are impossible to create with the in-game editor.If you like puzzles, sci-fi, and dark humor, buy this game now.

DroP	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DroP90/	What a delightful game to play, that's how I define Portal 2. The first had been very good, but the second can be even better, the gameplay is unique, the puzzles are interesting and warrant a good deal of satisfaction when solved, especially those that you have more trouble passing. Enjoyed the development a lot, the idea of the 2 robots and how you interact with them, brilliant, and the ending is very good and comforting too. The graphics are beautiful, the sounds, perfect, I can not imagine any defect to assign to it, perhaps it could be longer. Now I want to try cooperative with a friend.9/10

SavvyNormal	Recommended	60.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SavvyNormal/	Synopsis: Portal 2 is a good game.The gameplay is the fun first person puzzling you would expect from the series. The puzzles are challenging enough to get you to use your brain but not the point of rage quitting . The multiplayer added a new challenge: cooperation. So pick a partner that is smarter than a sack of potatoes.The visuals are good having that classic source engine look to them.The sound was not too bad and the soundtrack comes free with the game.The story was really fun, being pushed forward by the hilarious dialogue between Wheatley and Glados.I really enjoyed the single player campaign whereas the multiplayer very was dependent on my partners seriousness on that particular day.It takes 6-9 hours beat the singleplayer campaign and I rate it a 7/10.
Spongie	Recommended	27.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/spongeboburu/	Valve. They just cannot be caught sucking in any way shape or form. Another brilliant title with great Linux support.Using your portal gun you must navigate through a rich and diverse environment. The puzzle variations seem endless and the community content (anyone can edit and publish maps) makes for an endless stream of trials.The game is wonderfully produced, awesome voice acting, cool music, breath taking sceneries and gameplay is super fun. Get it.5/5
DigiM	Recommended	120.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/digimaniac321/	My experiences with the Portal series are really worth remembering.This game is what introduced me to Steam, my friend told me about Portal, and he told me it was on steam.The hype of Portal 2 is really huge, due to it being a sequel to the original Portal, part of the Orange Box. Portal really hyped up the community with its portal mechanics (inspired by Narbacular Drop), sad to say it was really short, so the community demanded a sequel, which originates Portal 2.First gameplay through Portal 2, puzzles are really confusing, requiring you to think outside the box. Luckily, either GLaDOS, Wheatly or Cave are there to hint the players to go through the puzzles. There are lots of new mechanics too, especially the paint mechanics (inspired by Tag: The Power of Paint). The story is good and its comedy won't bore you. The game has a well made narration, showing the good and bad sides of each character.The other thing that hyped it up was the Coop mode. Portals alone are confusing enough, now we have two sets of portals waiting to solve tons of other puzzles provided. This mode requires lots of cooperation and teamwork, and also a keen eye on possible solutions. Portal 2 also provided lots of utilities for coop plays, like gestures to express emotions, ping to show stuff, or even timers to sync in movement.Once singleplayer and coop was done, nothing else is able to be done besides repeating the stories or doing challenges. Until, Valve released the workshop. Portal 2 was associated with the Steam Workshop, giving players a chance to create their own maps with ingame tools and playing endless amount of maps created by other players. This revived the Portal 2 hype, having players back on the game, creating maps and playing maps. Some maps are insanely hard, some maps are for casual players who love to stroll and play around.ConclusionPuzzle SP/Co-op FPS game, challenging your mind to think outside the box while refreshing you with comedy and silly stuff. In-game Co-op features are well made. The workshop implementation also gives it a big boost, for players to come back and play new maps created everyday.
RetroOne	Recommended	60.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RetroOne/	Portal 2 is everything I loved about Portal but more. Better story, Better music, Better graphics, and more importantly better load times.

senpi_0	Recommended	33.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/senpi_0/	This game is just so complete, the first one, with only 19 chambers, and with almost no history was already pretty good, and this one, it just brings back everytinhg that was good from the first game, adds some new stuff, and well, it's just incredibly great! Even 5 years after the game's release, it is still my favorite game of all time!I finished this game at least 5 times, and every time, it's always great, the ending always gets some emotion out of me. Now, we just have to expect the third installment in the series is even better than this one, if it ever comes out that is.

Almost Everything in this game is perfect, The Characters, Their Development, Voice acting, Gameplay and Just so much more. It also host a new, fun co-operative Mode, which in itself is highly entertaining. The only downsides to this game is that their is no real competitive play, but otherwise An Amazig game. If you are wondering whether to play it or not, I Highly reccomend grabbing a copy.

Telaneo	Recommended	95.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Telaneo/	Great puzzle game which makes your brain churn and think in new ways. Portals, jumps, inertia, platforms, lasers, gun turrets and triggers all come together to make a consecutive series of great puzzles with a very smooth and fun difficulty curve, all with a great chunk of humour thrown in there.The multiplayer is more of the same, but is kinda limited to a fun night with a friend, as you won't be replaying the multiplayer, or for that matter the singleplayer, at least not for a while after you've finished the game, as the puzzles get very easy once you've played through it once and you get used to the way Portal wants you to think.Buy the Portal bundle and get the original while you're at it and you'll have a good few nights of pure video games fun.
⚡v1sion	Recommended	26.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iccrrxz/	Bought this game mainly for co-op, and it worth every cent! Had so much fun with my buddy. Recommended this if you are looking for a co-op puzzle game to play with friends
effyluna	Recommended	38.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/effyluna/	I discovered Portal and Portal 2 quite a while after the release of Portal 2, so I played them back to back. Then over again, then co-op with friends. I still find the story so amazing and exciting! It's a beautiful game that you won't regret purchasing.
600piecesof8	Recommended	44.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PhdZemph/	Does Portal 2 live up to my expectations?Well, the first Portal was a challenging logic puzzle game, with lotsa sarcasm and irony on top. I enjoyed the game very much, but personally didn't (in general) like some of the faster paced reaction bits or having to place Portals while upside down and backwards (though they weren't going to hard on that). Portal had about 70% logic and 30% reaction puzzles aka Test Chambers. Only downturn was, that the (intentionally) grey and sterile environment kept the girls away from playing.So, this game adds some Cockney speaking companion, has the old fun bits, remains solid in the core and adds really wonderful new gimmicks. All of them are lovely, but the Gels "stick" out for me, because they open up incredible possibilities. Apart from the gels, the game is in general more colourful than its predecessor since the story after the end of Portal allows that. Now it is about 80-90% logic puzzles which are not just recycled old ideas. To the contrary, the game hasn't really maxed out the sheer endless options and this is there the community comes in.This is about one of the biggest games ever, since there are hundreds of free community test chambers to download and easily to integrate which makes the game extremely valuable - not only on sale!Sadly, there are more of these factory/outdoor debris maps, where most effort remains simply looking for the portable surface. The icing on the cake is the Co-Op Multiplayer, which should be really part of any good workplace team building effort. This hypes the game to a complete new level. Portal 2 reassures the community that Valve stands for witty quality games.Highly recommend this game; don't see anything worse compared to Portal and most of it better. You don't need to play the first part, but it helps to enjoy some comments even the better.

Demopan	Recommended	107.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GeoTheTank/	Portal 2 lives up to the high expectations placed upon it after the award winning portal, and surpasses them.For those who don't know, here's how the game works, you start off learning the very basics of the game in the way valve does best, with humor and semi-realistic reasons for it being explained. After you get the hang of moving and controlling your camera, you get the device called a portal gun, this lets you shoot 2 portals that are connected, from there you are released upon the rest of the game. Using gravity and portals, you fling yourself around the game to complete different objectives, with new things being added as the game goes on, but at a pace that the player has completely learned the use of something previous before the new items.Valve lives up to its name once again with this game that uses humor, story telling, and puzzles in ways never before used. I definite must buy if you can afford it.

Remember the 1hour really fun game with Portals? Well, Portal 2 is here with a great length, hugely improved over Portal 1 and more creative puzzles that make you stop and think sometimes unlike the firsts easy puzzles.You have a portal gun, that creates Portals, you use these potals to go through test chambers and from the start you just "solve puzzles" (No, actually just that) until the whole story turns around!

❤Snowy Heart❤	Recommended	26.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowyHeart/	Bought it because I had a coupon from crafting badges; At first, I only expect a full puzzle game with little amounts of story. However, it turns out a lot different than I expected, It has a really great story and it intergrates a lot of humor, which keeps me going. Although at times the puzzles are difficult to solve, you can eventually find the solution if you spend a bit more time looking around carefully. I highly recommend this game.
Fireflames	Recommended	17.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073751813/	A masterpiece. One of the best games I've ever played. Takes the brilliance and innovation of the original Portal and expands on it into a fully-fledged title. Maintains an extremely high standard of writing from start to finish.

The game allows coordination through a ping tool that drops a marker where you're looking that the other player can see.Subtitles/TextThe game is fully captioned, so deaf/hoh can play single player effectively without missing anything.  Multiplayer games do not require subtitles.Chatting/CommunicatingYou can use text chat in multiplayer games to augment the ping tool.
Shimakaze	Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MattyPro01/	Beautiful game, the final part very unexpected but nice.
ilyAD	Recommended	19.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ohflawless/	The single player is amazing. But everyone already knows that so, we will talk about the Multiplayer. Okay so me and my friend played the Co-Op. Depending on who you play with will decided if you will enjoy it. Personally I suck at this game, but my friend is really good. So I put my friend through actually pain because of how bad I am. But this makes the game enjoyable so we stan and we recommend
rinle	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mandarpowale/	Awesome game. Totally worth the price as I bought this game during sale. I had a lot of fun solving the puzzles. I am yet to try the multiplayer even though I bought this to play for the singleplayer experience. The creator of the levels are geniuses.As of writing this review I am yet to play the chapter 'The Itch' and onwards.Edit: 23-8-2016 ---> I did finish the story mode of the game without any help, it feels exhilarating, so you can too probably. I did die many times but I didn't have to refer to any help. Portal 2 is a tons of fun to play especially when you figure out the puzzles all by yourself, which I did.P.S:- It glitched once and I had to refer to an youtube video to identify the glitch. But I reloaded from an earlier point and the glitch did not repeat itself.

Good Ol' Steemy	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yourpalsteemy/	Fantastic mind bending game! Id go as far as to say its my Greatest Puzzle Game of 2013 (When I played it on My console when I was younger). The puzzles are really challenging, but not to the point where you get frustrated, and when you solve them you feel so much smarter. The Story is pretty funny with manyt lovable characters. Purchase this game if its on sale and you want a few weeks worth of fun.And if thats doesnt suit your fancy there are community maps which are absolutley amazing. Like really they are just fantastic. They make thier own stories with them and seperate boss fights and Oh! Its Fun :D.

The narratoris dry and sarcastic, and very funny, and the story is well done; it helpsyou propel through the game even when you are stumped by whatever puzzleyou may be working on.The game performs smoothly, with will done level design.  The puzzlesare based off of manipulating the levels with a portal gun, as well asusing gravity and physics when necessary.  The difficulty and level designprogress in a balanced way, and does a great job of leading you in a linearfashion, but leaving you to solve the puzzles on your own.  Awareness ofthe details of the map is key.For someone who likes puzzle games, this is an easy recommend.This is a summary of what I talk about in the video I am a YT'er not a blogger.Thanks for your viewership and support for more videos check click here.http://www.youtube.com/user/SocioPyscho 
diegowakko	Recommended	43.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/diegowakko/	One of the best games I've had the pleasure of playing! The Portal series is perfectly thematic, makes you want to stay in the game to end. The portal characters are a hit piece, you who played the first Portal, and not like the Glados? And you're going to play Portal 2 now, can not help but fall in love with Wheatley, for me is one of the best video game characters of all time. In short, want to play the best game that Valve already produced and one of the best games ever made? Buy Portal 2!This game is Amazing!

I enjoy building my own test chambers in the editor, and am learning how to use Hammer to make more advanced levels. The only downside to this game is some mild language, but there is very little. All in all, a great game.

DignifiedxPeach	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dignifiedpeach/	Portal 2 Review By DignifiedPeachThis is the kind of game that you buy if you want to think. Consult your doctor before purchasing to see if you can handle it.Just kidding, but seriously, after you get past the first 6 or 7 chapters, which takes about an hour for some, maybe a couple for most, you actually have to think outside of your companion cube. later you end up going to the restricted testing facility, which is almost completely destroyed. with only a portal gun to aid you, it may get extremely difficult. I haven't played through the whole game but I do have 13 hours logged. This is a fantastic game, expecially the fact that I got it and portal 1 for 6 bucks.Good game.Oh, and there's co-op.

Chris	Recommended	769.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cjlerch/	It baffles me as to why I haven't reviewed this yet. I've owned it for almost two years, and I've even created maps for it, albiet terrible ones. It's an amazing first-person puzzle game which offers players a chance to push their brains to the limits. And that's only the Singleplayer. For even more excitement, you can do the Co-Operative campaign, which offers an even tougher experience, as you need both players'... cooperation. Both stories are as amazing as the puzzles, so even if you find the puzzles easy, you can at least enjoy the story. And, again, even if you don't enjoy the story, there are literally thousands of community created levels from you to choose from, each with a certain theme. While most offer the 'Into the Multiverse' theme, narrated by the Aperture founder and CEO himself, others can have their own complex storyline and theme. I'd give this game a 10/10 rating. If you buy it, you'll likely get one of the best games on the market.

Mr. Watterson	Recommended	284.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/themrwatterson/	What can I say...Even after 3 years (!) the game is still worth buying. Not only for the PTI because in the year 2015 a lot of mods are going to be relased. For instance:-Alive & Kicking- a total remake of the first portal.-Conversion (sadly might be cancelled because of the hard political state of Ukraine ;( )- The only thing that I can say. It will be awesome.-Repercussions- From the videos of it I can say that: Valve quality. Made by the same guy that created the Black Mesa: Source mod.-Portal Stories: Mel- Developed by the guy above and a couple of other great modders.And that`s only the top of the ice mountain of additional content that will be relased.So... buy it even if you know everything about it, because the golden era of this game will start very soon! ;3

YUKIHIRA	Recommended	2.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/binura/	If there is one game that I would recommend to anyone of any age, without any doubts, its definitely Portal 2. There are no open points in this game for someone to easily criticize. This is a very unique experience which you almost can't compare to other games. I cannot say its the best game I have played but it is most certainly one of the most memorable games I've played. So far, the best story I have seen in a game as well. Truly a title you will never regret playing!
Yogo	Recommended	25.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yogo19/	Portal 2 is a unique game with an amazing story, great characters and marvelous voice-acting! The idea is pretty simple, you put portals and walk through them, but the way it's made is the thing that makes that game perfect - the puzzles, the interactions, everything is just perfectly done.  It also has co-op, workshop, level editor and many achievements, which is amazing, since you can continue playing for hours and hours, facing new levels and mods, after you complete the main story. In conclusion:Story: 10/10Characters: 10/10Voice-acting: 10/10Graphics: 10/10 -Masterpiece!-Also, try Portal 1. You'll understand the story better, if you play it before its sequel.
Jeith Jones	Recommended	151.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SuporMeAmoto/	Portal 2™ is an essential sequel to the previous game, Portal™. This game is 2x better because its the 2nd game, not only this but you get 2 portals this time around. As you progress through the game, you (Gorgan freeman) along side famous potato sidekick Chell, encounter many trials, tribbles and traps(male) along the way. Portal 2's emphasis on the number 2 is very prominent in the gameplay. You fight 2 bosses, shoot 2 portals, unlock 2 hats, twice jump 2 times, and play as 2 characters, Gaijin Freeman and David Chappell. Although this game has been rated highly by many critiques, and sold 2 million copies worldwide, the creator of the famous dual wormhole masterpiece (Gape Newell) sunk into a deep depression. Unable to have motivation and drive to finish the predecessor to Portal 2™, A ss Portal™. Gape Newell in his time of darkness, spent all of Portal 2's earnings on snowdogs* and the rights to a card game made by a 12 year old chinese boy. It seems we the people will never get another Portal 2™ , But maybe that's for the best.

Orpheus	Recommended	57.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wenoyes/	This is my favourite game. It has an insanely good story, characters, narration and atmosphere. It has new puzzle elements. It's also longer than the first game, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome.If the length of the single player campaign is still unsatisfactory there's also a co-op campaign for two players, which is lots of fun. And if that wasn't enough you get the fortune of community made puzzles for singleplayer and co-op made in the game's easy to use level designer. Start thinking with portals.

Menphues (Kyle)	Recommended	62.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/	Awesome game!  Beats the hell into the original.  More fun as a Co-op but needs more co-op chambers, which is a let down because there isn't that much at the moment.  Amazing game thow!Graphics: The graphics are actually pretty cool to look at and it makes a change from a Valve game, when all their games are the same graphics across the board... Talk about copy paste... Hear they are improved upon.Audio: The audio is amusing, delightful and fun to listen too from running to talking to the bots communicating or even the game dialogue.Controls:The controls are super easy to use and get used too, nothing special or hard to grasp.Game: The game is a massive step forward from the original Portal because now you have coop and a singleplayer campaign.. Both two different set of chambers to enjoy and that is amazing.... You can do the campaign which has it's own missions to solve and then do coop with a friend which is a totally different back story to the game and the game is so much fun with some amazing amusing moments from the cast of the game.The only sad thing is there is not many official chambers to do and once done, they are done and you must rely on the workshop to have more fun....Would I recommend the game? Yes without a doubt.

Wyld Drew	Recommended	1,149.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wyld42/	This is a fun, imaginative game, with co-op levels and a creation mode where you can build your own levels!What more could you ask for?Portal 3!Well, true. But until GLaDOS returns to test the goo out of you...Play Portal 2... Enjoy the cake while you can!
anton	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NPC29454/	Whoah, what a hellride. I didn't excpect this game to be that good, actually. The length is about 10+ hrs, I needed 10.3 and I was kind of addicted to the game. What this game does good are two things - those puzzles obviously but also writing. All the dialogue with all the humour, little gags which you can find and different chambers, because they are actually pretty unique..:spoiler:the scenery varies:spoiler:A really unique experience and I didnt expect to play it through in two days because I really enjoyed it. To all the people who say that this game is actually just a puzzle game with good humour..it is, but also nicely made "story". You really have to play it, it's really a masterpiece and I had more fun with it then with Half Life 2.10/10
Papa Løngsteppy	Recommended	143.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112327607/	One of the coolest games I've ever played! Valve did a good job and is very popular. This game was better than its previous game, Portal. I really liked this game and my friends also like this game. Thanks for reading
X-file	Recommended	71.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkangel677/	Great story, challenging puzzles, awesome coop and of course more GlaDOS around
nock	Recommended	1,389.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/officialnockscitney/	"Portal is life and the cake is not a lie (unless you've just eaten it)"Where do i start with this.  about 20 months ago I knew nothing about portal2.  Now I'm notching up almost 600 hours with the game, having dedicated the majority of my live stream time to the game, and I'm still going strong. There's just something about this game that I can't stop.  The community chambers always offer up something new and exciting to play, which is testiment to the many skilled mappers out there who tirelessly make maps for the game.If you've not played this game and love a mental puzzle, what are you waiting for. You won't be disappointed!

DerpHed	Recommended	119.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/derphed/	One of the greater games I played. Very good storyline, involves a player into it, especially three quarters through the game, since then things start to get real. I'd say it was a good move to put a player into two opposite sites, one wanting to kill the main character and second one to kill an antagonist.The ending is just what you'd never expect. Gets me everytime. Very emotional.One thing to remember through the whole game: revenge."Everybody likes revenge, right?"I definitely recommend this game to everyone, along with Half-life 2, it's just too perfect.Keep making such games, VALVe.

Kazitor	Recommended	272.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kazitornado/	The sequel to 2007's Game of the Year, and this time there are whole new challenges to complete.Once again it is set in Aperture laboratries, with the maniacal GLaDOS (Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System) trying to kill you as you complete test chambers.Singleplayer campaignChell (the character you play as) wakes up in an Aperture relaxation vault, and a robotic voice asks you to do certain actions. This is by far one of the best tutorials I have ever seen, as it manages to add this stage somewhat into the story. You head back to bed and are woken up again after what the computer states as "9-9-9-9-9-9-9... years", to find someone knocking on the door. You open it and find a small robot sphere named Wheatley, and this is where the real journey begins.Multiplayer (or co-operative) campaignYou play as one of two robots, Atlas or P-body; with your partner playing as the other. It is set after the singleplayer campaign, and challenges you to think in an entirely different way. It features the same testing elements, but completely new test chambers. Unfortunately, when playing co-op on Mac or PC, you require a friend who also has bought Portal 2 to play this mode (unless you have a controller, but split-screen on a computer monitor is awful). WARNING: you're co-op partner may (highly likely) have a habit of dying. A lot.Unlike Portal, Portal 2 has a much longer story and a more complicated plot. But don't let this scare you, as the plot has only a few things going on at a time.Also, there are many new testing elements, such as:- Hard-light bridges- Excursion funnels- Thermal discouragement beams- Aerial faith plates- Repulsion gel- Propulsion gel- and conversion gelI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and it has plenty of things to make you come back, like hidden secrets and achievements, and a level editor that lets you create your own test chambers using many of the features available.For a list of Portal 2's many awards, go here[thinkwithportals.com].The official website of Portal 2 is http://thinkwithportals.com.
puffo	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/puffypuffo/	Now, this game is excellent. The sense of scale is great, you can "feel" the absolutely humongous size of the Aperture Science facility, while still being amazingly well optimized. Never went under 70fps with a 750ti, max settings. Just get it. You probably already have it, so go and play it. Already finished? Play it again. Just go. Stop reading this, go and play it.I said go, mate, go.

Pain	Recommended	58.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Pain/	My first Puzzle game on Steam and I must say, I definitely loved this one. Forgot to mention that I bought this game during sale for a mere 0.99$, but I'd recommend you to get this game anyway even at its original price because it's well worth it!Pros:+ Great collection of puzzles+ Pretty Graphics+ Great voice acting+ Good Soundtracks+ Funny and good use of sarcasm+ Co-op with friend is funCons:Absolutely no cons, I find this game flawless, at least to me it is. I do find people complaining about the map editor and the difficulty of community maps, but hey come on don't judge the game by the maps created by the community for you guys! Map editor may take some to get used to it, but once you get going, it's not that tough!Overall an amazing game, a must buy. 10/10 would solve puzzles again.

Solorvox	Recommended	76.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/solorvox/	Hands down the best presented game ever.  Ever part seems to work so well together.  From the graphics and sound, to the story and voice acting.  It clearly shows an experenced team and provides a lot of enjoyment.  The biggest flaw with the game is that it ends.   I want more!

Knitro	Recommended	88.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/knitro/	Outstanding! This is one of the Games that I actually hope for a New one to come out. Brilliant Story and Game Idea. I recommend anyone to get this If you have a thinking brain or just want to challenge yourself. To be truthful, I do wait a couple months then play the campaign again so I partially forget what to do :P. I do slightly prefer if the underground was more obvious on what to do. Other than that, Wonderful!

⸎peth	Recommended	12.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kypeth/	Great sequel. Had very fun puzzles and a pretty fun and silly narrative. Amazing finale and the co-op is equally engaging as the single player campaign. Very recommended!!
Terry's Axtmörder	Recommended	74.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nickfillax/	Lovely story, lovely enemy, lots of humor and also a coop mode basically working as a "sequel"all in all a great game worth its money(also has one of the greatest credit songs i've ever heard)
Kyzi	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kyzi/	Possibly THE worst game in the L4D franchise. Gordon Freeman is a girl now and is being bossed around by some transgender Gman in a spooky eye thing, who is also british. There is no sign of Coach, Bill, Tyrone or the infamous Pillman, who we discovered after playing the first installment of the Minecraft franchise. For a JRPG the combat is pretty weak, the loot system is awful and you can't even speak. (no rhyme intenderino). Overall this game is pretty solid, i'd give it a strong 10/5
CorvusCorax	Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/	A wonderfully-crafted sequel to an already original FPS game! This is, in a nutshell, Portal 2.Released 4 years after its predecessor Portal 2 offers the following new features:--- While the core mechanics return some new elements are present and needed for puzzle solving. My favourite was the gel machine. These machines release gel and the gel-filled surfaces can be used to accelerate the protagonist in order to reach a much higher ground. Also, surfaces can be made available for the use of portals with the gel.--- Again, we have an extremely funny, relatively long and story-based single-player campaign. We have new voice actors (such as Stephen Merchant who usually works with Ricky Gervais - those of you familiar with Gervais's comedies will probably grow to like Stephen immediately) and the usual dark sense of humour is present throughout the single-player adventure.--- Co-op campaign is now available and demands that the two of you closely work together. Some of the stages can be tough (in both campaigns) but they are still heaps of fun.--- Graphics have also been improved. As we are in the same facility but after the events of the first episode, many of the chambers have walls that show aging and / or deterioration. This immediately allows players to immerse themselves in the story and realise that many years have been passed since the previous adventure.The game has numerous mods available and just recently a paint gun mode has been released. As the gel-mechanics was based on a game called Tag: The Power of Paint, it was only natural to see the gun incorporated into the world of Portal. In fact, the creators of that game were hired by Valve and worked on Portal 2.Portal 2 is an excellent sequel and is worth every penny spent on it! This is a highly recommended game along with its predecessor.
DominatorLater	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dominatorlater/	I highly recommend this game. It's story is very well crafted, the puzzles are fun and challenging and the characters and dialogue just immerses you in the game even more.
֍~Koekie~֍	Recommended	4.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/koekie_69/	Great game. Its good to take a break from the usual shooting, kicking and poesing. Some thinking and you`ll figure it out. Its a good game to challenge yourself. The co-op missions are great with a friend and the main missions are also challenging and fun. Would reccomend.
Varaosa	Recommended	49.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/varaosa/	ENG:Definitely one of the best games ever, the top story and a great game you play with a friend, if you like one of the original Portal game, you like this too, twice as much more of everything and a lot more done. Testimonial!FIN:Ehdottomasti yksi maailman parhaista peleistä ikinä, huippu tarina ja loistava peli kaverinkanssa pelattaessa, jos pidät alkuperäisestä portal 1 pelistä, pidät tästäkin, tuplasti enemmän kaikkea ja paljon paremmin tehtyän. Suositteluni!
✨𝓟𝓚𝓛𝓛✨	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pkll921/	Steam should provide a free copy of this game to everyone.

Nasty Nas	Recommended	21.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/maudderung/	The best puzzle game. Could say one of the best Valve games.
Yapyap	Recommended	63.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/helloprofilestalkerowo/	Portal 2 is an amazing game, and it's obvious the team at Valve have worked hard to deliver a whole new experience better than the first game! The voice actors are great, giving personality to the characters of Portal and Portal 2, and the storyline really catches my attention, making me want to keep on playing and find out more! Portal 2 introduces many new gameplay elements, such as puzzle building and gels, and the co-op mode delivers endless hours of fun! I would recommend Portal 2 to anyone just wanting a great game they can experience countless times without getting bored!
Darkassault	Recommended	21.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/therealdarkassault/	What's not to love about this game? Such a cool storyline, amazing level design, and memorable characters. Not forgetting to mention the crisp soundtrack of the game. Valve, you've outdone yourself with this masterpiece. I know you probably see this kind of review all the time, but I sincerely thank you for creating such a great game.
RunOrShoot?	Recommended	15.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RunOrShoot/	Great game, but still no cakeKudos to the guys at Valve for bettering an original yet again. Portal was a masterly work of originality and ingenuity and PORTAL 2 takes the principles laid down in the first game and develops them even further. The puzzles are even more creative and there’s a much wider variety of environments to work your way through. And these environments are often quite breathtaking to behold, which is in itself impressive given the age of the Source engine. Graphically it’s huge, expansive, and immersive. And then there’s the writing of course. Valve have always been at the head of the pack when it comes to the quality of the writing behind their games and P2 is no exception. The script is sharp, dry, and delivered to perfection by the cast. To top it all there is  now the option to play community-created maps and coop games with others. What more could you want? 5/5
Levi	Recommended	186.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WHGUMR/	 In Short - Portal 2 is one of Valve's most recent titles, and is very well made, I think we can all agree. It is the sequel to the critically aclaimed game 'Portal'. Now, Portal has become so popular that I don't believe I need to explain the game's mechanics; it is such a simple concept and yet has been parodied and explained 100s of times across the Internet. Portal 2 expands on why we all loved Portal, with new mechanics, new story, new characters and new settings. The game keeps it's original mix of difficulty and ease to make a title that you can play in almost every mood. Portal 2 has so much replay-ability, that I've played the game 77 hours; beating the single player campaign three times and the Co-Op campaign twice, gaining every achievement. And not once did I get bored of playing, not once did I think 'this is getting boring', as quite a few games would make you feel after 77 hours.  More In Depth - Portal 2 starts out waking the player up an unknown amount of time since the last game. The announcer even breaks, from saying so many '9's, of time that you've been there. After a fairly slow start, you get thrown into testing almost immedietly. Although I'd like to ignore the story for the sake of the review, it helps keep the flow of the game. The story puts together reasons to add new mechanics, instead of just slapping them in and hoping fans overlook it. The game makes sure to keep its ties to Half-Life in secrets hidden around too, which I find really interesting. Portal 2 does even better than the original game at keeping it puzzle centered. It keeps itself faithful to what Portal built, and made tests that require quick thinking like an action game, as well as thought out and intricate thinking like a puzzle game. Not once does the game hand the player a weapon, which I feel is a good thing. Portal is like Half-Life's puzzle counterpart. You go to HL for action, and Portal for puzzles, which I really like. Singleplayer Portal 2's Singleplayer mode carries on the story from Portal, as I said. We are given a ton of new tests, with new mechanics such as mobility gels, light surfaces, excursion funnels, but keeping Portal's mechanics such as flinging, momentum and turrets, occasionally mixing them together to make a game worth the label 'created by Valve'. Our original only characters, Chell, GLaDOS  and the Companion Cube  are brought back in Portal 2, each as main characters, still, while bringing on a new main character, Wheatly. His character was made very well, with the perfect voice actor for his lines, the perfect lines for his voice actor, a hilarious personality and more. He was even added into Team Fortress 2 as the Ap-Sap (my favourite sapper). All in all, Portal 2's singleplayer is definitely fun to experience. It's something you can sit down and play in the evening and feel relaxed. A mug of tea, a warm blanket, and some puzzles.  Co-Op Now, I think I should probably preface this with a disclaimer; I don't dislike Portal 2's Co-Op. I've played it with three friends, and gotten every achievement for it (thank you Ambiticus, Roger and Sammy for helping me with all the achievements :3)I felt, personally, that Co-Op was very shoved in your face and rushed, unfortunately. After how much I enjoyed Portal, when I bought Portal 2 I was hoping for something very similar; more story, more challenges and more of my favourite characters. And, although there are those things, there could be more if it wasn't for Co-Op. We are given two, barely distinguishable robots with 'personalities' that are really just a couple forced quirks given to them. The puzzle aspect is good, they use the two players to make puzzles impossible without teamwork, and, obviously, four portals, getting you across new distances otherwise impossible with one portal gun. However, this is just brought down by the rest of it. GLaDOS is written completely different to how she usually is. Instead of a passive-agressive AI, she is clearly just agressive, which really makes no sense. One of the best things about GLaDOS is that she is terribly passive-agressive, and for whatever reason, in Co-Op that is all just flung off the table, and instead we have a new GLaDOS; one that is just plain agressive, messing with the robots' friendship by saying different things to eachother, exploding them at the end of each course, and generally just being mean. This doesn't fit her at all, and it makes me almost sad to see how they did this. PROs 'n' CONs PROs -  Both single player and two player gameplay. A level creator, connected to the Steam Workshop, so you can make your own puzzles. Many achievements, to leave an achievement hunter with a lot of work to do. These achievements span across single and multiplayer. Gameplay faithful to the original Portal. Although the above statement is true, they still seamlessly add in new mechanics to enhance the gameplay. A fairly big game. Playing through singleplayer and multiplayer without achievement hunting was probably almost half of my time in this game. Fun, lovable characters, that are easy to get used to.CONs -  Co-Op, although the gameplay is fine, is very rushed in nearly every other aspect. The characters don't have personalities, although Valve obviously meant for them to, GLaDOS isn't normal, there is very little continuity, and- Honestly, I could go on, but a rant isn't what I'm here for. I have to say, honestly, that Portal 2's ending song, Want you Gone, will NEVER be as good as Portal's, Still Alive. I like to have subtitles on, in case I miss a line of dialog, and there were multiple times in which the words and subtitles did not match at all. Words, even sentences would be off. The developer commentary just wasn't that great, compared to Half-Life 2 or Portal. Final words Portal 2 definitely has good and bad aspects. It is a fun game in many ways, yet I believe it just wasn't finished. It had potential, and while most of it was met, it just isn't all there. I'd recommend the game, but I hope that Portal 3, whatever form it takes, will be better. Enjoy this review?

Fruners	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fruners/	I want to make this really clear, Portal 2 is amazing. I am disappointed with the number of people who have complained because A) they think the game is to short and B) they bought DLC obviously selling 'trivial' content and C) they believe the visuals are poor.Before I discuss those two points I want to say why I think this is game is incredible, firstly it succeeds in being a great sequel, it's added loads of new gameplay mechanics to freshen up the puzzles and gameplay and hasn't tainted the original essence of its predecessor. The production values are astounding there are huge set pieces, stunning effects and some of the best voice acting i've ever heard in a game from the cast, particularly Stephen Merchant for his excellent performance as the babbling Wheatley and Ellen McLain returns scary as ever as everyones favourite AI baddy GLADOS.Now to comment on the three main criticisms i've seen. The singleplayer took many hours for me to play (at least 7 hours) and I haven't even touched the cooperative mode either which is sure to take several hours as well. The day 1 dlc is quite obviously not meant to "extend play" and is instead meant for novelty, also you can buy all the dlc in a bundle for about a quarter of the price than if you bought each item separately (if you still bought it and feel cheated then your too stupid to be playing this game). Finally, while the source engine is indeed quite old, even on my PC the game certainly looked impressive and those of you with more powerful computers and the people who will buy the console versions will enjoy the game looking even better.In conclusion, Portal 2 is a must buy, a certain contender for game of the year, the game is smart, clever, well designed and a joy to play and I highly recommend picking it up but please if you haven't already please play the first game because it makes the experience that much better.P.S. The ending is a great one, I can't believe some people didn't like it, It will leave you wanting more is all i'm going to say
cake	Recommended	31.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029381626/	Well, well, well... we are in the presence of a game that exploded with the boundaries of FPS capability.Portal 2 is one, if not the best, bulletless FPS of all time.Mindblowing and addictive puzzles will keep you until the very end.10/10 - "Great work! Because this message is prerecorded, any observations related to your performance are speculation on our part. Please disregard any undeserved compliments."Aperture Science's sasha is out, peace.
James Mackey	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078093020/	I can describe this game in one sentence "squeeze your brain to solve puzzle" and that's really cool about this game,  Portal 2 is a great first person puzzle platform that I've ever played  I really recommend it 
ETERNAL	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SwivellSteamPage/	Greatest puzzle game of all time.

PessiMystic	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zerosuitq/	A brain damaged girl finds new and interesting ways to experiment with her two holes, but the artificial intelligence lady tries to stop her again and there's a third party involved this time. Drama ensues.
Yung Pup	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/coolassassin241/	Portal 2 is by all means a perfect game. The single player is a fun adventure that won't take too long, the two actors for Wheatley and Glados are great and entertain the whole game. The puzzles are interesting and not too difficult some will test you but you can always get through them. The multiplayer is incredibly fun and I honestly wish Valve would make a full multiplayer Portal game (we need Portal 3 first). All in all a perfect game.
SloppySteve	Recommended	2,589.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205069559/	Portal is the best game out there.  Unlimited ways to make puzzles.  I do wish that Valve would offer a better PTI editor.
ParanoidPaul	Recommended	23.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987175590/	What I liked about the game Funny and entertaining characters; like Cave Johnson, Wheatley and Glados. New items added into the puzzles.   Plenty of mysterious things to find throughout the game; like Rat man hideouts. Portal 2 is twice as long, with plenty of areas to explore. I really liked exploring the old part of Aperture. Puzzles get gradually harder, and things change a little when you're in the old part of Aperture.Steam achievements and extra content. Interesting story that takes unexpected turns. What I disliked or was disappointed with Still too short. Wasn't as keen on the soundtrack this time round. Conclusion Outstanding game; Value managed to pull it off again. Everything I loved about the first game is still there. If you liked the first portal game then I highly recommend you buy this. 94/100 
major	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198243340100/	Finished the game after playing it for 12 hours and I should say Portal 2 is one of the best games ever made in history.Well-written story,good musics and awesome gameplay :,)Will miss GlaDOS tho Highly recommend!10/10
Kirby	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198319818104/	Portal 2 is the sequel to Portal and adds more puzzles and more fun.At the beginning of Portal 2, Chell is awakened in a “long-term relaxation chamber” in Aperature Science by a little hilarious, British personality named Wheatley. Wheatley's goal is to help you escape, however you soon find out that GLaDOS is still alive. Chell is once again forced to use her portal gun to navigate the ruins of the facility and deal with the resurrected GLaDOS. The story takes some very interesting twists and turns along the way and the terrific dark humor of the first game remains intact.The gameplay from the original game returns in all of its mind-bending glory. Players use the portal gun to shoot blue and orange colored portal holes onto walls to traverse over deadly pits, transport Weighted Storage Cubes to switches to open doors and lower elevators and redirect lasers. Additions to the gameplay include the propulsion and repulsion gels which do pretty much as they describe, either sliding the player off at great speed or sending them bouncing high into the air. In addition, players must redirect light bridges and conveyer beams with portals as well.One of the most exciting new features in Portal 2 is the inclusion of co-op gameplay.Co-op gameplay gets its own storyline and characters, Aperture Science robots ATLAS and P-Body, each armed with their own portal gun and even more challenging puzzles for the gamers to solve. You can either play with a friend (split-screen or online) or team up with a random player.I highly recommend Portal 2 to anyone who is looking for a good fun game that will take up a few hours and even make you think instead of the average First Person Shooter. Overall, Portal 2 is a masterpiece and definitely worth the money.Sounds 10/10Graphics 10/10Gameplay 10/10Atmosphere 10/10

All game on logic and mind. In single game I liked a plot, it well continues a plot of the first part. And in a multiplayer well develops in itself a team game, and it is so possible to have fun simply with the friend (Bubble_Gum [RUSская]) approves)))). I recommend to all, won't regret! ! !

Lunaril	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/	Portal 2 takes place in the distant future, after the events of Portal, and was released in 2011. Like the original Portal, Portal 2 is a First Person Puzzle game created by Valve. Again  you play as Chell, the survivor of Portal, who must once again use Aperture technology to escape. With the help of Wheatley, a personality bot, you have to overcome various obstacles in an attempt to escape through the delapitated testing chambers.  Portal 2 has a more indepth storyline than the original, and gives a little back story into Aperture Science and it's founder; Additionally, aside from Single player mode, Portal 2 also has a cooperative campaign mode. Portal 2 is as much of a fun puzzle game as the original, so if you enjoyed Portal, you should buy Portal 2, because it has better challenges and more story.
Kureiji Daiyamondo	Recommended	38.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RealestNat/	My co-op partner and I taunted GLaDOS in front of the cameras, she got mad, and we were rewarded with an achievement.

|254|CaptainLulz|	Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainLulz/	Welcome to the Portal 2 store page. You are about to purchase one of the most the best games that has, and probably will be made. Yes, the game is that good. Why, you ask? Well;The story is well written and feels solid.  The pacing is perfect and manages to balance that fine line between delivering a consistently pleasing experience to you as the player but without leaving you feeling pressured or overloaded. The puzzles are challenging, but not mind-numbingly so; you will likely not be destroying your expensive hardware out of frustration at least.  The graphics are quite good and even though the game will be turning four years a few month's from now, Portal 2 is testament that Valve's source engine (which itself is growing quite long in the tooth) is still a force to be reckoned with. The sound design in this game, from the AI's comments to the  environmental sounds manage to create an atmosphere that feels truly amazing.And Finally, what makes Portal 2... 'PORTAL 2!'  the enigma known  as GLaDOS. There really is nothing that could be said about this entity that hasn't been already; except for the simple fact that GLaDOS is a lot more human than AI. It's uncanny. And also, depending on how much you've heard/read about the game, creepy. And sad. Damn.The only real downside to Portal 2 is that given Valve's history with the number 3, another masterpiece like this is unlikely to happen in the near future. It's a shame really.Would I recommend this game to anyone? No. I would recommend it to everyone.

Shields	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043216746/	There is no game like this one. Portal 2 manages to soar far above the original Portal and add yet another level of intricate artistic enrichment and dazzling gameplay. I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be allowed to play this game because it is so fun, and should go back to playing other games that get dwarfed in comparison to this one.When a novel gives me a strong emotional response to its contents, I applaud it for being superior to many others. When a game does this, I know I'm playing Portal 2. Some of the dialogue is the funniest I've ever heard; some of it deeply bothers me and drives me, in true anger and passion, to beat the game and prove myself... to a character in a video game. I actually feel like I am the main character in this game. At the very least, I empathize with them 100%.And the gameplay... like I said, there is nothing like it. Riding the learning curve of Portal 2 and realizing that no, some of the levels really aren't impossible, are incredible experiences. The achievement and satisfaction of solving a difficult and very intellectual 3-D puzzle feels wonderful.You may have heard people speak well of this game, and I'd like to speak greatly of it. But if all that hasn't convinced you to get it, then maybe this will: it's just fun. It's an FPS with no gun, a purely intellectual flourish of discovery, mystery, immersive gameplay, and, if you stay with it, the greatest victories you can find on Steam. Please get Portal 2 (after you get Portal). Please do it. I would be happy for anyone that decided to pick up and play Portal 2, because I would be absolutly confident that they will have as much fun in it as I did.

BrushBristle	Recommended	25.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101484818/	Portal 2 is the amazingly imersive and fun sequel to the amazingly imersive and fun videogame known as portal. It isn't however one of those sequels where they give you the same product with prettier graphics and do nothing to improve on it; the game contains many great new innovations. At its core, portal is a puzzle platformer game, and this aspect is combined with the story in a way that forces you to think of outside-the-box solutions. The characters are all compelling; even the silent protagonist gets some characterization during the game. She's smart, good at jumping, and is able to jump over both emotional and physical obstacles with ease. When things get tough, and she has a murderous AI tryng to kill her at every turn, she just keeps testing.The game has essentially three modes. There's the story, co-op, and community made maps. The community for this game  is amazing. They take all the resources Valve has lent them, and they make games barely recognizable as part of portal. It could also go in the opposite direction, and you get a game that feels like it should be a part of the main story. One major downside is that you cann't play co-op, or in  community maps, if you lack an internet connection. There are many great maps that make you think and analyze the tools you're given in different ways; It's a shame that you can't just download and play one of them while on the go. If you're not into puzzle platforming, in-depth and imersive storytelling doesn't impress you, and you don't like any of your friends enough to play this with them without committing murder, this isn't the game for you.10/10

Daddy Davey	Recommended	46.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DigitalDavid/	Love replaying this every once in a while. Never gets old, and well worth the time. Still waiting for the third. 
Hideo	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hideo_suzuki/	Throughout the single-player campaign I was constantly surprised how clever you could use this "simple" formula of two portals, and I admit, I had to look one or two times in a walkthrough - still, it's manageable for others like me who don't solve puzzles often and I really liked the feeling of accompishment after solving a puzzle and the reward of getting a new piece of the story (told in an unusually silly and amusing way; "lemonades").And the coop-campaign: I don't know any other game where you solve puzzles this way. Really, it's a lot of fun and shouldn't be missed out either (if you have someone to play with). It was also one of the first games on Steam with Splitscreen support. Although it's made only for two players only, I'm pretty sure that it also would be funny with three or four people locally, when everyone's trying to figure a puzzle out together and the gamepads get handed around.Lastly, there's the Workshop integration, and boy oh boy, are there a lot of puzzles. There are very complex ones with custom terrain and more simpler ones, created with the later released simpler editor, and there's an endless supply of new ones. I acctually recommend trying the simpler editor out yourself, just to see how hard it is to come up with puzzles.Anyways, this is a game that everyone should play, even if it's not your genre. Because this is one of those defining games others will draw inspirations from and have to be measured by for years to come.

Falem	Recommended	126.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/falem123/	The single player did something I thought i would have never witness. It made the robots feel utterly alive and deep with emotional expressions. It is at least a 5 hour speedrun from what I have heard but a very great ride indeed.For those who enjoyed Portal 1 and are afraid that this game isn't that much of a improvement. Fear not for this game delievers tons of new elements within their puzzles. Like gravity rays and cubes that reflect lazors. Along with tons of other neat additions. The co-op in this game takes place after you beat the game in single player. Which is well thought out and creative addition to the game. That makes partners relay on each other in order to reach their goal. Overall I would say Portal 2 did something that is not really done well before. Made creative and innovative designs to their game which allow partners relay on each other to navigate through the maps and the story itself.

Dead Man	Recommended	66.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/profileofdeadman/	This is one of the best games I have played.

It is understandable how some people may not like the game, as there is simply nothing around of it's kind and it may seem somewhat alien, but I implore you to give this game a chance and put the shooters down for a while and enjoy what Valve has come up with here. It's hard to explain what the game entails until you've tried it, so I won't try other than to say it's a puzzle solver.As Chell you will find yourself revisiting Aperture whilst discovering much about it's past, no narrative is required here, through brilliant scripting you will find out the answer to most questions you asked yourself in Portal as you go. Glados is back, as acerbic as ever and she is joined by Steven Marchant's excellent Wheatley, Cave Johnson rounds up a superb trio of main characters who will have you laughing like you never have before at a game whilst wondering how you can fall in love with faceless characters in a videogame.Some people have remarked that Portal 2 is somewhat short. But, if you combine the solo and co-op campaigns then you have more than your moneys worth here.

Evil and Muse Gaming	Recommended	19.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilandMuse/	Portal 2 is a first person puzzle game. This review is based off of a Local Coop experience. Playing this game was an amazing experience. This game requires focus and brains, lol. You're supposed to use portals, cubes, and other objects to solve puzzles that can be really simple or really hard. And yo, it can get really hard (at least for us lol). There was a puzzle that took us 1 hour. And guess what we did after that hour.. (YUP! We gave up). Only for us to come back to it a day later and see it was never hard to begin with. Completing these type of levels give you a great sense of accomplishment, but also reminds you that teamwork is key. This game also has its funny moments. Like, when I used the cube laser reflection to kill Muse (which leads to the point being another amazing part of this game is the no punishment. So killing her with no penalty was fun). Another thing I found great with this game was the narrative. It was very funny and was perfectly written. It had us dying of laugher often. Added to every thing I just said, this game also has a steam workshop. Meaning when you finish the game you have a large number of coop levels to download from the workshop. We would definitely give this game a recommend.You can watch us play this game in the link below:https://youtu.be/II6cs3sAH6g

BaRa 95.	Recommended	713.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/unknowngirl15/	This is my first review so please don't judge me if I fail to follow the form. Few years ago my brother and I played this game. When he saw it on winter holiday sale he "made me" buy it for both of us.I finished single player first and I just love quotes, both Wheatley's and GladOS's. Single player felt longer then first game's and that sudden fall and change of surrounding is great. Cherry on cake is credit song which I only saw on Portal games and  make these games so special.I also like fun that doing these achievements brings, from throwing yourself into pit to breaking screens that results with some funny Wheatley's quotes.I think many people will agree with me when I say that co op is equaly good but even more fun the single player.That is the element of game that I spent most of my in-game time on. Playing standard co op levels seperated into 5 groups of courses (not counting bonus courses) is great way to first learn game basics (in case you didn't play single player) but also to realize how good is your partner (how good reflexes he/she has, how much time is he/she willing to spend thinking, is he/she too stubborn to be played with, can you two understand eachother and how good host he/she is). I can say I played with at least 10 different partners I met online and finding few that I really enjoy playing with was not easy task.I also love the fact it has option to design your own test chamber and publish it on Steam Workshop pretty easily. Thanks to that you can, while in game, browse for the test chamber that is on your level (to be honest probably everyone after playing standard co op or/and single player for few times gets better on understanding game rules so he/she can solve harder tests more easily), subscribe and play it. There are whole collections of tests, some even with custom graphics and voices used to tell you original story through testing. You can choose from racing test to very complex one that require thinking. Playing this game you can very easily catch yourself asking how did time pass by so quickly. One of my co op partners and I spent over and hour playing just one test, but I don't regret a second because it was so much fun :).I am going to finish this with conclusion that this game connects different people which all have one thing in common- they are ready to do some testing :)I really hope I didn't fail form and this review helped someone decide to buy this game and be satisfied with it like I am.

NetherNub	Recommended	82.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076460212/	This game deserves a super long and detailed review, ratings from the best pages and a list of all the awards it's won. But I guess simple and sweet works as well. My old review was -''Played the first one or not... Portal 2 is an amazing game!... Worth it...Every penny!It has a real complex and well thought of story line.Loved playing every second of it..Its a must buy!''and I must say, It's simple and sweet and honest as anything. This game will always have a place in my heart, ALWAYS. If only Valve could count to 3! :c ... But then again I'm not sure if a third is actually needed! Portal and Portal 2 are amazing, they truely are. Please, just play it <3 ''When life gives you lemons, don't make lemonade make life!...''

p0rtalthumper	Recommended	2,769.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/p0rtalmaster/	I could play the various tests again, and again, forever.  You know, if you recommend such a game to someone else they might devote their existence to creating science.  Aperture Science.  From scratch!Oh GLaDOS (and other personality constructs), how you inspire me...What drew me into this game is that this is no real shooter.  In fact, turrets and bombs are the only combat elements in this game.  Your goal: to escape to the surface, i.e. to think your way out of all those tests in the hope that someday the system will let you go.A masterpiece:Puzzles: 10/10.  Workshop items vary, but the core puzzles (Over 60 of them for Single player and co-op modes) are well-made.  Not so hard that you feel like giving up, but not so easy that you feel like you did nothing.  At some point in the game, you'll have to "test on your own recognizance," with almost no visual hints, but by then you should be well-trained in the "science" of Thinking With Portals.Art: 10/10.  On some of the new testing elements, the blue/orange theme is kept.  Additionally, the various test chamber themes seen as the story progresses are memorable.  Fairly visceral, but not to the point where it distracts from the puzzle solving.Sound: 10/10.  The music is incredible, as are the ambient sound/scapes.Storyline: 8/10, although I must say that the behind-the-scenes stuff for Aperture Science is very impressive!Dialog: 10/10.  Memorable lines by all the characters, with humor to match....Physics: 9/10.  You can't be 100% perfect when portals are involved (visually and otherwise), but the algorithms are much improved from the original.Commentary: 9/10.  I miss hearing Ellen McLain's voice when she wasn't GLaDOS (a similar thing goes for all the other voice actors).  Other than that, the developers have truly insightful stuff!Other details depend on what system you're running, as well as the settings you have.And finally, this awesome game as an awesome in-game editor, in addition to being a Source Engine game, so you can create your own puzzles.  Be sure to check out the Portal 2 Authoring Tools (not for the faint of mind, though).Recommended gameplay (but I recommend playing the original Portal first): Start with Single-player mode.  Then move on to co-op and the developer commentary (for continuity of the story line).  Finally, when you feel tired of the 112 standard maps contained within the game, take a look into the workshop, where you'll find hundreds and hundreds of tests.Overall rating, with some generous rounding: 10/10.  These are also the same odds that you should enjoy this game.Update for Thanksgiving 2016: get nominated for the Test of Time award.  5 years and counting and this game is still one of the best games in the history of great games.
Tmast98	Recommended	578.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tmast98/	Portal 2 is one of my all time favorite games.  This game had both amazing game design and artistic design, somthing I rarely see.

ᴅrey	Recommended	933.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DreeyBR/	Valve changed the puzzle games genre... againPortal 2 gets the absolute best of Portal and expands it in ways no one thought would be possible. It's not a game you forget after you've beaten it.It's the best narrative in modern video games with brilliantly written dialogues, memorable characters and quotes, and some of the best voice acting ever. The story is rich and deep, done the Valve way of show don't tell.The puzzles are satisfying to solve and well made, with amazing level design and unique visuals that make every puzzle not only a monotonous black and white room but a great space in an unknown, abandoned facility.The music will relax you, make you alert, sweat, shake and then repeat. It will react to your actions, help you solve the puzzles in very subtle ways, and it's available for free if you buy the game. It's greatly implemented and vastly present in all game. The co-op is even more fun and satisfying, adding another layer of puzzle solving to your game. The workshop has hundreds of thousands of user created content that offers countless hours of extra gameplay.You can grab this game for a penny or two during sales, so there's no excuse not to have it in your Steam library yet.Portal 2 is perfect. It's a masterpiece and I'm proud to say it's the best game I've ever played.

Rezalon	Recommended	68.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rezalon/	This review assumes you already own and have completed the first Portal, my review of which can be read here.Game: Portal 2Developer and publisher: Valve SoftwareReleased: 19 April, 2011Genre: First-Person Puzzler with ComedySetting: "At least 50,000 years" after Portal 1, Aperture Science Enrichment Centre, Upper Michigan, U.S.A., EarthSpoiler-free plot summary: After the events of the Portal 1, you, Chell, find yourself awakening in the mysterious science facility once again. However, at least 50,000 years have passed since you were last conscious, and the facility is now in ruins. Your only hope of escaping it once and for all is to put all of your faith in one of the incompetent robots built to maintain the facility, Wheatley, who also wants to escape.Full review: Portal 2 is a far superior game than its predecessor. Being a fully fledged game with a unique story, unique humour, new game mechanics, and new environments, Portal 2 makes Portal 1 look like a tech demo.Portal 2 can take several hours to complete; not just because the game is longer in general, but because the tests are far more varied than Portal 1's, and require longer thought and planning. There are several new mechanics introduced in Portal 2, such as the Thermal Discouragement Beam which replaces the High Energy Pellet seen in Portal 1, but shares the same basic concept of directing the projectile into its respective "catcher", and Mobility Gels which can either make you jump higher or run faster. When all mixed together, these can make several of the later test chambers far more difficult than the previous ones, which means having to think outside the box (sometimes almost literally). At first, these chambers might seem too hard or impossible to complete, but once you've worked out the solution, the "Aaaaah!" moment makes the struggle (and perhaps frustration) very much worth it.Unlike Portal 1, Portal 2 doesn't have any advanced or challenge map packs; instead, Portal 2 has a challenge mode, which is a combination of the least portals created and least time taken challenges in the Portal 1 challenge map pack. Also, instead of having just six chambers to be challenged on, you have every single chamber in the main campaign to be challenged on! An online leaderboard is also included in this game mode for those who want to compete with friends.A new game mode introduced in Portal 2 is the map maker. In a parallel universe, founder and CEO of Aperture Science, Cave Johnson, has developed a multiverse device which can send test subjects into other parallel universes, who can test, and steal, that parallel universe's test chambers. These test chambers are the player-made ones you can download and play from the Steam Workshop. With the right know-how, you can make your own test chambers and upload them onto the Workshop for others to download and play.Another new game mode introduced is the co-op campaign. Set a few weeks after the events of the single-player campaign, two robots GLaDOS has created (you and a buddy) are tasked with solving tests which are used to train you for upcoming missions GLaDOS has planned. This game mode also includes its own online leaderboard and can also have maps made and uploaded to the Steam Workshop.As said before, the story and humour of Portal 2 are unique. There are several twists that make you sit on the edge of your seat, and the humour, being incredibly dark, can make you laugh your♥♥♥♥♥off, and make you feel uneasy, or even guilty about it. There are several new environments introduced that weren't seen in Portal 1, such as the behind-the-scenes areas of the test chambers, and the ruins of 20th Century Aperture. And although there is less of a mystery aspect to Portal 2 compared to Portal 1, those with a good eye (and ears) can still find some things you'd find out-of-place, even in Aperture Science.This game is, no doubt, one of the best games ever made. Do I recommend buying Portal 2? Of course I do! Especially if you like puzzles, or humour, or video-games, or not breathing neurotoxin. For NZD$23.99, I'd wait for a sale for when this game is $17 - $20 before buying it.

Everything has been destroyed and there are new gameplay mechanics. You still have the same portal gun though. In all its a fun 3D platformer that feels very familiar. Not much to say really. Pick it up for $5 where you can.

Well Team fortress 2 or Day of Defeat or Counter strike or left 4 dead were super awesome too but i mostly enjoyed in Portal 2 and Half life series and i really hope, REALLY HOPE to see Part 3 of Portal and half life and i really appreciate the hard work in these games from valve and i just wanna say, Keep up the great work guys and don't stop because if you really didn't try to create Part 3 of Half life or Portal or maybe Left 4 dead so it gonna be kinda sad but anyway you still the best and you will always be the best like the other great companies but really don't stop working in Half life 3 or Portal 3 and i hope you working on them btw.

Izudeku	Recommended	80.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MSRPKen/	This game, like others I've played and enjoyed, thoroughly execute a weirdly-strewn-together story that just makes sense once you implement the later parts of the game (before re-arriving at the top of the center). The boss battle was a bit more dissapointing than I'd like to anticipate, but I appreciated it nonetheless, and it's earlier stages before the boss foreshadowed the ending boss battle.
44lyon the foo fighter	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lyonprofile/	The game forces you to think outside the box. I garuntee you will want to keep playing when you finish, and I reccomend to play co-op with someone who hasn't played it before so you can learn everything together.10/10

professor was	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tylfen/	It's freakin amazing! An awesome sequel for portal 1 that came out in the orange box at 2007, amazing story and amazing puzzles.
Flint	Recommended	118.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198194984611/	Probably my favorite game by Valve... *cough, cough make Portal 3 cough, cough* Sorry, I have a bad cough. Asbestos these days...
Don't let your dreams be dreams	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/659875412/	In a way this game want to teach you something...the cruelty of the humans? the corruption of the power? the importance of the cooperation? the devastating effects due to the abuse of the experimentation? And so on...play to find your point of view about it....But back to business!This game is really really really cool! Based on interactive puzzles this game will make your hours flying away like an airplane directed to the other side of the planet.As the name suggest you have to use portals to move yourself from a point to another, or redirect laser beams, or to move objects...or to throw them....or even to throw yourself!The gameplay is fun, but it will easily put a sad face on you in some parts...and vice versa. The co-op mode is indeed the best one I've ever seen. In this game the co-op mode is FINALLY a true co-op mode (and I will say "co-op mode" another time just because I like to say "co-op mode" today). If you don't talk with your partner, if you don't plan to do stuff at the right time, if you go ahead alone....forget this game...is not for you; if you don't cooperate you will be unable to pass the first co-op level.The fact that this game is even multiplatform compatible means that you can even play it with friend that have this game on PS3. This is a very interesting and good thing.The graphic is indeed good, mostly based on HL2 engine (well...is a Valve game...lol) and the sounds are pretty nice too (funny the music based/created on the laser beams or in other puzzles you have to solve); and the support of the contoller will put a smile on the console's enthusiast.The story is related to the first portal and as I said in the beginning the single player mode is more deeper than a simple game; a very good observer and listener will easy understand what this game wants to tell you...probably in its own way but still it is a message.Overall:Graphics 8/10Sounds 8/10Gameplay 9/10Co-Op Gameplay 10/10Longevity 9/10

Sneaky EmA	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Snk_EmA/	Oh boy, Portal 2. A modern classic.Very solid gameplay, not that much long in Singleplayer.Has a Co-op mod which can be finished between 2 and... 5 hours, depending how much dumb you and your.. companion is.The workshop keeps this game very much alive, from single levels to co-op maps & semi total conversion mods.7 years later and still going strong!
Ranseurs	Recommended	10.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ranseurs/	Well done Valve... Sequel from Portal will give you more amazing experience about physics and logic by using red and blue portal. Many improvements were made in this sequel.+Gameplay still same, just find the way out by using your portal. But the setting, level design, and other components make this gameplay is more awesome than the prequel.+The story is great. Potato will be a part of the stories too (play if you want to know what i mean).+The graphic is still great for a puzzle game.Every levels from this game need your brains to solve it. So if you don't have any brains, don't play it.I really recommend this game: 9/10

ElectricDragon	Recommended	511.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/electricdragonj/	Portal 2 is an amazing follow up to the original. It’s campaign does focus more on the lore and characters, but that isn’t a bad thing in my opinion. There is plenty of testing to be done. Between the cleverly designed co-op or the incredible maps the hammer community creates you shouldn’t run out of anything to do anytime soon. Well worth the price and all the hours of fun it has given me on Steam.
Happy Tanksgiving	Recommended	228.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079391625/	I've looked for games like Portal 2 on steam but have never found one. The puzzles are fun and challenging. The story mode is entertaining with lots of humor, and there is fantastic single player and coop content in the workshop. Plus, the graphics are beautiful. I love this game.

Sus 🦋	Recommended	37.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/susensd/	I think, that the fact that I bought this game on Steam AFTER completing it several times on my Playstation, says a lot about how amazing this game is.... I'd go as far as to say that this is one of those historical classics that one simply don't have any valid arguments for not playing.
󰀍 loopuleasa 󰀍	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/loopuleasa/	This will be forever a classic in the gaming world.Great puzzle. Great personality. Great story.And the steam workshop makes it all complete
Craxzy $	Recommended	2.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/craxzy/	This game is excellent indeed, if you enjoyed the first Portal then you must enjoy this sequel, it has more thinking with portals and more features than ever before. However I took away a mark for this game, as I finished it without rushing in approximately 2 hours and 34 minutes playing time, this does not include the co-op part of the game or any possible advanced chambers, just the singleplayer. The co-op feature is excellent and will also take you several more hours of gameplay and fun. The graphics are beautiful, no need for them to be improved as they do the best job possible and the game performs perfectly on the PC thanks to the great source engine.This is a must buy for most gamers out there.

🐾Huskeeh🐾	Recommended	12.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FalconPwnz/	Portal 2 isn't just a sequel to a physics-based puzzle game, it is the triumphant return to Aperture Science; what lacked the first Portal was a stronger narrative, Valve fixed this issue and delivered a story driven puzzle game, adding new elements to the award winning formula made back in 2007, a better soundtrack, highly improved graphics and varied testing chambers. Although the game may seem short, it will still be one of the best times you will have in your life.+Portal gun strikes again+Improved graphics+Amazing narrative +Attractive soundtrack+New testing elements+Fun Co-op98/100 Masterpiece

Sam Squirrely 🖤	Recommended	33.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SamSquirrely/	I love this game. It's very addicting and it's just great. I recommend this game because it's fun to just make portals and get your mind in the right place.
Magnitude	Recommended	20.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chitalian/	I can't remember the last time I've felt so satisfied playing a game. Portal 2's writing is immaculate and hilarious, and it is a joy to solve the game's varied puzzles while listening to three of gaming's best-written characters speak. The puzzles themselves are not impossible by any means, but hard enough to make you think for a good deal. The best part about Portal 2 is that it makes the player feel so rewarded when they reach that "Aha!" moment of solving a puzzle, and it does this countless times in so many different ways.

Graham Crackers	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexIsBadAtGames/	I played both Portal games for the first time this year, and I finally get why they’re held in such high regard. It’s not shooting portals, or Glados singing in the credits, or 2011 memes. It’s about building an entire world around what is essentially a girl doing science experiments with a robot. But I will admit that, looking back, Portal 1 felt like an extended tech demo to me. Right when I thought it was getting good, it was over.Portal 2, on the other hand, is much more unique and fleshed-out. You got Wheatly and Cave Johnson coming in as the most memorable, well-acted characters in forever, you got that dry, sarcastic humor that Valve is famous for, and you got the Enrichment Center chapter which is still my favorite part of both Portal games, period. It’s a classic for good reason.5/5 
NaturalUnovan	Recommended	9.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083954842/	With an intriguing story line, great voice acting followed through with fun, innotative puzzles, Portal 2 is certainly amongst my favourite games of all time. Given to me as a christmas present, i've been playing non stop ever since. I highly recommend investing your money into this wonderful creation. If you haven't played the original, not to worry, nor have I, the story line is easy and fun to catch on especially as the game is filled with dark humour causing you to learn more about the main character's past. Also the story actually delves into the history of "Aperture Science" so if you want a fun game to keep you entertained, this is the game to purchase. Thank you to my friend who bought it for me!!!!
TheLightningThief	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thelightningthief/	Portal 2 puts your brain to exercise and is an extremely fun game to play. Not many people play Portal 2 nowadays so finding a multiplayer match might be hard. I like the game a lot!
Counterclockwork	Recommended	17.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Counterclockwork/	A great game, I'm glad I bought. Anticipated it on an unhealthy level when it first was released and played it over 2 years ago, and even playing it again I still laugh and enjoy it. After playing back 2, I tried Portal 1 again and you immediately notice the imense increase in quality of the game, sounds, and images. Comedy and puzzles. Who knew they worked so well together.
Ularech	Recommended	193.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/doobob/	One of the most innovative games ever made. Has a great story with a rich background to it and the Puzzles are the most clever ones I have ever. A must buy for your steam library

Globku	Recommended	24.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/globku/	Definitly one of the best games of 2011.If you're not familiar with the game, it is a puzzle game, played in a first person perspective, where you use portals to solve the puzzles, while immersed in a storyline with some of the best voice acting I've ever seen.Absolutly recomended if you like puzzle games, and dark sarcastic humour.

I recommend anyone to get this If you have a thinking brain or just want to challenge yourself. To be truthful, I do wait a couple months then play the campaign again so I partially forget what to do :P. I do slightly prefer if the underground was more obvious on what to do. Other than that, Wonderful!

Menphues (Kyle)	Recommended	62.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Menphues/	Awesome game!  Beats the hell into the original.  More fun as a Co-op but needs more co-op chambers, which is a let down because there isn't that much at the moment.  Amazing game thow!Graphics: The graphics are actually pretty cool to look at and it makes a change from a Valve game, when all their games are the same graphics across the board... Talk about copy paste... Hear they are improved upon.Audio: The audio is amusing, delightful and fun to listen too from running to talking to the bots communicating or even the game dialogue.Controls:The controls are super easy to use and get used too, nothing special or hard to grasp.Game: The game is a massive step forward from the original Portal because now you have coop and a singleplayer campaign.. Both two different set of chambers to enjoy and that is amazing.... You can do the campaign which has it's own missions to solve and then do coop with a friend which is a totally different back story to the game and the game is so much fun with some amazing amusing moments from the cast of the game.The only sad thing is there is not many official chambers to do and once done, they are done and you must rely on the workshop to have more fun....Would I recommend the game? Yes without a doubt.
Scorpidoo	Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Scorpidoo/	FPS, but you “shoot” with portals.This game got the “Villain Most in Need of a Hug” and it so deserves it!Great voiceovers keeps you really into the game, had already some great laughs on my way, bet there are even more is to come! :)I got this game for a huge discount, got it for 3,99€. For that amount you should also get it you won’t be disappointed!

Stermat	Recommended	233.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Stermat/	.
Orpheus	Recommended	57.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wenoyes/	This is my favourite game. It has an insanely good story, characters, narration and atmosphere. It has new puzzle elements. It's also longer than the first game, but it doesn't overstay it's welcome.If the length of the single player campaign is still unsatisfactory there's also a co-op campaign for two players, which is lots of fun. And if that wasn't enough you get the fortune of community made puzzles for singleplayer and co-op made in the game's easy to use level designer. Start thinking with portals.
Persus	Recommended	43.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PedroPersus/	Portal 2 offers hours upon hours of fun. The singleplayer story lasts around 8-11 hours, and it is awesome. When it was over I actually felt lonely cause even though every character (except yourself) in that game gets angry at you for a good part of the game, when its over you miss them which in my opinion is a good thing. Singleplayer 10/10 The co-op mode is quite fun with a friend (not really fun with strangers), but it is not as good as the story mode. It offers new puzzles and somewhat of a story but besides that it is pretty dull.Co-op 9/10Even when you finish the default story and co-op maps workshop is available for you to get more maps made from the community and new ones are always getting made which means in a way the game never ends. I've played a few of them and they are a lot of fun. Some with cool techniques and others with weird physics (turning you upside down)... And you can also make your own maps very easily ingame.I recommend this game for fun times.Overall 10/10

Human Dog	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198173896053/	Really good classic puzzle game with an awesome story.

HUNcamper	Recommended	35.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/huncamper/	I really recommend this game, because it's not about shooting everything, it's about your brain. That how you can think. It's not just a normal puzzle game, but a really exicting one. Most of the people say that this game sucks because there are only one weapon and you can't even kill anyone... It's not always about killing everybody, but thinking.
Odar	Recommended	44.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OdarGM/	Amazing game!Amazing story and coop missions i realy like to play this game with my friends or any random online guy everyone here is friendly I recommend this game
NaturalUnovan	Recommended	9.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083954842/	With an intriguing story line, great voice acting followed through with fun, innotative puzzles, Portal 2 is certainly amongst my favourite games of all time. Given to me as a christmas present, i've been playing non stop ever since. I highly recommend investing your money into this wonderful creation. If you haven't played the original, not to worry, nor have I, the story line is easy and fun to catch on especially as the game is filled with dark humour causing you to learn more about the main character's past. Also the story actually delves into the history of "Aperture Science" so if you want a fun game to keep you entertained, this is the game to purchase. Thank you to my friend who bought it for me!!!!

Graham Crackers	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlexIsBadAtGames/	I played both Portal games for the first time this year, and I finally get why they’re held in such high regard. It’s not shooting portals, or Glados singing in the credits, or 2011 memes. It’s about building an entire world around what is essentially a girl doing science experiments with a robot. But I will admit that, looking back, Portal 1 felt like an extended tech demo to me. Right when I thought it was getting good, it was over.Portal 2, on the other hand, is much more unique and fleshed-out. You got Wheatly and Cave Johnson coming in as the most memorable, well-acted characters in forever, you got that dry, sarcastic humor that Valve is famous for, and you got the Enrichment Center chapter which is still my favorite part of both Portal games, period. It’s a classic for good reason.5/5 
Papa Løngsteppy	Recommended	143.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112327607/	One of the coolest games I've ever played! Valve did a good job and is very popular.

Anticipated it on an unhealthy level when it first was released and played it over 2 years ago, and even playing it again I still laugh and enjoy it. After playing back 2, I tried Portal 1 again and you immediately notice the imense increase in quality of the game, sounds, and images. Comedy and puzzles. Who knew they worked so well together.

Atratzu	Recommended	54.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/	-Quick Review-Portal2 is a first person puzzle game developed by Valve and released 2011. This game was greatly anticipated when it was announced and we all waited in anticipation for the release.The game was not a disappointment, the developers brought us back to Aperture Laboratories and put us to work on new and innovative puzzles, Portal1 and 2 will always be one of my most favorite puzzle games, period.-Detailed breakdown review-Story: You wake up in a strange hotel-looking room, after awakening you discover you're actually still inside Aperture Laboratories and the whole place is falling apart! You need to find a way out and escape before the whole lab falls down around your ears!Gameplay: The whole game is based on the core concepts of two portals (an Orange/red and Blue Portal), be it moving objects through these portals, moving yourself between these portals, or jumping off high objects to reach hard to reach places, the game is a brainteaser in such a wonderful way. As the catchphrase goes “prepare to think with portals”.There are a number of features in Portal2, there are Single player, Co-op, Community Test Chambers/Workshop, Steam Achievements, and challenge modes where you can compete against your friends for fastest times, least portals used, steps, and more. Achievements: There are 51 Achievements for Portal2, Most of the single player achievements are straightforward fun and challenging to get... There are also Co-op achievements, so it would be best to make or get a friend to help you out.Price: Portal2 is priced at $19.99 that will be the best 20 dollars you spend. But if you're on a tight budget like me you might want to wait for a 75% off sale, since the game was released in 2011 there's a very good chance that there will be sale for it.Conclusion: I really can't sum up how great Portal2 is without saying “look, if you're even remotely interested in trying it out, you don't grasp just what an outstanding puzzle game it is. I highly recommend Portal2 to everyone and anyone.------Edits and updates------Edit/Update September 13, 2015:Here's the URL to see my review for  Portal

Okay, I'll help you.Do you like puzzle games?Yes: Buy Portal 2.No: Buy Portal 2.Oh.. you came becouse of an actual, useful review? Okay then...PLUSes+ Very good, somewhat gripping and super enjoyable story. Insane and unpredictable Plot Twists.+ Cooperation mode!+ Good graphics.

MasterMillz	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198800731716/	Absolutely fantastic. One of the best strategy story based puzzle solving games worldwide. I love it and it's a graet sequel to the previous game. It adds funny characters and has a great plot twist mid way. GLaDOS comes back and you're introduced to wheatley. It's stunning and easy to run. However it adds a huge element of difficulty as you progress and can find yourself retrying levels over and over. the great addition of multiplayer is great and is extremely fun co-op is extremely fun. It's a great easy to run game. I would 100% reccomend to those who need a challenge.

Masis	Recommended	35.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MasesDZ/	Amazing game with a wonderful storyline and cool Co-op multiplayer mode, The Graphics are high quality and the game rarely glitches. I do recommend the single player mode, the story is beautiful and deep. Requires alot of thinking for the puzzles(Test Chambers) but seriously worth it.Rating: 10/10Storyline: 9/10Co-op: 8.5/10

Kenji	Recommended	74.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xauyho/	OMG I would click the 'Yes' button on this game a HUNDRED TIMES! This game is literally my favourite. I recommend it to ALL players!
Fewster	Recommended	52.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fewsterr/	Thank you iGarfield for gifting me this, I really appreciate it!Reaaaallly entertaining and fun game, and it also has a very exciting storyline. Can't really describe how epic this game is. Just play it.9/10
BlaXpirit	Recommended	54.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blaxpirit/	This is, quite simply, the most unique game in the world. Everyone should play it.And there is so much to it: an exciting singleplayer campaign; interesting co-op campaign for 2 players with an intriguing ending; then there are "least portals placed" challenges to really make you think and speed challenges to test your skills (the challenges are especially good if you do them with a friend); and, of course, the most comfortable level editor ever, which allows people to make thousands of test chambers (which can be rated, so you can pick the best ones), so you can't say the game is repetitive...I didn't say much about the gameplay itself, because a video can tell much more.★★★★★★★★★★
rizzy uwu	Recommended	33.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rizkitsuneki/	Portal 2 is probably the only one of very few story-driven puzzle games, that are actually good and not being pretentious.

TheManiac17	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/themaniac17/	Want a game that will make you feel dumb? Well, look no further, Portal 2 is for you!In all seriousness, this game is genius. It really shows what Valve are capable of. The level design is perfect, the Source engine is used to it's full potential, and don't even get me started about the characters. The plot is absolutely unexpected (which is great), and, overall, better than Portal 1. :)The only downside would be the overly difficult levels. If you're new to the game, you'll browse youtube for walkthroughs, and feel really dumb when you realise how easy it actually was. But trust me, it's WORTH it. It's really reminiscent to Half-Life, especially in the second half of the game. That's another game that I loved, so bonus points for that. :pI might've found my new favourite game of all time. :D
Selcouth Lilith	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158354158/	This game is just genius, fun, challenging, your brain will melt a bit sometimes, absolutely recommended

mrguy0807	Recommended	41.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995200857/	Although the mechanics are the same as the first title with only a few additions, Portal 2 still feels like a completely different sort of game than the first Portal.The first Portal was short lived and very focused. Although there were some secrets and deviations the formula for Portal remained only compartmentalized puzzle solving, in a very controlled environment.Although this is still a puzzle game, it feels far less structured and controlled, allowing more room for experimentation and giving you less direction on how you are to complete certain objectives.It's also far longer than the first game, and with a much bigger focus on story.The story in the first Portal was excellent, and a big reason why it was so popular, but regardless, it wasn't the story that was driving the game forward, rather the sense of progression.This game, however, is entirely story driven. Levels are introduced along with the charactes that direct you in those levels, and the atmosphere of each area is unique to the narrative of the characters who are with you in each section.You want to complete puzzles in this game in order to learn more about the world, rather than you learning more about the world as you complete the puzzles.While I love this change, many people might miss the hyper-focused nature of the first game.If you're into the lore of the series Portal 2 is an absolutely wonderful game.If you're more focused on the gameplay, Portal 2 is still a wonderful game, although you may be disappointed by the amount of "fluff" that's present this time around.
Reanimate	Recommended	17.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/reanimateee/	Portal 2 is the best puzzle game I have ever played. Every puzzle is designed to challange your mind and your patience. It is a worthy sequel to Portal 1, and has been improved in almost every way.Postitives- Solid story that is intriguing and interesting- The lore has been given tons of depth. You learn much more about GLaDOs and Chell, the main protagonist. You also learn more about Aperture Science and it's creater, Cave Johnson.- The characters are more fleshed out and more interesting.- All the puzzles are great, and some are much harder than anything in Portal 1.- Much more detail in the enviorments compared to Portal 1, along with improved graphics and engine.- Challange Mode makes a return, combining Fewest portals and Lowest Time together.- Co-op mode is introduced, which is genius! It's been masterfully crafted and it's been given lots of thought. There's tons of useful tools like seeing what your partner sees using TAB, using F to set a waypoint on where you want your partner to look, and other useful stuff like timers and different symbols for the waypoint.- There is Steam Workshop support, where there are singleplayer and co-op maps created by the community. This gives the game infinite life and so much content.- This game runs on the Source engine, which can run on almost any computer within reason. A 5 year old GPU can most likely run this game at reasonable resolution and settings.Negatives- I can't think of any, but if I was to be forced to put one, it would be that it would be nice if the story was a bit longer. 5-6 hours is great for a type of game like Portal, but something like 8 or even 10 hours would've been fantastic.SummaryPortal 2 is a legendary puzzle game. It's nearly perfect in every way, from story, gameplay, setting, atmosphere, lore, depth, and many more things. It's worth every penny!Should you buy it? YES! I would recommend getting the Portal bundle as the first game is also really good.Make Portal 3 happen, Valve. PLEASEMy review on Portal 1

tydrt	Recommended	108.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tydrt/	This game is one of the best. I still come back to it many years after playing it. 10/10
cambo	Recommended	46.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/camboteeth/	amazing game. timeless, definitely a must-have.
Depreee birdy	Recommended	37.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/derpybirds/	– The storyYou are set in the future where a Robot called GLaDOS is presented as a sarcastic nemesis who just won’t leave you alone. You first are introduced to a seemingly friendly floating robot head Wheatley. He takes you through a bunch of tests which GLaDOS is presenting you with while he tries to take over the place. What happens next You have to find out for yourself.– My thought’sThe game itself is a piece of Art. Everything about the game just screams yes. The game is about puzzles and thinking with portals. If you haven’t played the first portal that’s ok, I’ve played the first portal a long time ago and it didn’t impact the second game that much. Story mode of the game is done perfectly, voice acting as silly as it may in a robot game is done very well + animations are great. Maybe the only way it would be improved if you could play co-op with more people, other than that it’s perfect. I personally like the introductions of the Portal gun. Co-op was executed as good as you can possibly execute it, I was stunned to see how well the Multiplayer was made. A lot of games don’t have a good co-op system and/or multiplayer, but Portal 2 just took made it as easy as possible. If you wish to play co-op I suggest finishing singleplayer beforehand. Co-op doesn’t include a story, but rather multiple puzzles for you and your friend. I honestly can’t find anything bad to say about this game because it is just perfect, little to no bugs at all.– The summaryThe game is excellent for people who wan’t to challenge themselves and friends.– The Pros+ Story – The game has an excellent story mode for you to complete.+ Co-op – This game includes a co-op mode for you and your friends to play, and can be set up in a matter seconds.+ Smooth graphics – The graphics of the game are just stunning and perform well even for not so good computers.+ Little to no Bugs – In my time of gameplay I didn’t experience any bug at all.+ Community workshop – When I found out I could play other people’s creations I was just sucked even more into the game then before.+ Level editor – Another option the game allows is a custom editor for you to make your own maps and creations and share with the world.+ Independant game – What I mean by this is, even if you haven’t played the first portal game you don’t need to because the game’s story mode isn’t affected by the other game.– The Cons+ Short ending – To be honest this is the only thing I could put on this, it doesn’t even deserve a “The bad” section because it was so darn good.+ Micro-Transactions – The only way to customize your character within the game is to spend a few bucks on a skin.– The rating + I would rate the game a solid 9/10 just because of the performance and everything about it. Definitely suggest this game to your more puzzle-loving friends.

hennis	Recommended	23.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hennibbale/	Portal 2. What a game.Note: I hadn't internet these days, and I decided to finish it, so I spent something 3 more hours (Steam doesn't record them while you're offline). Best choice of my life.SingleplayerHow I feel about it:I feel like this game... is one of the best games ever made. It has all it needs to be one of them. It gives you emotions, a lot of different and mixed emotions. This game makes you feel bad, pathetic, frustrated AND happy, satisfied, loved.I loved this game. The way you have to think, the hours I've spent looking for the ♥♥♥♥ing impossible solution that was at the end the simplest thing in there.I don't even know why people do bad reviews of this. This is the ultimate game experience.You'll feel lonely and abandoned. You are ALONE. It's just yourself and SPOILER ALERT a super-smart computer trapped in a potato, that keeps insulting and demotivating you, ending with being friends of you.CO-OP modeI still haven't finished it, but when I'll do (I'll surely do it) I'll edit this.As you probably know, Portal 2 has got a co-op mode. It's designed for 2 players, and they have to co-operate to solve the puzzles.I played this with many friends, and it has always been fun. The fact that GlaDOS gets angry when you are doing random stuff is funny. When you troll your mate, that's so ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious.OverallPros:-AMAZING storyline-good and fluid gameplay-even a potato computer HA! do you get it? could run it-funny co-op mode-has good puzzles-user created levels (Steam Workshop)Cons:-some parts are frustratingNothing more, really. It's a 10/10 game in my opinion.If you are confused on buying this game or not, stop thinking.BUY IT, NOW.

Don Corleone	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DonMCorleone/	Brilliant!!!Mind-blowing single player that put your brain on fire and Excellent Co-op mode that requires true cooperation and somehow sync between players.One of the best games of history and in my opinion best co-op ever!By the way, it is full of fun.
Chris	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrluchador/	Not entirly sure what to say about Portal 2 that hasn't already been said in either Steam reviews or elsewhere. All I can do is add to those thoughts.It's a fun game, and at times a little challenging. It's perhaps not as challenging as the original Portal was, and the increased story elements take away from the awe of a story actually unfolding before your eyes in what appeared to be a straightforward puzzle game. Yet, Portal 2 has a lot of humor and the characters are great. The story is fun to follow and only adds to the experience. There are a few Easter Eggs in the game for Valve fans, which is a nice touch. In short - sit back, play and enjoy.

Mungojerrie	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013136696/	A true sequel. Everything Portal does, Portal 2 does better. It looks better, has more content and offers more variety, is more exposition and story-heavy, but not to a degree which would be detrimental to the core gameplay. It is a niche genre, but a game for everyone, both challenging and forgiving enough. While a tad too easy sometimes, it still is rewarding after its more difficult sequences are beaten. If you liked Portal, certainly give this one a try, it indeed is a time well spent.

kony	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kony4/	A decent puzzle game with great audiovisuals and story (for a puzzle game).

I recommend it to everyone, even those who dislike puzzle games.

-Largo-	Recommended	13.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043061381/	Unlike its predecessor, where you were stuck in white rooms all the time, Portal 2 features some of the best leveldesign seen in history of computer gaming. Particularly in the mid  game, you'll see a lot of the Aperture facility and the machinery outside the usual testing rooms, and those environments look amazing.Now about the gameplay, since this is still a puzzle game at the core; Portal 2 chooses to have a lower puzzle density and instead, you'll spend more time walking around and exploring Aperture. You could say it's less puzzle and more game. The tests themselves are usually pretty straightforward, some require a bit of trial and error and thinking, but none should hold you up for longer than a few minutes. If the tests are all you are looking for in this kind of game, one could argue Portal 2 is inferior to the first game in the series. However, I believe that the change of pace was significantly improved, and the leveldesign alone makes this game more than worth playing.

Ann D	Recommended	48.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/andymisandry/	It's really two games. One is a sequel to Portal, and it's a funny, if short, plot-driven adventure. It's as superbly written as ever, though perhaps with a broader approach to comedy than its darker, more laser-guided predecessor. It's satisfying as a puzzle game, though I don't think it goes as far with its new mechanics as it should do. The second game is a masterful linear co-op puzzle experience, with some of the most devious, brain-wracking, death-defying challenges in a videogame. What would be endlessly frustrating in singleplayer becomes a light, fun, only occasionally murderous fun-with-friend time. Two brains are better than one, after all. Well. Sometimes. Sadly, I can't really recommend Portal 2 unless you can play the co-op sections with a friend who hasn't already played it. The singleplayer is cool, but it's ultimately the less fulfilling of the two campaigns. The game's mod scene, mind, may well make up for it, as a post-release user level editor is easy-to-use and has resulted in a bevy of player-created test chambers that should, if nothing else, keep you occupied for a long time.
toorBoi	Recommended	41.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/toorBoi/	This is a fantastic puzzle game to play with friends.  If you're playing alone, you'll find a captivating story.  This is a very well done game.
BazzarSpider	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bazzarspider123/	What can I say that hasn't been said before? This game is absolutely stunning, with amazing personality, charming characters, mysterious plot and tight gameplay. The puzzle solving will test your ability to connect different situations and it truly is a fantastic thing to solve a puzzle that you have been stuck in for hours. The controls are tight and you feel in power of all of your movements, as in any Source game. The multiplayer is great and fun, as long as you have a microphone, trying to play this with just the text chat or the in-game pointing system just doesn't quite cut it. I hope they continue the franchise some time in the future and they continue the story of Chell. If you have a medium-tier PC, you can totally run this game without a problem and expierence of the best games of the modern era. 9/10

You wake up after a long time from stasis in the abandoned facility of Aperture Science. New puzzles, new types of levels, and a story that goes from working with GlaDOS again to a story that goes behind the scenes of a former CEO of Aperture Science and a loyal personal assistant who seems familiar. Funny moments in the game as well as serious moments. If you were a fan of Portal, then get this game. Heck, in fact, if you're getting Portal the first time, get this one too if there is a bundle!

Crash	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/b4283/	Begin with the game you woke up in a room which resembles an typical hotel room, then some banging on the door begins the great adventure of our heroine Chell. A sudden shake-off of the room which reveals the room is actually one container of 10 thousand people multi-complex. The show begins with an tremendous fashion. It appeals the player right away as if it is inviting them into the story.And right away do you also feel the witty sarcasm which exists throughout the entire game. When the robot manager tell you: `This is art, stare at the art for 5 seconds.' and then plays classical music, it just makes me smile. The script writers are geniuses. The lines are comical but not too funny, and with a sense of dark humor. The robot themselves are always joking around with the death or termination of themselves, and sometimes to each other too. Almost childish but not overdone. Especially GLaDOS herself is a very charming character, I have to confess I fell in love with GLaDOS when she tried to talk Wheatley into a paradox, and mumbling "dont think about it dont think about it". It's just so cute.The story and background setting are definitely deepened deliberately this time. When I played the first three chambers I was kind of worried they are just remaking Portal 1 - because I played 2 right after 1 so I could remember the puzzles as the same. Gladly they weren't! It's a fairly lengthy brand new game - about 8 hours - and every minute of it worths it. They put a lot of effort laying the background and showing the player how Aperture and the facility come to be. They laid huge architectural work for the game, I couldn't even imagine how big the facility is because it was so massive, there are so many rooms which you can't see the top end or the bottom end - which surprisingly reminds me of BioShock not at the time of playing but now. I've seen Valve done this large-world trick before in Half-Life 2, and I know they are getting good at it because this one is even better.Music is great, not repetitive and well paced. Voice acting is tremendous, both Wheatley and GLaDOS.The end game was also very good (and surprising!). I'm very happy that they didn't make the final boss very hard - after all, who would want to fight a difficult boss after solving all the puzzles? The tired player deserves a relaxed good show.10/10, I haven't felt this kind of excitement for years, and Portal 2 brought it to me. It's a fine piece of work and I strongly recommended it.Ps: I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I heard it's very good too.

Kritzy	Recommended	28.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AtomicalWut/	This game was good, but unfortunatly short, maybe it's just maybe thinking that but I don't know. It had many twists and turns, comedic moments, heartbreak, challenging puzzles, lovable characters, a great continuation, and overall some of the best voice actors to exist, play it and don't look up walkthroughs or watch anything with spoilers, why no walkthroughs? well you can do whatever you want but at the end of the game, the overwhelming happiness and proudity of yourself is great. No spoilers because this game is best played with no idea what will happen except how the mechanics of the game works. All in all, for something from 2011, this games graphics are up to date to even Battlefield 1. As my last sentence, I hope anyone reading this takes my advice, enjoy the game.

Raddude1221	Recommended	10.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/raddude1221/	This is a must-get if you want to be a true member of steam lol.  It is quite tasking on the brain at times, but it also evens itself out with a variety of characters and a deep storyline.

laudal	Recommended	122.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029093963/	This is how a sequel is done. A perfect sequel. A little bit harder then portal 1 and thats a good thing. Solid music, a good story, brilliant atmospheric, a very great platformer/puzzle game with humour. And just long enough too. I (for once) can`t find any cons on this game.I will also like to add that playing this with a friend coop ,both the story and mods is fantastic. This is probably one of my favourite games ever regardless of platform and genre10/10 no doubt on of the best platformers along with it prequel and smg. Highly recommended.Updated as of 21.11.2016

RunnerFaith	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RunnerFaith/	Let me start by saying I'm quite a fan of the Portal series. The gameplay ideas are well thought out and the aesthetics of an old, worn down Aperture Science are stunning.The voice acting is amazing. Ellen Mclain's voice acting for GLaDOS is delightful, and Wheatley... oh, there's so many words to describe...The gameplay was very unique, you started out with a few levels from the first Portal game, before being thrown into a new set of tests, in a barren Aperture Sceince.When I got to the gel levels, I literally just sat there, saying to myself "Wow... just, wow."Overall, I highly recommend this game to anyone who wants a fresh take on the Puzzle genre and for those who have time to kill.

SenseiOfWorms | LIVE	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sensei4/	In last 20 years, I maybe played 3-4 games in Singleplayer till finish. Whatever game it is, it just bores me after 1-2 hours max. Never could figure out why ppl would choose repetitive AI moves instead of online pvp matchmaking. Portal2 is different. Never seen anything similar before. Great puzzles, awesome narrators. Try it, you won't regret.

From the puzzles, to the humor, to the world tie-ins with Half Life this game remains a must play for anyone who enjoys puzzle games at all. There is a reason we all sit around hoping Valve will once again pick up the torch and make games, and games like Portal and Portal 2 are a good part of it. More seriously though, the games puzzles were interesting and didn’t get tiresome. With this game they brought several new tricks to use, and dialed the wit up nicely with new characters beyond just chell and GlaDOS. Overall it was an excellent game with a witty, if linear, storyline, and provided great enjoyment. Highly recommend!

Tenshinohana	Recommended	38.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tenshinohana/	One of the best games you'll ever play, I guarantee it.Portal 2 has two great different game modes: Singleplayer and Co-Op. Sadly, if you don't have any friends, you won't be able to play the co-op, but in my opinion, the singleplayer alone would be worth your money.Your problem solving skills will come to a test while playing this, but the story alone in this game is something to love; Portal 2 is a perfect example of great narration and character interaction with the player. The characters are enjoyable and the gameplay is easy enough to master. You can explore and find easter eggs that tell you more about the plot and the world you're in.The co-op is also entertaining. Puzzles that you have to solve with a friend? Nothing could be more fun! The commands help communication alot - you can watch your friend in a small window to see what he sees, and with the easy commands you can tell your friend what to do. You practically don't need voice chat at all, but it does help alot! The puzzles in the game are fun as well, as the small storyline that goes along with the co-op - nothing major, but still enjoyable. And the community maps are endless - you can always get more community made maps, that can be wonderful to play through!TL;DR: 10/10, would play again. Must buy game if on sale in Steam!You can also have a drinking game with a friend, if one of you fails, take a shot. You'll get hammered in no time, because mistakes are bound to happen.

CJSiev	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198217051291/	I'm going to tell you all a little story. A story of me, and my experiences with this amazing game.A few years back, I bought the game for my X-box 360. Unfortunatly, I bought Portal 2 before I bought the first one. I was fairly confused on a lot of things, but it didn't effect my experience much. This was before I had Steam, or even a computer, and I couldn't find the first one on disk. Anyways, Portal 2 quickly became my favourite game. I loved everything about it, and still do. I quickly finished the game, and moved on. Over the next few years, it still remained my favourite game. I spent a lot of time looking at all the easter eggs and references in the game. When I finally got a computer and Steam, I bought the first game, and loved it. Then i decided to buy Portal 2 for Steam, for a multitude of reasons. Mostly because it was on sale. As most puzzle games are, the game wasn't quite the same as the first time, but still remains my favourite. I pocked around in all the corners, looking for the easter eggs I'd seen online, and the game was almost as great as the first time. It was easier, as I knew what to do, but still absolutely amazing. So, I highly recommend this game. 1000/10. Go buy it. Play it. Have fun doing it. This game is hard not to enjoy. Evarything is great. the jokes, the puzzles, the characters. it still remains my favourite game to this day, and will likely stay that way, at least until Portal 3, or Half Life 3 is released. GabeN please make it. Plz

SergeantMiyagi	Recommended	26.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SergeantMiyagi/	Portal 2 is one of the most splendid and captivating sequels in videogaming history as it introduces a cast of dynamic new characters, a host of fresh puzzle elements, and a much larger set of devious test chambers.Portal 2 is an improvement on what was already a tremendous game, the campaign is considerably longer, the visuals are wonderful, the soundtrack is magnificent and the gameplay is more exquisite.Probably the best feature about Portal 2 is the 2 players cooperative experience featuring its own dedicated story, characters, and gameplay.This game is a masterpiece and I highly recommend it as one of the best games I've ever player.

GBMusicMaster	Recommended	1,567.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gbmusicmaster/	This is, hands down, my favorite game of all time.  I love the mystery of it.  I love the humor of it.  I love that I don't have to have lightning-fast reflexes and a RedBull IV drip to play it.  Best of all, once you've finished the scripted game, YOU CAN MAKE YOUR OWN PUZZLES!!!  I have made over 50 of my own so far, and I'm nowhere close to finished.  I love this game, and I think you will too.

BrokenLink	Recommended	236.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/br0kenl1nk/	VALVe did it again. Portal 2 is a masterpiece, a game that encapsulates what a puzzle game should be. Terrific writing, three-dimensional characters brimming with life, innovative gameplay and perfect pacing are just some of the game's aspects that VALVe nailed. With free DLCs being given out (including a new co-op course and a user-friendly Puzzle Maker) and its price lowered to the point of theft, there is simply no excuse for you not to buy this game THIS instant. Do it.
SpAzArDoUs	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpAzArDoUs/	Awesome game! So fun to play with a friend!
(・8・) Rem says	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/actuallyram/	Just like its predecessor, Portal 2 is a game worthy of praise for being original, exciting, and just plain ol' good fun for anybody. The game's layout is designed to teach you certain game mechanics so you can proceed to later areas while utilising your prior knowledge to solve those areas too, just like the first Portal game.All in all, Portal 2 is an astounding game I would rate 10/10 and would highly recommend to anybody who hasn't played it yet.Story ++Gameplay ++Graphics ++Cost ++Uniqueness ++To be honest, I can't believe how late I was to playing this game, it was truly breathtaking.
DMYTRO	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dmytro-i/	Once you break her heart in Portal you'll be wanting to face her again.An amazing continuation of an awesome game.

Delta	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/delta0/	Very impressive, one of the best design game I have ever played.
Crash	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/b4283/	Begin with the game you woke up in a room which resembles an typical hotel room, then some banging on the door begins the great adventure of our heroine Chell. A sudden shake-off of the room which reveals the room is actually one container of 10 thousand people multi-complex. The show begins with an tremendous fashion. It appeals the player right away as if it is inviting them into the story.And right away do you also feel the witty sarcasm which exists throughout the entire game. When the robot manager tell you: `This is art, stare at the art for 5 seconds.' and then plays classical music, it just makes me smile. The script writers are geniuses. The lines are comical but not too funny, and with a sense of dark humor. The robot themselves are always joking around with the death or termination of themselves, and sometimes to each other too. Almost childish but not overdone. Especially GLaDOS herself is a very charming character, I have to confess I fell in love with GLaDOS when she tried to talk Wheatley into a paradox, and mumbling "dont think about it dont think about it". It's just so cute.The story and background setting are definitely deepened deliberately this time. When I played the first three chambers I was kind of worried they are just remaking Portal 1 - because I played 2 right after 1 so I could remember the puzzles as the same. Gladly they weren't! It's a fairly lengthy brand new game - about 8 hours - and every minute of it worths it. They put a lot of effort laying the background and showing the player how Aperture and the facility come to be. They laid huge architectural work for the game, I couldn't even imagine how big the facility is because it was so massive, there are so many rooms which you can't see the top end or the bottom end - which surprisingly reminds me of BioShock not at the time of playing but now. I've seen Valve done this large-world trick before in Half-Life 2, and I know they are getting good at it because this one is even better.Music is great, not repetitive and well paced. Voice acting is tremendous, both Wheatley and GLaDOS.The end game was also very good (and surprising!). I'm very happy that they didn't make the final boss very hard - after all, who would want to fight a difficult boss after solving all the puzzles? The tired player deserves a relaxed good show.10/10, I haven't felt this kind of excitement for years, and Portal 2 brought it to me. It's a fine piece of work and I strongly recommended it.Ps: I haven't played the multiplayer yet, but I heard it's very good too.
TeslaVet	Recommended	216.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bamo305/	-If you don't care about stories and want a longer playthough get this-if you care about stories get the orignal and this. Pros: +Beautiful level design+Smooth gameplay (Even for older computers)+Fun solving puzzles+Interesting story+Pretty graphics+Longer then the first game+Awesome characters with great humor+Creative soundtracks+Co-op+Workshop maps Cons: -Puzzles are easier then Portal 1-Not to much replay value efter beating campaign a couble of times.

WholesomeMemes Kyle	Recommended	31.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198345005098/	Had this on PS3 and just bought it on steam to start trying out the workshop maps and mods for co-op. One of a kind game and worth every penny. Runs very well on my potato laptop as well. The game is incredibly unique and it creates its own genre, it will always be one of my favorites and I can only hope they will create a Portal 3 in the future. 11/10

Pius XII the Hentai Pope	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125269735/	Portal 2 is a puzzle platformer FPS. This game has amazing story with challenging puzzles. In this sequel they added a co-op mode to play with your friends. You going to have a lot of fun with your friend.(if u r not a salty peasant) The graphic still looks good to this very day. This game too has soundtrack just as amazing as "Still Alive" from Portal. I finished the game in 7 hours. For some people that might be too short but I am satisfied with it because it fills with great moments. I would rather have a short but quality story than a long but dull campaign. (like recent CODs) 9/10. GLaDOS best grill.

winterbraid	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/winterbraid/	All of the old tricks, a bunch of new tricks, and even more GlaDOS than ever before - what's there not to love? This time, the trusty portal gun will be not only your weapon in a battle of wits against cybernetic malevolence, but also an instrument of story-telling and a tool of exploration as the game throws you out of the septic confinement of test chambers and into cyclopean environments that guard the history of Aperture Labs. Some of the locations have an almost "open world" feeling about them and the puzzles will often turn into a challenge of "Find Waldo" involving portal-able surfaces, and many of them could be described as "cheap" in retrospect. Yet the story and the consistently amazing character writing are enough to keep you going even through the most frustrating of trials.

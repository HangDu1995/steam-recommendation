Mr. Unforgiven	Recommended	1,907.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrUnforgivenTM/	So I have played this game for a couple years now with a break of 8 months between it because of some updates who got me from MGE back to the silvers..So now I am back at it again and I am kinda in love again. Yes I also think they should change the VAC and Cooldown system, because it is pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥atm. But if you just play the game like you should play it, it is a pretty good game.Before my pause I spend a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of money on skins, i had a♥♥♥♥♥♥load, I sold them all and at this point I only use the skins I get dropt in game or didnt sold. So the latest update ( adding wingman and scoutgame) I think thats pretty good. Only thing is they should change the wingman stuff. Because I played a couple times against people who are Global on competive so that is nog fair yet. Also the cooldown system should be sepperate. but the game is good.

christoff . cs.money	Recommended	12,475.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960864455/	I've been playing Counter-Strike since around 2000 when it was 1.6 beta.  It was a natural progression for me from HL Deathmatch which was a ton of fun back in the day also.  I've been loyal to this game for almost 20 years and have racked up hours I wouldn't even want to know playing it, but i've had a ton of fun with it too!! It's funny to watch and participate in something as it evolves and grows, especially to something that has become so popular on a global scale and not only that, without CS I question if there would even be a Steam service.  It's funny how things happen!!  Nobody will ever read this so i have no idea why i'm spending the time writing a review of this type, especially when i started out just to gain a credit for more XP, funny :)  CS and the community have got me through a few difficult times in my life and i'm forever grateful for that, but I have to say that the current state of affairs with the game, steam and Valve are a little sad.  There's no interraction with the fanbase of the game that made Valve and Steam what it is today, and that's very disappointing for me.  Valve own such a fantastic product but appear to have lost sight of their roots and where all their success came from.  The development of the game has lagged behind and if not careful will quickly become the way of the Blackberry (I was going to say DoDo but thought BBerry was just the same and applicable!).  Why has there not been greater advancement of the Source platform to take better advantage of today's gaming PC horsepower and reinvigourate a community that's becoming quickly displeased with the lack of communication as to the games direction, as well as current play-ability, variety and lack of transparancy?  If Valve have no intentions of investing the required resources and money into developing this sleeping giant of games into something that will see an explosion of interest, praise and thanks from the gaming community as a whole then...why not sell it to someone who will take it forward with purpose fans like me are crying out for???  Think about it and get back to me why don't you (and i'll be offered a job by valve to lead the team forward into delivering a product the community really wants - sarcasm).My review won't be complete without touching on the current Steam vs Opskins, and the whole trading saga in general. Why won't Valve introduce an age bracket market for trading etc. that requires Government official Photo ID Age verification that removes certain restrictions like trading for and returning real money etc.?  There's so much potential there, the market history proves that, so why not consider offering more than one type of service?  It's a little shortsighted from ValSteam to not consider their market demographics are as varied as the number of games on sale in their store and have never really persued any course of action to capitalize on those different market segments, or maybe you are, or, maybe you're just dealing with so much legal backlog from the "loot box" gambling situation?!?!?!  Who know's?  Certainly nobody in the community, why?  No communication.  Is it because you don't think you're client base are capable of comprehending the current situation or is it because the majority of your client base are 15 and under and you don't consider that a worthwhile demographic to answer to?  A closing comment on this particular aspect of the review...Valve/Steam...please remember that every year that client base grows, so does the diversity of age and the growing expectations from a community you yourselves helped build, so be prepared and be willing to change or you too, will go the same way as the Blackberry DoDo. Anyway, CS is a great game and I'll always play it and just like every place in this world, both real and virtual, you will find the majority of people are good and don't cheat, but you also get the least desireable of people you find everywhere too and thankfully, like everywhere else, they're the minority.CheersChrisP.S. UPDATE - My hours are incorrect. My pc is never off for other reasons and CS is running in the background idling just like my AV.  Save your time if you were going to post a comment about my hours, pleeaaasee

TURBOSKILL	Recommended	1,216.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TURBOSKILL/	It doesn't matter how good you are any more, you will be judged solely on the market value of your inventory.You should have one of your several Karambit knives equipped at all times and inspect it in game whenever possible to ensure that anybody who is spectating you is aware that you are aware you're being watched and you are absolutely showing off that extremely pricey knife you own.Your stats are irrelevant now, most people aren't even aware that the 'Tab' key actually has a function in game. It doesn't matter if you don't know what 'eco' means. Fu­ck team work. You have a 'BOOM' AWP in your inventory, as long as you have $4750 cash in game you're buying an AWP.You will mock anyone who decided to give their Nova the 'Walnut' skin. Same goes for people who give their FAMAS the 'Doomkitty' skin. You will only equip 'StatTrak' weapons and the first thing you do when you acquire one is go on an idle server and get several hundred kills on AFK players in order to pad the stats so you don't look like a total n00b.Whenever a new case is released you will buy as many cases and keys as it takes in order to acquire 'an Exceedingly Rare Special Item!' Disregard the fact that you will end up spending three times as much as you otherwise would've by buying this directly from the market, it's only your parents' money after all. Besides, your birthday is next month and Christmas/Easter/[insert public holiday here] is just around the corner so you won't have to wait too long before you can blow more of their money on digital goods.You will also plaster ever single skin you own with multiple unseemly stickers with the intention of creating a unique skin for your weapon. Your 'Easy Peasy' and 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' stickers totally don't look ridiculous whatsoever. You will also name tag all of your weapons in order to add that final personal touch to the weapon you invested so much time and money in. You don't own an AK or an M4 any more, you only own weapons with names like 'xXx OG Snoop Dogg' and 'dubstep warrior'.You now have all the knowledge required to start playing CS:GO. Go forth and procure many skins of great value.

RedK	Recommended	1,277.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012464612/	2.7 million reviews as of writing this. lolBeen playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 that came out in 2002. For some of us it has a lot of memories and childhood nostalgia. To keep it short yes, I would recommend to see what all the fuss is about if you haven't already.To try and write something useful here is my advice to you, new player, if you want to improve:* It's alright you suck, CS:GO is a highly highly skill based game, don't sweat it. If you're not having fun sucking, though, you should probably quit. There will be a lot of sucking and it's OK to rage sometimes, but if it's constant no fun just move on* Get a good mouse specifically for first-person shooters. No, that Razer Naga you play World of Warcraft with won't do. Google 'Rocket Jump Ninja mice' for good recommendations from a 19+ years Quake player* Alongside the mouse, REALLY I mean REALLY spend the time to find your mouse sensitivity. It is worth it. There are plenty of guides to google* have a MINIMUM of 60 FPS, otherwise you're really gimping yourself. Personally I wouldn't play without at least a steady 100* No, you don't need a 144Hz monitor, I reached Global (highest official rank) perfectly fine without it. It is nice though if you can afford it* As with anything, consistency and practice is key. The other rarely mentioned but just as important thing, though, is TAKE BREAKS. If you feel burnt out just play something else. It's fine. You will come back fresh and ready to improve* If you won, but didn't improve - you lost. If you lost, but you improved - you won. Have this mindset and your results will take care of themselves* SoloQ is really as any other game, if you have a hard time handling negativity this also might not be for you. I personally just mute any sort of toxicity and that works for me* Get a PRIME account (reach lvl 21) ASAP and only play with it enabled when possible. The increase in game quality is noticableGood luck!

Troy	Recommended	1,267.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/troydesante/	Want a real and honest review? Here you go:Used to be one of the best FPS games out there. At this point the game is so broken and badly maintained. Dev's don't listen to the players and just do things to the game nobody wanted.What players asked: New missions and 128-tick servers. What do we get? We get some nice updates of never wanted gloves with free game breaking addons. Oh how about we give you a nice new sound system nobody wanted just because we can.Let's talk about the VAC system (Valve Anti Cheat):Probally one of the worst working anti cheat systems out there. People can go spinbotting / wallhacking ingame without insta triggering red flags, no they just get a some people in overwatch after 10 reports looking at it. Instead of building a better VAC system to help keep the game fun and fair, they give us gloves and game breaking addons.But I guess if they made the VAC system better half of the pro's out there get insta banned and then it's bye bye CS:GO.  Soon 1.000 hours for me, never had a higher then 0.03€ skin drop, a friend of mine played, gets a 250€ M4A1-S drop with his first deathmatch... It's random but maybe recode it so things like this don't happen because it absolut BS.But after all, I enjoy the game even tho 1/3 games gives a hacker and 1/2 games give a high chance of dropping you in a game full of russians.VALVE, fix your game like the PEOPLE want it:- 128-tick servers- Better VAC system, even tho half the pro's gets banned- Fix bugs in the game / maps instead of adding gloves just to get more money- Different servers for RU / EU with no way to mix those together- Fix those damn hitboxes- Add that's it recommended to have a microphone and have some basic English knowledge.Game: 8/10 Good game in general, could use some better hitboxesMaps: 7/10 Some maps just have so low FPS for people it's unplayableDev's: 5/10 Give a lot broken updates but fixes them more or less within 2 weeksServers: 6/10 Some Valve servers are laggy and they should be split between RU / EU / Asia / US Total: 6.5/10Would I buy it again?: To play a broken game with russians?

Zack Hemsey is my jesus	Recommended	3,395.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Clockwork___/	I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 5:46, am. Damn.Another night of Insomnia.  I sit up in my bed, and listen to the soft hum of my Radeon™ HD 7870 GHz Edition, as her fans slowly cool the surface of her brilliant silicon plates. The only light in this room comes from the electric blue glow of my keyboard, and the azure LEDs in my Razer Abyssus.I press a button, and the display of a 23 inch, 1080p IPS monitor lights up, colors shifting and changing in psychedelic pattens, chromatic waves of light bluring and stabilizing to send an image within my mind. My desktop stares back at me; the only icon the Recycle bin. I move my eyes to the Taskbar, where the icons for Windows Explorer, Star Citizen, Mozilla Firefox, and lastly Steam return my gaze.I click on Steam, and watch as a loading bar appears. The light from the moniter shines brilliantly on my face, and if I look closely into it, I can see myself reflected in the crystal surface, eyes staring deep into a mad realm of pixels and insomnia.Steam finally loads. Oh, what's this? There's a sale on? Ah, too bad; I only have one cent in my wallet. I click the library tab in a futile attempt to find meaning.My list of games appears, showing me hints of open doors into new worlds, strange and wonderful. What path sould I choose? Should I join battle with Dragons, in the strage land of the Nords? Or, perhaps, I should launch the StarCitizen hangar module, and lust after a dream of flight, a game not yet finished.Ah, but here it is; Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. How many hours have I thus spent within you, oh CS:GO? You have been the reason for many nights without sleep, many days of ragequits, many days of fun and sadness. I pull out a calculator from somewhere on my desk: dividing one thousand, eight hundred and eighty-five hours by twenty-four tells me that I've been within this game for seventy-eight point five days so far. Damn.The game begins loading, and I hear the soft hum of GPU fans, and the silent sound of the sunrise, far beyond the single window of my room._Ah, where was I? I guess I feel alseep for a second there. Skip the intros, enter main menu, searc- Wait, what? 20 friends online? But, it's like 6 am... Oh, right, timezones. Eh, I might as well invite all these people.Well, I guess I didn't want to play with them anyway. Green light fills my room, I press accept, and wait for the ninth player. Who, it seems, never can figure out what the big glowing green button actually means. Oh well, it just found another match anyway.Well, third time's the chram, right? I guess not. Fourth time does it, and we're away. Cue loading screen, begin meaningless text I've seen only a few thousand times before.I get up, walk towards the kitchen, and only trip twice on miscellaneous paraphernalia in the dark hallways. The bleak windows of the room greet me: pale dawn, gray clouds and black trees visible through their panes. The neon numerals of the microwave tell the time as 6:07. I search the pantry and refr!gerator, but find nothing of value.I lower my standards and try again, this time coming up with a few tastless cookies of some kind. I begin a pilgrimage to whence I came.The last stars of night grow cold and die; as color once again spreads over the sky. Monitor glow, winter snow, cybernetic flow.My quest now complete, with prize in hand, I return to my chair. 0's and 1's stream across a fiberoptic gulf of space, connecting people hundreds of miles apart in a beautiful lattice of data, all for my enjoyment. I begin the first round, and purchase a FN Five-Seven and a Flashbang grenade.I move over to long A, and hold my sights on the old wooden doors. An insurgent sprints through the open door, firing his Glock-18 as fast as he can, his bullets hitting the wal beside my head.I pull the trigger, a volcanic plume of hot gas propelling a one gram lead alloy projectile at twice the speed of sound into the side of his head; The FN 5.7×28mm armor piercing round delivering a fatal 540 Joules of energy. The neon Stattrak™ display mounted on the left side of my Case Hardened Five-Seven increases by one, and a bright flare from the muzzle reflects its light in the cold metal of a name tag, the words "NOT ON MY WATCH" silently mocking those fools who fall by my pistol, in an absurd pun about clocks.Another Terrorist moves into view, I fire three supersonic rounds into his chest, and one in his skull. Again the neon numbers shift and rearrange in a mad dance, as bullets enter my manly chest hair and are absorbed.A third Terrorist fires, and I die in the gameworld, madly shooting as my bullets hit empty space. Pixels shift and change in an algorithmic song, and my teammates finish what I began, with the severing of a red wire a small number one is added in blue to the top of my screen.Second round, man. Time to roll. I got long-  wait, why are two of you going there? Nevermind, I'll hold Catwalk._Turns out they decided to rush Mid with pistols. Poor choice.  I leap out of catwalk into mid as they rush the doors, electric blue pathways of fire traversing the void between my tazer and and the insurgent's back. He screams in death as I drop the now-useless tazer and unholster a Bizon SMG;  9mm rounds begining to sputter at 320 meters per second into the backs of my foes as a Terrorist pulls a 180 and flicks a round into my skull with his CZ-75 Automatic, punching through my helmet into the flesh beneath. I mutter to myself "I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that gun" while typing out "#TAZED ♥♥♥♥♥" in all chat.Childish insults fly like eagles, soaring over skies of wire and valleys of silicon to majestically land in the lower right of my vision, proclaiming their wondrous messages for all to see. "get rekt" "u suck" "TIME to die, amirite"Using the mighty power of a pistol save round, the enemy gains a round.From far beyond my drywall cube, a sun the color of a Helium discharge tube bleeds the first light of Autumn into a sky the color of Krypton: but here I am safe from its incandescent fingers, here, the persistance of color exists in the 60hz of my monitor. Perhaps tomorrow will be different? Oh, but I don't think it will.The scoreboard moves with its own hateful volition, seemingly granting rounds with a heart of cinder and magma. Chaos lies within its eyes.Final round of the first half begins and I press f1 to auto buy, supplanting my XM1014 from the previous round with an M4A4 Bullet Rain, tastefully decorated with a "REKT" holographic sticker and renamed "Clockwork Ass♥♥♥♥ing". I once again reflect on what a stupid name that is, and regret selling my Desert Eagle Blaze to buy it.Surprisingly, my team manages to hold a push at long. In the simultaneous push to cat a rain of lead from a thundering sky finds my face with magnetic precision, and in the downtime I skim through my Ebook library on my phone. I've been considering writing something in the style of Neuromancer or Ready Player One for awhile now, perhaps if I can find the right subject... Oh well, that's a project for another day. Translation: never.Halftime, and the tally stands at ten for them and five for us. I've seen worse. I've seen better too, but what the hell, this isn't hopeless yet.Pistol round begins and I buy Dualies, partly just to ♥♥♥♥ with people and partly because for reasons that I can neither explain nor defend I'm ridiculously good with them. Don't dis my Dualie skills, man. Just accept it. Like a wizard and his wand: you do not choose the Dualies, the Dualies choose you.I pop smoke Mid and rush Catwalk, suddenly realizing I hit the character limit while subsequently breaking the 4th wall.I slowly look at the luminescent green dial of my wristwatch, which tells me it is 6:34, am. Damn.Another night of Insomnia.

DUNCAN DONUTS	Recommended	19.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/teflon1/	In this game you are a Terrorist or elite Counter-Terrorist who has never fired a gun in their life before a round starts. You must help your character learn how to control their guns while killing enemies. Strangely, each character has the mysterious power to fire one or two shots without ridiculous recoil by very briefly jerking in the opposite direction they are moving in. When your character wears a Kevlar vest, every part of your character, except the head, are made out of steel. Therefore, the only way to quickly kill people is to shoot them in the head. This can be annoying at first, but you will soon get used to shooting a small smudge of pixels on top of a character's body. The Goddess of Guns can materialize guns in your character's hands a few seconds before a round starts. However, your character must pay for the guns, which have vastly overinflated prices. When you have the right amount of money, the Goddess will flash a menu in your character's eyes, allowing them to select the guns they want. More advanced users can make guns materialize out of thin air with their mind as long as they have the right amount of money.Maps are often about evil terrorists trying to bomb deserted places. Vandalism is a very serious crime in the Counter-Strike series, so elite Counter-Terrorists are deployed to stop them. Unfortunately for the Terrorists, they are dumb and only packed one bomb. However, the Counter-Terrorists do not know how to pick up a dropped bomb, so the Terrorists can still pick it up after it is dropped by a fallen friend.In some maps, the terrorists have kidnapped a janitor and low-level desk jockey in a building. The Counter-Terrorists have been deployed to save one, not both, of the hostages. In reality, this is just a thinly-veiled excuse for the CTs to murder the Terrorists while pumping rounds into the invincible hostages. One weird thing about hostage maps is that you can purchase a "Hostage Rescue Kit", which somehow makes gives you the ability to put a grown man on your shoulders in a second. Perhaps it is a spell scroll that allows hostages to hover to your character's shoulders. Overall, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a surprisingly solid game about people with the worst gun handling abilities ever seen on Earth. Even though your characters have the aiming abilities of someone with Parkinsons Disease, you have many tactical options that make the game very fun and dynamic. It's worth picking up.

.Erin.	Recommended	562.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Erincl/	Counter Strike: Global OffensiveCounterstrike is a game that slowly ravages and pulverizes your soul each and every time you play it. Everyone starts with the same thoughts when they play CS:GO: 1) 'Pfft. I'm never going to spend money in game buying skins and keys, that's stupid'2) I'm never going to get that angry, it's only a game. 3) 'Meh, doesn't look that hard'Within a month -Within a week - 1) You’ve already have bought a P90 module skin because "Oh, It's only 30p" and you begin your slow downward spiral into the CS:GO marketplace, saving up for a knife and opening crates, in hopes of getting a knife which (deep on the inside, deep deep down) you know you're never going to get, and end up spending £10 opening crates, and getting back 50p worth of skins back.  2) You’ve probably already threatened a handful of people with their lives; it’s a game that can turn any lovely human being into a soul eating behemoth within minutes of a match starting.  Get used to wanting to assassinate everyone in your near vicinity. 3) You'll already gave uninstalled the game at least twice, in utter exasperation and in utter hope of cleansing your life from this game. But you can't, you'll always go back.The community is utterly merciless and beastly, with over half the people being angry 12 year old Russians. The betting will completely waste you and rip you of all of your favourite 50p worth of skins. And the trading is completely unreliable, leaving you to deal with steam support, which is 10x more brutal than the game itself. But of course you’ll go back, it’s CS:GO, it’s a drug. A soul destroying, mind numbing, murder spree inducing drug.EDIT: HA. Oops.
get fuckin greased	Recommended	707.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sixty-eight/	You want buy this game ? I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??
sini	Recommended	1,224.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/siniseenee/	I'm bored and have slow internet. Might as well make a review. I don't even know if this IS a review.> spends 1 hour writing this> nobody reads> :cCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is a pretty great game.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=- First things first, the basic rules.In CS:GO, you have the choice to play five official gamemodes:-Arms Race-Deathmatch-Demolition-Casual-Competitive-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Summary of gamemodes: In Arms Race, the player gets weapons not by the money, but by killing people. Each two kills get you a new weapon. At the final stage of the weapon, you will get the Gold Knife. Kill someone with it, and you win.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Deathmatch, yes. In Deathmatch, it is like a "warm-up" or "practice" mode. For me, at least. In this gamemode, you join a server, and you just kill everybody you see, except your teammates. You can get weapons for free. There are also random occasions in which the game will tell you that a weapon currently has bonus points, and if you want to use that particular weapon, you press g by default. The person who gets the most points, wins.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-So next in the list, is Demolition. It is set to be a 5 vs 5 match. It also has 20 rounds. The first team to get 11 rounds wins, and it can even finish with a tie. In the first half, you play as a set team. In the second, you play as the other team. You cannot buy any weapons, but instead, you get weapons by killing people, just like in Arms Race. Money is also not rewarded. But this is different: let's make a scenario. In (Round 1), you kill an enemy. the weapon will be rewarded to you on the next round. But what if you kill two in one round? You still get to advance to the next weapon, but you get a bonus grenade. For example:2 kills: next wep + bonus grenade3 kills: next wep + 2 bonus grenadesGet the pattern? Yeah. -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-What next? Oh, yeah. It's Casual. Casual is a 10vs10 game, with 15 rounds. The first team to get 8 wins, wins the match. It is split into two sub-gamemodes: Bomb Defusal (IIRC), and Hostage. Sorry, I don't know the exact names. In Bomb Defusal, there are two bomb sites. A and B. The Counter-Terrorists always have the Defusal Kit equipped, even if they didn't buy it. The kit shortens the defusal time from 10 to 5 seconds.The terrorists can freely choose which site they want to plant in. The bomb, iirc, has a 45 second timer. When defusing / planting the bomb, it makes a noise. Of course, the CTs are trying to stop them.Counter-Terrorists can win in two ways: killing all of the Ts before they plant the bomb, or defusing the bomb.For the terrorists, it's the same: killing all of the CTs, or making the bomb explode.So in Hostage, the roles are switched: the terrorists are now the defending side, and vice-versa. As the gamemode says, the Ts are holding some people hostage. And it is up to the CTs to get the hostages, or kill all of the Ts.-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-Finally, competitive.The competitive gamemode is much like the Casual gamemode, except a few differences:- Each kill has 2x more money reward than in Casual.- Defusal Kits / Rescue Kits cost money, and they don't get equipped automatically for free.- It's a 5v5.- Competitive has 30 rounds.- Each half has 15 rounds, and in both halves, you get to play as CTs and Ts.- Like the Demolition Gamemode, the match can end in a tie.- People are much more serious.-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-So, here is my thoughts.CS:GO offers a large variety of gamemodes, and you can just see that I've written about all of them. Phew, that took a lot of time. Anyway, CS:GO is a very entertaining game, and each match has a different experience. Yes, CS:GO can be a bit too serious, but it is also a fun game. The community is not just a single person, you know. There are people who don't like you, and some don't care, but some will make your day better.GO is a game with a high skill ceiling. There is a huge learning curve to go in this game. It's like chess. Easy to learn, hard to master.I've met a huge amount of my friends in CS:GO, and I still talk to them. Some, I don't. Yeah. They'll be grumpy at times, but they inspire me. There are some bugs in this game, but not too gamebreaking. Just a few small ones. Don't expect to enjoy this game if you have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ internet. Ping matters. I hope you know that CS:GO is available for consoles, too. In fact, VALVe talked about having cross-platform multiplayer, but that would be unfair for the console players, cause they have a delay in controls. I am 100% sure that VALVe completely abandoned Global Offensive in the console. The competitive scene is pretty huge, too. And a tournament even reached more than a million viewers! Online and in the tournament itself. It's only two years old, and it's already a big game. VALVe may not be the most listening, but they try. Except sometimes they make some aspects of the game turn to♥♥♥♥♥♥ Like the AWP. They reduced the movement speed while scoping.There are also skins in CS:GO. Some care about it, some don't. Just a matter of personal preference. I think they're part of why this game is popular.The most negative opinion I have, though, is about the Competitive gamemode. Sure, "no game is perfect", and the real fun is there, yeah, but the banning system needs some stuff to be taken care of. You know, just a few tweaks, like forgiving a person if he accidentally kills someone. It is pretty unforgiving. For who doesn't know, you can get banned for killing a teammate too many times, or leaving the game. If someone abandons your team, you can surrender.Not permanent bans, though.The VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) System also needs some fixing to be done. Some cheats aren't fully detected, so the hacker doesn't get VACed. From my experiences, I still haven't encountered a hacker, but that's probably because I'm a Silver. Some people can be real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.So that's my review. Hoped you like it!EDIT: I missed a few points, thanks > SKaREOAbout the netcode of CS:GO, truth be told, it HAS been really bad... for a few weeks now in fact. I go up to a guy and spray him, but most of the time it registers 2 or 3 hits out of 8 for example which could be lethal. Take note, that's in close quarters. No, that's not horrible aim. In the words of a truly horrible player, "omfg 64-tick sucks volvo pls 128-tick". Eh, doesn't really suck, just... well, mixed?In Global Offensive, there are a few advantages. Some on the T side, and some on the CT side. Hm, what's it called? Yeah, the perspective. Take this for an example, the "left shoulder advantage". | http://i.imgur.com/kVpjg.jpg?1 | Here's an explanation: the player models hold guns on the right side. Therefore holding angles or peeking with left shoulder is more favorable as your model is less exposed. TheWarOwl has this video to make advantage of your perspective: | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5e8HZqF3cyk | And that's well-- unfair. Just like in real life, should I see your eyes, you will see mine, too.As I said earlier, VAC needs some fixing. It's terrible. But again, I still haven't played with any cheaters, so I can't fully review this part yet. Thanks.Final conclusion: an EXCELLENT game. There's bugs and glitches, but it's a fine piece of work. Go get it if you haven't already have it. Already do? Well what're you doing reading this review? Go play!BTW: CS:GO has gotten an update where the voice chat quality has improved.Thanks valve!TL;DR: ayy lmao 10/10♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ -================================================-
//#include<studio.h>	Recommended	118.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Joevin_Lui/	Counter Strike : Global Offensive, perhaps one of the most famous first person shooter till this day.Here are the things worth mentioning about this game.This is the review in a nutshell.Pros :-A game focused on team play-Reappearance of maps and weapons-Competitive play and ranking system-Custom servers-Market-A high skill ceiling game----------Problems :-Hit-Registration problem-Inconsistency on the VAC system and concerns about cheaters and scammers-Lack of casual play with competitive game settings (5v5 unranked casual)-Competitive mindset and player base-(Negligible)Blunt and plastic gun sounds-(Negligible)Does not support Steam Pipe---------Review in details :-Pros : A game focused on team playA fine combination of map geometry, weapon balancing, grenade usage and money management, this game requires the 5-man team to communicate with each other to defeat the enemies, which is why this game is popular among E-Sports.-Pros : Reappeareance of maps and weaponsIf you are a Counter Strike fan, you will like this game. You will visit some of the maps originally featured in Counter Strike 1.6 and Source, completely remastered with the modern day graphics and details. You will also get to hold some of the beautiful guns featured in earilier games, such as the AK, the M4, and the AW.-Pros : Competitive play and ranking systemThis game is a competitive game, so people you will be facing will be tough and not willing to give up, you will have to use your muscle memory to control your fire and your wisdom to outsmart your enemy, as well as communication between your team.If you like glory, then you will like this game. This game features a ranking system which fluctuates according to your performance in a competitive match. The Global Elite Rank (the highest rank) is perhaps everyone's dream, or for modest people, to become good at this game.If you also wish to be a part of the E-Sports, this is the game you deserve. CSGO in E-Sports is a big thing nowadays.Otherwise, if you wish to be isolated from the competitive scene, you can play some casual gamemode like Arms Race, War Game, Casual, Wingmen.-Pros : Custom serverModding is considered the afterlife of a game. Even though the game does not support steam pipes, it still allows servers with custom rules.Many community-made gamemode have reappeared on the server list, such as Zombie Escape, Jail Break, Death Run, Surf, and many more worth playing.-Pros : MarketNot only you can have fun in CSGO, you also have the chance to make money out of this game. CSGO is known for one of the reason being the weapon skins. These skins are rare in the game and some of them worth a lot. If you wish to make money in the meantime, this game is for you.-Pros : A high skill celling gameThe weapon system is a hard to master game element. After shooting the gun for a long time, the gun will point above the crosshair and makes your shots in places you don't want them to be. By memorizing the spraying pattern and have muscle memory, you will have a significant advantage over the enemy since recoil handling always results in either winning or dying.Other than guns, you will also need to depend on grenades to gain advantages over the enemy. Not only do you have to know about when to use them, but also where to use them. Studying the map is always important since you have to position yourself according to the weapon you are holding and where you are attacking/defending.That's why this game recieved the popularity it deserves.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Problems : Hit-Registration problemPerhaps one of the main concerns for seasoned players. Sometimes what players see aren't what the server sees, and thus where they're aiming and standing isn't entirely the same. This is because most of the MatchMaking servers are in 64-tick instead of 128-tick, something directly related to the players' aiming and movement. Therefore, where the players are aiming is less consistent for the servers and the players sometimes miss their shot even when they thought hit the target.Unless Valve upgrade MatchMaking servers to 128-tick, the problems will still persist and can potentially ruin certain people's games.-Problems : Inconsistency on the VAC system and concerns about cheaters and scammersThis game is notoriously known for the large amount of hackers willing to pay money for the sake of winning competitive game, and the VAC system is considered inconsistent and useless by pretty much everyone, so cheaters are unavoidable. Be prepared when playing competitive games, and report any cheaters immediately.Marketing in a video game also means scammers doing various tricks to "steal" money out of people, CSGO is one of them. With some of the item worth up to 500USD, you will risk suffering greatly if you're not careful with trading.-Problems : Lack of casual play with competitive game settings (5v5 unranked casual)The official Casual gamemode requires you to play in a 10 vs 10 match, the other gamemodes include Deathmatch and Arms Race do not use competitive game settings. This may be a problem if you wish to train yourself for competitive play without risking losing ranks. (which I don't really care about losing ranks)-Problems : Competitive mindset and the player base.No one wants to lose ranks (i.e. glory). So people in competitive gamemode will do anything to win (and not in a good way), from cursing and swearing at their opponents, to kicking their own teammates for their disappointing performances in game. There will be a lot of flames going off in this game, don't set off a bigger flames by doing the same thing to them. Instead, ignore or mute them.-Problems (negligible) : Blunt and plastic gun sound.I really enjoyed the gun sound of the older version of the game, but to "reduce ear fatique", the gun sound has been forcefully changed from familiar and satisfying sound of guns into something I really don't like to hear, which is disappointing because gun sounds are something I wish to enjoy in games.-Problems (negligible) : Does not support steam pipe.Unfortunately, unlike other Source games, CSGO does not support user modding except for custom player model used in custom server. For modders like me, I can't mod the game the way I want even when in community servers.And yes, you can't change gun sounds.ConclusionSo is this game good? Definitely yes, it is a perfect game for competitive play and it is a game enjoyable.But the problem isn't the game, but the playerbase and the developers themselves.

maxim	Recommended	8,789.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bananagaming/	This review will probably trigger butthurts because it's going to focus on the positive things I have to say about the game, you have been warned. Global Offensive (CSGO) is the latest addition to the Counter-Strike franchise and it's also the best-selling one so far. I believe that there are four reasons for it's main success. The first reason is primarily because it greats new players well to an environment already filled with veterans. A great example is the games matchmaking system for competitive players which places you with others that are the same skill level. It seems to work very well from my experience, but it's definitely more comfortable to play with friends (just like any other team-based multiplayer game).The second reason is how well they managed to implement new weapons and features to the game without destroying it's original charm. It's still the same game from 1999 but with slightly more diversity and variation which enhances the experience. The physics of the game adds more depth overall and allows you to throw coordinated smokes and other grenades which adds another layer of gameplay. The third reason is that watching professional teams and matches is engaging and fun. The built-in tools for spectating like for example x-ray makes it very easy to understand, even for someone that doesn't play the game. And yes, you will often find e-sport fans that prefer watching rather than playing because of the viewer satisfaction you get.The fourth reason (and this is a big one) is the ability to customize your items appearance, thanks to a community driven workshop and marketplace. A vast majority of the community is busy buying and selling skins and other cosmetics because it can actually become profitable in the long-run, and uses real money.You will get weekly or monthly updates which usually add, change or fix features, and sometimes an operation which introduces items and maps made partly by the developers, but more importantly by the community. Even if the game is heavily criticized by most, I still see it's charm for being what it is and I recommend this to anyone that likes team-based shooters.TL;DR Game matches your skill with others, it has new weapons and features compare to the older releases while still retaining it's originial charm, watching a proffesional match is fun and there's a marketplace with virtual items that you can buy/sell/trade for real money.If you want tips and tricks, I have a YouTube channel where I focus on tutorials:youtube.com/bananagaming

Garuda	Recommended	640.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004110037/	When I was young, tragedy struck my neighborhood when a bomb went off in a local park. I lost my dear uncle in that accident. Along with my pet cat, two hamsters, one very courageous gold fish, my tickle-me elmo doll, and all of my foil Yu-Gi-Oh cards. It was the first time I experienced tragedy and despair, feelings that cut so deep I vowed to exact revenge upon whoever did this.I trained every day, running 25 miles a week, lifting weights in 15 pound increments, taking protein supplements as well as spending the majority of my weekends at the firing range. I enlisted in the military, only to be turned down because I was "only a kid."Then, I discovered Counter-Strike;Global Offensive. A perfect simulation of the events I wanted to prevent and take action upon, I was hooked immediately. I threw away my running sneakers for wool socks and sweatpants, as well as a swiveling chair. I put down my weights and protein supplements for Taco Bell and Instant Noodles. I stopped visiting the fire range and instead purchased a Razer gaming mouse.Worth.My uncle's still dead though.

Hydroiix csgoatse.com	Recommended	951.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154147727/	You want to buy this game ? I'm gonna show you somes tips for playing :- Before the match starts, don't press accept. It's a test. - The P in P90 stands for Pro. Like you. - When told to pick up the AWP, stare at it and go AFK. - Don't buy kits, this is actually team death match, the bomb wont ever get planted. - You are amazing with the desert eagle, don't let anyone ever tell you different, not even the scoreboard. - Very important: That thing attached to some guns is called a silencer, and you have to take it off because it reduces damage a lot and will get you more kills. - VAC is a good anti cheat. - Skins make you better at the game. - When a teammate asks for a drop, drop them your handgun. - Never adapt to the game. Don't betray yourself like that. Just do the same thing over and over again and wait until it works. - Dust 2 is the only map in the game. There aren't any others. Don't argue. - If you lose the first round. You MUST ALWAYS Eco/Save. Which means buy armour and an -SMG/Shotgun of your choosing. - When going through doors, always make sure that you block the doors so no one can pass. - -- Ignore the hate of your teammates, you're pro and you're gonna get mad kills. You're also shielding them from bullets. How nice of you! - Crouching doesn't improve accuracy, but do you know what does? Jumping! Be a ♥♥♥♥ing kangaroo and watch the mad kills pour in. ♥♥♥♥ EVERYONE LOVES KANGAROOS. 50 points to Gryffindor every time you change weapons. - State that all SMG's take skill to use from no less than 4 inches away. Your gun is cheaper so it is worse. Rub it in with a teabag afterwards. Especially if you have a P90. - Always tell the opposing team to good luck and have fun when warm-up ends. At half time, treat them like they murdered your family. (Be sure to take note of their nationality!) - If you see a chicken in your gameplay, you absolutely must under any circumstance, kill that damn chicken. It must die. THIS IS NON NEGOTIABLE. - Recoil control is a myth. Like Bigfoot.- If you need to get around the map in a hurry, get out your Negev. - The PP-Bizon is the discount Negev. - Don't waste money on a helmet. $350 is too expensive. You wont die. Ever. - You need to Look at the ground where you are going make sure you don't trip! What the ♥♥♥♥ is strategy??
Datsuke	Recommended	1,748.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LeDatsuque/	**UPDATED REVIEW (05/05/2018) LOOK BELOW **Ok, I think is time for me to write a honest review for this gameCounter-Strike: Global Offensive is one of the most broken and unfair games I've ever played...but I still love itWhy? well let me tell yaI've had some many feelings while playing this game that I've never had before like desperation with anger, rage,  happiness, sadness, adrenaline, etc.This game became a part of my life, I've met most of my best friends in this game, one of the most important relationships I had was built in this game. I've met every kind of person, the one that rages every second, the leader bottom frag, the Canadian, the Mexican, the Australian, the adult with kids, the kid, the furry, very nice people, the most annoying people I've ever met in my whole life, the smurf, the carry, the bad team, the great team, the ''grill'' and the list goes on.Valve makes changes without any previous advice to the players, and they make changes to the very keys of the game, like the rank system, a whole map, the gun recoil, the sounds of every gun, the whole sound system of the game, prices of some in-game items, and the community usually gets mad at it at first, but we get used to it anyways.What do I mean with ''unfair'' and ''broken''?Well, in matchmaking (prime or non-prime) you're gonna find a smurf, a hacker, a whole queue of griefers, derankers etc,Valve tries to stop this, but I personally feel they're giving up which is really annoying.Another example for broken will be the rank system, is so weird and unfair for some players, when you're Nova II sometimes the other team could be Nova master or Silver elite, or a weird mix of those ranks, it took me around 160Hrs to get out of Silver after the rank system update, even if I had good perfomance, no rank up for a loooong timeIf you're thinking about buying this game, you should totally start with a friend, is more fun in general, but if you're a very first time player joining a competitive game, I can't promise that your team is gonna be the most patient in that game, usually some players demand people that already know all the tactics and recoils, without knowing that you gotta start somewhere, but if you find a group of people that is patient and most important of all if they help you to improve your game, you should stick with them and play together more often. But don't think you'll always play with them, trust what I'm telling you, most of these people meet others and move on, but if you have a long term friendship with someone like that, you're incredebly lucky. now Datsuke, all those things doesn't sound very appealingWell, maybe in paper they don't, but after experiencing a good game, after experiencing clean headshots, long range noscopes, carrying a team, a grenade kill, seeing a hacker getting VAC banned mid-game, clutching the round, getting a kill through the smoke, being called a ''hacker'' for your skill, laughing with your teammates is the most satisfying things ever, winning a close competitive game knowing that you perfom well gives you a huge feeling of success making you play more and more. Besides, you meet very different people, you listen a new accent every day, you learn a new word or a internet term every day, you learn something new in general. Other thing I love about this game is that, learning, there's always something new to learn in every map, every gun, a new position, a new boost spot, a new flash, a new smoke, a new prefire spot. I have 1,400Hrs right now of play time, and I think I don't even know the half of the smokes in Mirage. So yea, this game is really good, most of the time, you're gonna see yourself ragging every now and then, but personally I think is worth it-Datsuke 1/29/2017----------------------------------------------------------------------------**UPDATE**Okay, it's been more than a year from my original review,Have I changed my thoughts?.. Sort of.The game haven't recieved much love from Valve, and Prime matchmaking is still in beta,about Prime matchmaking, for some reason the lobbies always default to trust factor which is horrible, and to my knowledge you cannot make it Prime as default (correct me if I'm wrong).The community is pretty much the same, nothing has changed on that note.Now, I have more complains on matchmaking:I used to think that the game itself is broken, I really did, I thought that the hitboxes were messed up (which I have a video example of that, that I recorded myself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0jIfWjd2BE watch it if you wish) but really what is really broken are the matchmaking servers, how do I know this? Well, I been wanting to take the game a little more serious, so I signed up for ESEA which is a paid suscription to other servers that are basically competitive games, the difference here is that the matchmaking servers are 64 tick and the ESEA servers are 128 tick, which is a world of a difference, everything is more accurate when is about headshots and all of that good stuff, and I believe ESEA has more servers so my ping on matchmaking is usually 60-80ms on ESEA servers is around 20-35ms. On ESEA the ranking isn't **AS** broken as matchmaking and the community on ESEA takes the game pretty seriously and don't mess around, which I really like that, however the problem is that it is a paid suscription which not everyone is willing to pay, so there's also FACEIT which provides the same service as ESEA but for free, however Faceit has premium features but payment is not obligated to play.So, the game is pretty much the same, not many fixes or changes going on, but I wanted to update this review since these third-party services change the game experience dramatically and make the game generally more enjoyable, so give those a try and they make help you like the game a little more, at least it worked for me.-Datsuke 05/05/2018

"I must get to my family!" said the father chicken.  Navagating through all the stained karambits and battle-scarred asiimovs will prove quite the challenge.  As the chicken creeps up the stairs into apartments he sees the glass shatter in the first room to his right.  He scatters down the hallway anxious of what will happen next.  There are 3 mysterious people wearing potato sacks on their head and must have applied way too much eye shadow.  He sneaks past them and makes it into the crawlspace.  "I can't believe it! I may actually live to see my family on B site fishing in the koi pond."  AWP shots are being exchanged down the middle of the battlefield and the chicken hears flowerpots shattering here and there.  As he gets to the exit of crawlspace he sees another potatosack creature hiding behinds a haystack and scuttles down into banana.  "Who the hell drove a taxi down here?" says the chicken.  He makes it down the dark ally and glances over to see the remains of his family.  They are but feathers floating in the burnt sushi in the pond after a thrown molotov.  "I.. I.... I can't belive thi-BOOM-."  A cheeky CT sits in his spawn with an AWP as he giggles in his chair after murdering the poor creature in cold blood.  Please, I beg of you, these chickens are endangered creatures and risk thier lives to venture through the city just to meet thier family again..

A game recommended for players with "First Person Shooter" experiencePros+ Game Mechanics is not like other games    + Different weapons with a totally different weapon recoil    + Running and gunning with rifles don't work that well    + No aim down sight on most weapons (sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)    + No prone (again sorry Call of Duty and Battlefield fans)        + in result, difficulty in simplicity+ Needs a lot of skill and variety of play styles+ Competitive+ Always room to improve+ Team game (communication and strategies)+ Fun with friends+ A huge variety of different weapons to choose from+ A huge variety of fun workshop mapsCons- Hard for new players    - Smurfs (people that are way more experienced teamed against inexperienced players)    - Variety of maps, and game modes to learn               - Call outs: names of parts of the map to learn              - A lot of map knowledge required- Frames Per Second drops, uncommon. (Lag)- Hackers (Cheaters) => [They eventually get banned, loss won't count against you]- Community can get annoying or frustrating at times (uncommon 0-2/20 players per game)- Limited of servers, Europe plays with Russians that cannot speak English.- Maps tend to be CT sided. (slightly) Any further questions about the game?

+jet1ce-	Recommended	2,097.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jetice/	Beautiful game. First bullet accuracy of rifles is completely perfect, as is the miniscule RNG factor which doesn't affect anything at all.Dedicated servers with more than 10 people don't have hit registration or choke/latency issues in the slightest.Community is filled with mentally stable, rational, humble players dedicated to having fun while improving, not merely ranking up and flaming enemies and/or teammates. VAC is literally flawless on this game, never before have I encounted someone who I think twice about being absolutely 100% legitimate.CS:GO developers have truly pruned this game into the best FPS of all time with their consistent efforts into listening to the community, bringing regular updates, game balancing patches and exciting new operations into Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.Also goes well while coming down from a weeklong amphetamine induced psychosis. Never before has yelling at a computer game been so thrilling!

[Sweet ♡] - discord.gg/NayBN3W	Recommended	1,161.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sweetmisa/	Most cancerous and stressful game I've ever playedI have nothing against this game, I find it fun at times but I believe the title I choose above suits the game overall very well.List of pro/con of this game:Cons:- There are a bunch of ragers in this game that rages whenever a round is lost, or you don't follow their command.- There are a lot of salty and trash talkers in this game. Some teammates call you names from r*ta*d to f4g and whatever curse words you can think of.- Sometimes teammates gang up to bully one teammate specifically because the teammate is "ret4rd3d" or "bad" player.Pros:- Fun if you're into competitive gaming. But be sure to be thick-skinned as I listed above, many ragers and salty people in this game.- Skill-based game. Skins and levels do not give you advantages in this game.- There is always something new to learn from new strategies to learning nade spots, gun spray control, etc. Even after hundreds or thousands of hours, there is always something new to learn.

3kliksphilip	Recommended	3,338.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/	CSGO is a near-perfect multiplayer shooter. Unlike the previous versions, which were often difficult to get in to, this one offers a variety of modes that will appeal to all skill levels. It has a large community and a well supported workshop, ensuring that this discount-priced game will be around for years to come.In short, you either play as the good or bad guys and must either kill the other team or complete objectives to win the round, which will earn you more money to do the same thing again but faster. It's been around for years and has spawned many imitators.The game isn't much of a looker as it is based on the same engine as the original Half Life 2 was. However, Valve have polished it as much as they can and the community consists of lots of awesome mappers who have been churning out brilliantly imaginative and beautiful maps almost on a daily basis.Is it worth getting if you already own Counter Strike: Source? Yes. CSS was always Counter Strike shoe-horned into the Source engine. CSGO feels far more like a standalone game. Valve have very carefully listened to what people have wanted and have made a very appealing game. The best feature must be the competitive play. You cannot leave these matches or you'll suffer a temporary ban from the feature. After 10 wins in this mode you'll be ranked and will be paired up with people of the same skill, meaning that the game is challenging but fair regardless of your skill level. These matches are exciting, occasionally scary or frustrating, but are the most rewarding part of the game and improving your rank is one of the most satisfying experiences in any video game, ever.There are all kinds of teams and communities that you can join. Really, if I was stuck on a desert island with one game this would most likely be my top choice. It's bigger than you can hope to conquer and has a huge community around it which will likely be around for years to come, something that can't be said for the Call of Duty franchise which is probably its closest rival. Remember that those games are full price and have another one churned out each year, fragmenting the community. Plus you can customise your weapon skins in CSGO. Surely that's the most important feature?! All they need to add now are hats and you might as well live in CSGO.

When playing the  game,  I realised that not every map has chickens on it, so I slowly got angrier with the game... The lack of chickens boiled my blood. CSGO made me angry, Until, I found my dream love, Deathmatch. A Chicken on any map, right then.. I'd kick the bots, and chase  the chickens around for hours. Ah, It was so pleasurable, How I would do it for hours on end. The chickens are perfect.  I play this game for hours on end, and the chickens never disapointment me now,  Oh Chickens, how you are my one true love. I can't focus at school anymore..  I only think about chickens, on the way home from school there is a KFC, I walk past it every day, I think of chickens, One time, I literally stopped, and took a fap to one of the  chickens. Ah,  It was so good. ChickensI love themOh ChickensTHANK YOU GABEN5/5 I love chickens.

Shizza	Recommended	689.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shxzza/	This game has a feature were you can turn $2.50 into 10₵!Then you bet that 10₵ skin you just got on CSGO lounge to try and make your money back, but then lose the bet.Outraged you decide to buy another key, hoping that this will make up your money by pulling a knife, only to find that you got another 10₵ skin.Hundreds of dollars later, finally you think you have learnt your lesson, to not buy keys and decide to buy a skin straight off the market for full price.Being still resonably new to the game, you click the unknown link, unaware of what is going on, you later realise that you have been scammed. Thats right that skin you bought, more expensive then the game, and all 10₵ skins you have purchased for $2.50 are gone.Outraged once again, you start this process all over, this time knowing the chances of you pulling a knife and making your money back are extremely, slim, but you feel that this will be the one, lol nope get rekt son, 69₵ skin.

Valve did this to prevent scams, gambling, etc. but Valve gave a chance to scammers because ppl dont want to wait for a week to sell their items and they will start to trade with real money transactions. Also they said that for preventing gambling but that will never fix gambling problem because these sites will do balance system so you will play with balance. The good thing is they dropped their email to get feedback. We need to wait until a new announcement.

rip yigo	Not Recommended	1,771.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yigo1337/	It's legit one of the worst games of all time. (I rate it 1/10, even that's too high)Let me explain why:- The anti-cheat systemThere is no need to explain how bad it is. It's so bad, that people are getting banned instantly for using skinchanger, but a friend of mine got OVERWATCH banned (not even vac) 7 (!) months after he started cheating. Good job valve. Oh btw, it was a public hack, he didn't even pay a single cent for it.- The communityIt's cancer overall. Seriously, so many people in the community are either toxic, can't speak English, or are just trolling around and thinking that's fun. I lost so many ranks and matches just because some c*nts don't speak any language or don't even speak at all (yes, there are people who don't even talk to you). If you kill someone in a cheeky way, you are called a cheater instantly. - The matchmaking systemLet me explain it: You are playing with 4 other people (which can be your mates aswell if you queue with them) against 5 opponents. Basically, it's meant to be competitive. But in some cases the matches are so one-sided, that it makes you rage so hard that your neighbours call the police at 2 a.m. Ranking up takes up to 17 wins in a row (I had to win 17 games in a row to rank up to global), but you can rank down 3 ranks after a lose (happened to a mate of mine). It's absolute bullsh*t, and don't even bother trying to play.- The servers64 tick, extreme lags, hitreg and server delay are enough cancer. But there are some bugs which are so weird and wtf that it's ?? For example, there used to be a glitch that if you spammed a buy bind, that you spawned as a spectator. IN MATCHMAKING FFS. If there are such glitches and volvo still doesn't care and add sh*tty gloves, you know that it's over.- Valve itselfAs mentioned earlier, they don't give a sh*t about anything the community says. They used to care about the community back then in 2013, when skins weren't even added yet.In 2014, they added the CZ-75. It was legit better than rifles. For 300 dollars... A pistol... It took them 8 months to nerf it, until it was nerfed to hard that it was rekt completely.In 2015, they added the revolvo. It was a pocket awp. It had the same stats as the awp, before it was nerfed 2 days later. After this, it was clear that valve doesn't give a sh*t about anyone. They kept adding stuff like graffitis, gloves, new skins...In 2017, they still don't care about anything. They "UPDATED" the negev. Great update.In conclusion, please don't play it. It's not worth your time.

SWAG.Brownie	Not Recommended	519.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bulletproof121/	I've held this view of CSGO for quite some time, but have never found the time or motivation to publish my thoughts. I've been playing CS for many, many years - starting in the early 2000's through to present day. This time has seen me enjoy the game as a causual scrubber camping hostages, enjoying leveling my character in WC3 mods, smashing heads in deathmatch, surfing backwards, long-jumping, bhopping, played in quals for WCG, competed in CEVO and flew to different locations to compete competitively with my team in different tournaments. I've enjoyed CS from 1.1 to 1.6, CZ, CSS and also CSGO. No, this does not make me a better player than you, and no this does not mean I know everything, it simply means that I have spent a lot of time playing different titles of Counter-Strike, have played competitively and have experienced the good and the bad aspects of different releases.There are a handful of things that really upset me with CSGO, and they upset me more so because these issues still exist two years after I have first played the game. These issues I consider to be game-breaking bugs that make it such a waste of time to play. I enjoy CS because there is a skill curve: if you want to be the best at the game, you simply need to practice and spend more time learning the mechanics of the game than your opponent - This was certainly true in all other CS games I have played, but not CSGO. CSGO feels like it is a game of luck and chance.As the game stands, it is fun to play casually but anything competitively or MM is hampered by issues surrounding core aspects of the game.Hitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when jumpingHitboxes are not lag-compensated to follow the model of a player when crouchingHitboxes do not follow the animation of a player planting the bombAimpunch phyiscally affects recoil and is not lag-compensatedIf you are on > 70ms ping in a 64tick Server, this is how most events will play out:You see an enemy jump, you shoot the enemy and get no hits.You see an enemy continuing to jump peak a spot, you have to time your shoots to shoot where his head is going to be on the next cycle. You shoot thin air, blood appears and you get a headshot killYou see an enemy standing there, you shoot his chest, you get no hit and then he crouches instantly.You see an enemy standing there, you shoot his abdomen and get a headshot (because he was crouching on the server)You see an enemy, shoot first, die and get no hits. Watch the demo back and apparently how it played out was that he shot you first and your player aimpunched and the bullet actually hit the roof.You are hiding in a bombsite and see an enemy planting the bomb. You crouch and take your time and shoot his head 12 times, slowly one by one. You get no hits and die.All of these aspects of the game I consider EXTREMELY game-breaking. The fact that most people reading this will stop and think to themselves, "Yeah, that has happened to me on a number of occasions" just goes to show that the game is fundamentally flawed. In it's current state, the game rewards people for NOT AIMING - aka, "good" players in the game need only aim at the ground, run and shoot and they'll likely get a headshot, because as long as you don't aim AT the model that you see, there is a high likelihood that the server will decide you should have got a hit. The only one of these bugs that existed in Counter-Strike Source (pre-2010 OB update) was the hitboxes on the planting animation.An example of a bug that I do not consider game-breaking, but extremely frustrating, is the spectator glitch where you are not able to spec another player. For some reason, after the last update this bug was introduced and it has now been 3 weeks and there is still no patch or fix for this? A feature so important to the game such as being able to spectate your team has been inadvertently broken, and after 3 weeks there has still been no patch? That is a huge disappointment.People standing outside a smoke will be full view to others with no smoke obscuring them, but the player's screen will be completely black. This was an unintentional meta-change when trying to fix one-way smokes, and this new issue has existed for months now? The game has been changed so much due to this introduction such that people holding a site need only throw a smoke at the choke and will get an infinite advantage as anyone pushing through will have seconds delay before they are ever able to see the people that can see them. Throw a smoke down, wait until it starts to fade, teammate resmokes - rinse, repeat and run down the timer. Retaking a site with anything other than a horrid oponent who can't capitalise on the blind-criple wandering through the smoke is now completely impossible. What a horrible meta change. Why has this not been addressed this was introduced some months ago?3D sound is non-existent in CSGO. It is not possible to tell whether someone is running above or below you, and more often than not difficult to determine whether someone is approaching from the front or behind.This game has so many core issues wrong with it that completely changes the outcome of the game that it is not funny. I find it extraordinary that so many people are able to accept this game with all these issues, and there are few posts on this reddit about these problems. I see many threads upvoted to the top of terrorists hugging each other, but hardly any threads of people discussing the pressing issues which desperately requires patching to make the game both playable and enjoyable.It'd be nice if people were able to draw the dev's attention to these issues and press for a resolution.

Sonozaki	Recommended	282.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Svenozaki/	Love it or hate it. I do both. Story: Police versus Terrorists. You play on either of this sides.Differenced in gameplay: You want to secure something from beeinng blown up or blew it up.Alternative you have to secure hostages or stop the SWAT securering them. Gameplay: Easy to learn but hard to master. Forget about running with an Assault Rifle and give headshots to everyone like in other FPS. For this you have to choose the P-90. No seriously it took some time to know how to control the spray of your weapons.Just pressing the fire button is not enough here. CS is still one of the most skill and game-sense required games.To help you mastering this you can download and play training maps from the workshop.(Smokes,Flashes,Recoil,Aim) Community: Difficult!There are a lot of nice people but also the most toxic guys you can imagine.Stay calm & be friendly (at least try to be).And for the sake of your money do not open any cases!♥♥♥♥♥/10

Honestly, I don't think we can say CS:GO is a game anymore - It's a sport. I fully got into this game through the competitive esport side, watching my favourite teams and players compete is just amazing and I think this has to be the most gripping, exciting sport to watch due the the unpredictablility. You can't deny that Counter-Strike has the best shooter mechanics of any game out there, and the tactical side is genius. Being a skilled aimer does not get you nearly as far as being smart and knowing all of the maps better than your opponent.It really is sad that CS:GO has made such a bad name for itself due to the gambling issues and Valve's lack of cooperation, but somehow it is still one of the most played games on the platform.Counter-Strike excites me and it will 100% excite anyone who gets fully into it, because you can never beat the game.

Kids spamming their mic with trash. When they are dead, they proceed to mic spam positions of the enemy team, but the thing is: kids are stupid and do not know that when you are dead. People will not be able to hear you, only the other dead players.People spamming the chat with "N00b! u suk uninstall game!" in a casual match. Seriously, it’s a casual game; half of the teams are players under rank 3, or players warming up.  As you might have guessed, English is not my native language. I might update this review at some point Edit: So I've noticed in the comment section, that people think I have a problem with this. I don't, its a review, like a heads up for the people who are going to, or consider buying the game, so they are kinda "prepared" for whats ahead of them. I'm perfectly fine with this, jezz guys, I've spent more then 900 hours in game.

But u know what, we have to become a better version of ourselves and don't blame valve for everything i know that they are not trying very hard but u know u and us together we can grow this community more. If u know ur friend is hacker UN-friend him off-course its your choice to do so and yeah reporting works too. And if u r a HACKER AND READING THIS then man!!! go and hack pubg and fortnite bruh!! those games are kind of open world and 99 people to kill im sure you'll have more fun or just play vice city type panzer and go berserk.So, as to increase the community, please guys don't be toxic, if you play well do not think that everyone will play like you. People have problems like PC, internet or equipment issues. And yeah if you are determined to win then go to competitive MM with known people, create a team, i know it isn't easy but you'll find people. But please in case u want only to have fun or only to win then for god's sake don't play solo queue and ruin other people experience. If you r solo queuing than try to adapt to the team. And as a solo queue person you should be able to do it. And most important don't get angry on new people just try to give them directions not everyone who play csgo want to go pro most of the community people want to have a good time with friends and win.And about recommending the game, I highly recommend it.

🌟 taipaN-[CE] 🌟	Recommended	1,368.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968668593/	When I reviewed Counter-Strike Source a few years ago, I called it things like "immortal" and "the definitive multiplayer FPS."The Awp is easily one of the most satisfying weapons in gaming. Quickscoping and noscoping can be a gamble - I really like the balance and precise feel of the Awp.  The rest of the weapons feel really good - there is much more variety here: we are talking custom weapon skins and even a custom loadout for each team.  This is one of the areas where CS:GO shines, and leaves its predecessors in the dark ages.Competitive matchmaking is one of the really nice features of Global Offensive.  The game allows you to play in competitive matches based on your skill level rating. This is done similar to the matchmaking in Dota 2.  While not perfect, I find the matchmaking to be pretty accurate - it is rarely a cakewalk.Always be wary of the player community for this game - this community has some sick and twisted people, tons of trolls, smack talkers, hack accusers, mic spammers, and cry babies, lol.  Fortunately you can mute players, and if you are so inclined, can vote them off the game - nice!Trading and items drops are a fairly big part of the game as well. One of the neat things about the game is you can easily sell back your in game drops via Steam market and basically play this game for free or even profit from it. its insane, but some items sell for legitimate currency.CS:GO is on the rise reaching peaks near 500,000 players.  There are huge tournaments played, and with each passing month the game sees positive growth.  I think its safe to say this is the new "definitive multiplayer FPS"!9/10

✘𝒂𝑅𝒐c𝒂 ッ	Recommended	8,377.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrxarocas/	Counter-Strike is Counter-Strike, between old and current versions, CS always sought the balance between gameplay, performance and visibility. With constant upgrades, always improving a gameplay and a visual version of the game, a valve is pushing itself to the maximum to this, and the result could not be different, one of the most popular and played games in the world! After all it is also a game that runs on any machine!This, Global Offensive, is proof that you do not have to release one version every year, but on the contrary, make it look like old versions with new features and technology that only Valve knows. If you have played a Counter-Strike before, it has a significant improvement in graphics, a well-crafted competitive mode where you play with players who are patent-pending and clear to fully customized servers per community.

Not even possible to relax or play like a casual human.DELETEDValve....Valve.......good luck with DOTA 2 tournaments and mass 7.1 updates instead of fixind your own anticheat.OH YEA, forgot. PRIME.

Spazz1313	Not Recommended	1,953.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Spazz1313/	Pros: -It's a huge e-sport-very well done maps-it has it's own weapons system that's very unique and adds an incredibly high learning curve.-It keeps a classic arcade feel to the game so it's easy to pick upThe game has seen worse times, but even still, it's terribly flawed.Cons:-Unless you're playing in a LAN, where everyone is in the same room, you're going to have tons of hit registration problems.-Valve's 64 tick servers are great for lower ranks from Silver to Master Guardian. But once you get past that, you've probably accumulated some skill and an understanding of the game and how it works. Quite often, while playing a competitive matchmaking, you'll shoot at someones head, see blood, and absolutely nothing will happen in your favor. 128 tick servers exist, but you need to go to a third party to use them, which seems pretty excessive just to play the game with a few less problems.-The community is the most toxic, vile, absurd- you know what. Just get a dictionary and every single word that has a negative connotation will pretty much describe the community that plays this game. -Hackers EVERYWHERE. Hackers are insanely abundant and carry on without a care in the world. They don't worry about getting banned because they have no problem buying the game again, especially if it goes on sale, and just hacking all over again. This is probably the biggest reason Valve doesn't do anything to REALLY try and put a stop to it. But why would they? It makes them money when someone finally does it get banned so who cares about the legit players who try to enjoy the game for what it is, right?-There are a certain number of bugs and exploits that are in the game, that haven't ever really been addressed. For example, a persistant sound bug that sounds like someone is running when in fact nobody is there. (I believe they have fixed the running audio glitch but there are many more issues yet to be addressed.)-The developers put out updates, and just when you think it's something useful, like fixing a bug or exploit that's been making the game unfair, they just add more sounds! Or adjust sound levels! Pretty much nothing that matters to serious players. Conclusion:The game at its core is a decent game. But you can't play it the way it's 'meant' to be played with just the game itself. For actually decent servers, and a SLIGHTLY more tolerable community, you need to sign up with a third party website that hosts their own servers so you can play the game. But those matches don't count for anything in the game itself, it's pretty much just a platfom to work around. If you're going to get the game just for a time killer and don't plan to take it serious then great. But otherwise, don't waste your money or your time.I manage(d) four community competetive servers that are fairly popular, and I used to have a blast playing on them. But now whenever I go into the servers, it usually ends in me having to ban the ENTIRE lobby. I've quite literally yelled about how tired I was of babysitting because that's exactly what I had to do. I'm very accustomed to seeing hackers and cheaters from monitoring so many for so long with my time on the servers so when I play matchmaking matches the hacks are very easy to spot out. 'Professional' players have been banned for hacking before for crying out loud.The first few hundred hours of my gameplay were pretty fun. The learning curve made it challenging and different and that's what I enjoyed. But the higher rank you get and the more serious you play, the more terrible everything becomes. I've made it to Supreme Master First Class, (Rank before Global Elite, highest rank in the game's ranking system.) and I can't say that I want to bother trying to get Global or playing anymore in general. At this point, every other match has a hacker or at the very least a griefer or extremely toxic person that wants to spoil your day. Whether a hacker is blatant or not, it becomes pretty apparent when someone's playing unfairly. All in all, there's no sportmanship or respect in a game that would do extremely well with both of those things, and the lack of feedback from developers in helping clean up the community or create better servers is very unsettling, especially for one of the most popular games on Steam.But you don't have to believe me, play the game and see for yourself. But you've been warned.

Voodoolala	Not Recommended	1,474.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nnzh/	I've played CS.GO for a thousand hours plus. I think, I've clocked in a decent number of hours to offer genuine and reliable thoughts/insights/feedback of the game. If there had to be reasons why i would not recommend this game, it would be for two reasons.Firstly, I have to say that the CS.GO community is horrible. People show no signs of mercy to those who are new (Including myself at times). There are plenty of rude people. Of course i've met really nice people who respect one another but that is just a small minority. Too many people kicking out starters from casual matches for being noob ( not forgetting many times people kick out random players to allow friends to enter the match) and many times sore losers who constantly restart the match just because they died/didnt get a kill/for fun.Secondly, the number of hackers and smurfs that are present now. These people are spoiling the game for those who enjoy some casual FPS and also in competitive mode. Especially for smurfs, I know of many who wish to rank up higher in competitive but simply cant due to the number of smurfs who are actively cockblocking them. And as for hackers, there are those who use it for personal glory or to use it to sell people ranking up services. These people are simply a real pain to the CS.GO community. Need I say more?CS.GO, honestly, is good fun. I do love CS.GO. I have spent many good hours with friends, meeting new people and killing chickens. However the harsh reality of the CS.GO is simply cruel and merciless with people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you're no good, along with a good bunch of hackers/smurfs who ruins your gaming experience.If you cant handle the harshness of the CS.GO community, dont start playing it. However if you choose to enter the CS.GO world alone, good luck. I hope you meet a few reliable and friendly comrades.Until Valve finds a way to counter the problem is hackers and smurfs (especially in competitive mode), I will not recommend it. (Suggestion to counter smurfs: If the IP address has been in a CS.GO server before, he/she will not be allowed to play in the same pool of players in competitive mode.)EDIT: Valve's implementation of having 24 hours cooldown after every 2 wins for fresh competitive accounts is a great effort in slowly down smurfs and catching hackers via overwatch, however i think a more full proof method would be required after once they reached 10 wins.ADDITIONAL NOTE: To the few who have disagreed with my review because 'It's the community you're unhappy about, not the game', here's what i have to say. I strongly believe for a game like CS.GO (in fact any game with multiplayer funtionalities), community is a very large contributing factor if the game is good or not. It is the community that makes the game whole and who it is, especially for a game like CS.GO. I highly doubt people buy CS.GO to play offline mode/bot matches.Though I understand your point of view, and that i should be reviewing the game base on its mechanisms/funtionalities like movement/gun bullet mechanics/matchmaking. However for my review, my aim is to offer my readers a deeper insight to the game than just what you see it on the surface/trailers.At first you might feel that the community doesnt affect you at all, however once you get into the game, i believe you'll change your opinion. If you still disagree, I think its either you havent been exposed enough or you're just darn lucky meeting really nice and legitimate players in your matches. @Shadowdance You're welcome. You gave me the push to write this reply.Cheers fellow comrades.

Nick	Recommended	1,745.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ultranuke42/	First off,Honestly I loved this game, I really did, and I still really do, but come on valve. You lack the care to fix this game because of money, you already screwed tf2 and broke its community, now instead of a mix of little kids and adults, its now all either whiny little kids who cheat (and those are the people who cheat in the game because its free and they want to pretend that they are better yet they are bad), and yet all valve cares about it money. Its basically the same problem with this game. Valve seems to not care enough to fix the problem with cheaters. Since skins and items were developed for the community market the game started going downhill. Now I'm not saying skins are bad, its all just about skins and giving valve your money. Second, Not only do the cheaters♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but so does like 90% of the community. Your teammates are always fighting if you are losing, maybe even if you are winning. On my old account (which I forgot the password to), I played a lot, and when I came back to this game in November of 2016, I was very disappointed. These are the statistics of different types of players (these are basically averaging it out:25% - Little kids who are either annoying squeakers, or mic spam the crap out of the game so you are forced to mute them becuase they are that annoying25% - Grown adults who take the game very seriously who yell at you for making a play that isn't correct, and then they do the same crappy play, yet no one says anything, besides "nice try". 40% - Closet cheaters or super blatant ones, who either call you bad or will not admit to it, because they know they are bad. 10% - Actually non-toxic platers who know how to play the game in their own rank.Third,Let me end this review on a good note since I'm still giving it a positive review already:I do love this game, and I won't mention the pistols being broken because they are "Almost" all fixed, so I'm cool with that. It is a fun game to play with friends if you're looking for an extremely competitive game, and if there weren't as many cheaters/trolls in this game, I believe that this game can keep its legitimate players. Ignoring the fact that Valve doesn't care about the cheaters and trolls, I would say that the game is actually fun. I edited my last 2 reviews because I made them a while ago. I would probably have to give this game a 7.5/10. It used to be good, but now its not as good. (This could change if the game becomes better.) :)Its good i guess
Pain	Not Recommended	3,198.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lord_Pain/	After around 4,000 hours of gameplay since 2013 (also taking into account the hours from my other IDs) I am finally going to update my review from postitive to negative.Pros:+ Great game to play with friends.+ Balanced by competitive ranks.+ Thousands of community server to play on.+ Can make money from skins and operations.+ Fun to watch eSports.Cons:- Very badly optimized, CPU intensive game.- Dumped with hackers even in prime, now even in MG ranks.- New players will encounter cheaters as they will be non-prime when starting CSGO.- Toxic community (make sure you have friends to play with in MM).- Really bad anti-cheat. CS:GO has 10,000+ hacks available which are undetected.I changed it to negative because I am really pis*ed off with the game, literally facing hackers (who are probably noob Gold Novas without hacks) every game. If you think they're just better than me, they all get OW bans within a month. This is been a problem with the game in all the regions, and Valve seems to take no action regarding this. It's just so sad to see third party clients like ESEA and FACEIT having better anti-cheats than Valve, the developers of the game. If you are new, I do NOT recommend you to buy this game.

Senarin	Not Recommended	533.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079811911/	Let me preface this just a bit.I love Counter-Strike. I've met so many cool people over the years I've played, had so many laughs and good times, it's been a blast. However, I'd say about 95% of that was purely through casual. So after 500+ hours in the game, I decided to try and get into the competitive scene. I got a few buddies together and we were gradually progressing through the silver ranks (I know call me bad,♥♥♥♥♥♥ etc.) and we were having good fun. We'd win 3, lose 1, but the point was that it was fun.However, as we got higher and higher up, it stopped being fun. The reason? Absolutely♥♥♥♥♥♥poor matchmaking and security from Valve's end. I can understand one bad game or 2, but it got to the point where it was consitently terrible. At this point I had stopped queing with less than a full lobby. Me and a couple friends would get qued up with people with 900 ping who were basically worse than bots, they'd leave, and then its a 3v5 for the entire match. Experiences like this, are not fun, at all. The worst part though, is the amount of painfully obvious hackers in this game. VAC is the poorest ♥♥♥♥ing excuse for an anti-cheat system I've ever seen. One hacker will basically carry an entire team, and 9/10 times the enemy team won't have the integrity to kick the blatant hacker, because he'll carry them to the next rank. The most you can do is report them, but with how cheap this game is, it's no problem for people to make another account and rinse-repeat. Valve makes more than enough money on this game to justify having a better anti-cheat system. It is honestly one of the saddest examples of a company not giving a♥♥♥♥♥♥about their community that I can think of in the gaming industry. Say what you want about EA being a money hungry ♥♥♥♥♥♥ company that hates their fans, I guarantee you that you won't run into as many hackers on official Dice Battlefield servers than you will an official CSGO server. That's just sad. Again, I love this game. If you want to play casual or community or what have you, you'll probably have a great time learning the quirks of the game, learning the maps, and engaging with the goofy♥♥♥♥♥community I've come to love/hate. However, the competitive scene is pure cancer. I do hope that Valve reads these, even though I highly doubt it, because I truly want what's best for this game. Tks for reading.-Sen
Bjarte [*]	Recommended	1,704.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blinklys/	The game that learns you cuss words in more languages than you can imagine. 10/10 I get tilted and toxic af every time I play it.
Ƥyrefeather	Not Recommended	62.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pyrefeather/	I ignored this game for so long hoping it would get better but it hasn't. It shockingly got even worse.Tl;DR - Toxic community full of cheaters and micro transactions.Before I start lets get into the history of Counter Strike. The Original CS was a fun competitive game that still remains superior to it's sequel, CS:source. CS:source was popular mainly because of the large amounts of custom maps that were flooded into the game but killed competitive CS and turned the game into a casual shooter.Then CS:GO came.  This game was made solely for micro transactions, but to be honest any game made by valve will be from now on. But the game has no major changes from cs:source other than skins and cosmetics. Furthermore these weapon skins and cosmetics feel like something that fits more in tf2. Bright pink guns and meme stickers make me want to vomit. But hey, if you want to spend $300 on a knife skin that you will never use or get a kill on be my guest. Another problem are the guns. None of them are balanced in the game. Most famous one being the awp, the 1 shot 1 kill weapon. And last we have the matchmaking. It is some of the worst matchmaking I have ever seen. Any game where it takes over 5min. to get into a match fails, and cs:go has no excuse seeing as how as of this review it is the second most played game on steam.And lastly the main reason I hate this game, is the community. So I was on a server, everyone was dead. It was me vs. the entire other team and as you would guess, I died. Then some squeaker yells over the mic "what the f#ck you idiot!" and starts a vote kick on me that passed. The other way around happened where I hid in a corner no one checked and shot the entire enemy team and won and I get "You f#cking hacker!" and get kicked.This stuff is normal when you play this game because 75% of everyone playing it is some annoying kid with some kind of meme name. On top of that this game is full of Russians that like to yell. A lot. Now you would think that when you play on a west coast server Russians wouldn't join because bad ping, but they do. And then you would KNOW Russians wouldn't join on an east coast server because it is on the other side of the world and they would get the worst possible ping, but they still do. It's almost as if they are only joining these games so they can yell at people and not play the game at all. 30% of all the nearby servers, at least where I live, are idle servers and even then there aren't that many servers to begin with and it confuses me because this game has pretty much the same amount of servers as tf2 even though there are a lot more people who play this, at least to what steam says in their stats. And lastly this game is full of cheaters. And having a ranking system where you get better ranks depending on your k/d ratio will always make more dumb kids want to cheat. And having next to no defenses against kids cheating because you can almost never confirm if this kid is hacking or just lucky because you pretty much instantly die if you get shot in the head with any weapon.This game it is best used just to idle for the chance of getting a drop you can sell for 30$. With that said I'm done. I would like to remind anyone reading this that this is my opinion of the game and everyone has different opinions. And yes, ik, my opinion is shít and i'm an under-aged-pleb that clearly knows nothing about video games. No need to sprinkle your salt in the comments.
SpaceCat77	Not Recommended	795.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/spacecat77/	Never met a single Russian in multiplayer. Highest rank I ever got was MG2 before the ranking system update and MG1 afterwards for hundreds of hours making me quit this game along with toxic community (smurfs, throwers, queuers that bring lower ranks into matches etc. etc.) Cheating is common no matter the rank due to VAC being useless. After almost 800 hours I do not recommend this game. First I will be adding this onto the review due to the people that just complain in the comment section over my choice. - Say what you want but insults get you nowhere. Calling me a ♥♥♥♥♥ or a snowflake for not liking the game because I didn't achieve a better rank than you just shows to me how high of a pedestal you have put yourself on (I delete those comments that are just insults for now until I stop caring to do so). This is my opinion and you have yours but insulting me and telling me to use third party companies to make the comp. aspect of the game better isn't what I feel should be needed for this popular of a game. I have spent my time and made my decision and this is it.These are my thoughts and I am being as blunt as I feel is needed. Plain ole ghadilli puts it into better words and i'll post them below. "The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts! This game is a broken pile of neglected♥♥♥♥♥♥with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways.Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality."

LemonTree. #Tilterlich	Not Recommended	2,600.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/L3m0nTr33/	Absolutely not recommendable because of the insane ammount of hackers.Today i dropped From Global Elite to supreme and lost 3 games on SMFC against Rage Hacking kids. In one game we were 8:4 ahead and 1 opponent left, joined back 3 rounds later jsut to announce he quickly downloaded a hack. So after he ragecarried the remaining rounds getting 11 MVPs we obviously lost. Don't get me wrong there are some strong players in this game who hit insane shots but with my almost 6 k hours of Counterstrike experience i can tell you that at least 5/7 matches have one hacker +, not even counting the insane amount of players using some kind of radar hack. In fact Valve doesn't even care. Do they try getting rid of the Hacker Problem? No, not really. Instead they keep adding skins and cases you have to pay for. Overwatch function seemed nice in the early state, but watching an overwatch session, you can't hear the ingame voice chat, which pretty much makes it useless. How do you want to hear if some1 keeps playing music ingame, uses a microphone of 1937 or keeps flaming? Or a hacker calling ingame? No, all you can see is a Scoreboard and the PoV of the Suspect, of course  you are not able to switch the teammates. Counterstrike Anti-Cheat is so damn useless, a friend with 1 year programming experience was able to build a hack, which was undetected for over 2 years.Another problem ist the community. Most players below LEM  are queueing with 2+ mates only speaking their own explicit language. So why the hell is there no "Team-Language" Option ingame to fix these kind of things?All in all CS-GO is a  nice skill-based shooter with high potential, being ruined by a company only interested in milking the cow and a highly toxic community. To enjoy this game you would actually need to buy ESEA or just not play any kind of competative matches, which would make cs go kind of senseless.Cheers

You love it while it lasts and you feel great running around shooting people and then ...you start to tripThe trip:There is a smurf in the enemies team who has 4 games and 50 hours but regardless will Ace you silvers as you rush b without even realoding his gun.Then the trip gets worse ands you start to find hackers who trace you through the wall and have snapaim in 0.001 seconds.And then the worst part...the 8 year old kid who slept with your mother...in small doses they are annoying but manageable however they come in swarms of thousands! Found in every game on every server 80% are Russian and they will find your house. Rehab:Then you eventually see what this is doing to you...you have become salty and toxic you got a microphone just so you could scream abuse at your teammates who missed  and got one tapped.So you decide to uninstall the game and do something with your life. At first you might find something to do..maybe your gardening or learning to cook or even some work which you have never before tried finishing.Withdrawal symptoms:But then...you start to feel depressed...everything around you is grey...there are no bomb sights or noobs who will rush out for you to shoulder peek.  You feel...empty.You log on to your computer and  boot up steam and you see it sitting there just...sitting there. You just think to yourself well what can be the harm? So you decide to reinstall it and as its redownloading you just look through all your screenshots at your amazing K-Ds which you can never repeat and that time you knifed a guy and teabagged him before getting shot in the side of the head.

Hacking/cheating is the worst. Seriously this game has a great history of people cheating and Valve tries really hard, but not seeing any improvement since 1999. Even recently professional players are getting caught cheating. I will like to say to Valve, when....... when will you guys stop putting your heads up your asses and start being less lazy on these cheaters. Banning them wont work for♥♥♥♥♥♥ You guys update this game all the time, but these updates are making us have less and less fps and for some reason, creating MORE cheaters. Why do  I have to pay for ESEA just so I can face less cheaters?My suggestions:1. Make this game $39.99 (this will make it harder for cheaters to keep on buying more accounts)2. Go to these hackers website and buy their cheats so you guys can keep your anti cheat updated. (they update this every week or so)3. Make it so their ip address is banned from playing this game. (once a cheater, always a cheater).

deathyy	Recommended	915.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/_deathyy_/	Counter Strike: Global Offensive, the remake of the classic CS games and not to our surprise, the devs did a good job. One of the lovely things about it, that of had not been kept I seriously doubt the game would be as popular as it is currently, it keeps the mechanics from the classic CS and CS:S and adds a few of it's own, that the original CS and CS:S games could have done with. CS’s weak point was always the graphics, the original games were based of the HL1 engine, which I am sure all you are aware is reasonably old, although it’s added a new range of updated maps, including two operations. The most recent being Operation Bravo in which a number of maps were added to the game as DLC. And once again, Valve have decided to take the generous approach to this, an example is that if the lobby leader has the Operation Bravo pass, and no one else does, everyone can play Op. Bravo, good job Valve, you did it again. What was missing/wrong with this game has been fixed by Valve, which is fantastic. Items have been added, you can have gun camos which is an nifty feature, although many think it's turning into TF2, which is a valid point, but Valve need there money, if you take a look at the price of the game, it’s not exactly the same as COD (ew) which has a hefty price tag of £40 ($60 I think) and CSGO managed to do fine at £12, which I think is $15 in the US.Sadly I did not play the original CS, I have however obviously seen gameplay, and watched friends play it. I have played a small amount of CS:S and compared it to CSGO, which was considerably easy, some of the main differences are simply that the problems that those games have/had have been completely eradicated from CSGO which is brilliant. Such as small things that could be exploited in competitive games, such as the saving mechanic. In CS if you die, you lose all your weapons, they will be dumped on the ground for another enemy to come along and pickup, players if they knew they were going to use they would hide away from the enemies, so they would be able to keep there gun for the next around, the problem with this is that they would still get money from doing this, and therefore be exploiting the system in some peoples opinion, it was recently fixed that instead of getting money if you lose and you’re still alive you simply gain $0.The CSGO match making system is an exceptional feature, the ability to play against players that are at the same skill level is much better than being forced to browse through thousands of servers in attempt to find one that suits you with a enemy team you can play against, and it is a fun game for both teams instead of one team getting obliterated by the other. Matchmaking works by waiting till you have 10 wins or 9 wins and a draw on your account before being rewarded with a competitive rank. Here are all the current ranks available in game. http://www.pro-hl.com/images/prohl/csgo_ranks.jpgMany people seem to think that this is like COD, you simply rank up from playing the game, no this is not true. You rank up as your skill improved, if you play well for a few weeks, and you finally get the Gold Nova you’ve been wanting for ages, and then you proceed to play awfully for a long time there is a very likely chance you will be deranked sadly, it’s for the best, you will be matched against players who are around the same skill level.Recently a feature that allowed you to watch your recent games has been implemented into the game, this is in now way “ground breaking” it’s been done by other games before, but they have there issues, although I have not got round to actually trying out this feature I have been told that it appears to be working considerably well. The watch feature is great for those who enjoy re watching those moments of which they pulled of that beautiful AWP shot, or got that 5-kill ace.I would like to say in this final paragraph, of the 250 hours+ I have played of this game I have seriously enjoyed (almost) every moment of it, sure there are some hackers, but you have to make sure to report them and they will be dealt with. All the factors about this game are good, but as all games go by, they have there problems, sure if CSGO has improved graphics that would be nice, and if *breathes in heavily* VALVE WOULD ADD 128 TICK MATCH MAKING SERVERS… this has caused some annoyance for me in match making, if you don’t understand what’s so bad about 64 tick, I suggest you watch this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6u26YTpIF0Anyway, I highly suggest you buy this game, apart from my small rant at the end, and game is fine, good game mechanics, graphics are sort of good, I supposed most of the maps are well balanced, there are a few that I suggest you shouldn’t play though. The game has a small price tag, which I am sure will attract you to it even more, especially when it’s on sale at 75% of!Hope you enjoyed reading my game review of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, and that this assisted you in making the decision of whether to buy the game or not.I would appreciate it if you left a comment about what you thought about this, was is a bad review? Why was that, whats wrong with it?

ForestWolf	Recommended	331.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038132122/	Rating: good (7/10) Introduction Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a First Person Shooter set in a comptetetive scene where two teams battle for an objective. It is a stand-alone follow-up to the famous Counter-Strike mod from Half-Life where terrorists battle the Counter-Terrorists on different locations. Gameplay & Story: 6/10 The gameplay consists of buying weapons and shooting your opponents. Easier said than done actually, since your opponents are either human players sitting on the other side of the world wide web or some AI programmed to shoot you first. CS:GO is for a reason the biggest competetive shooter on the market for years, since it offers great weapon balance, tactical possibilities for teams to approach and a large player base that keeps growning each day. The story behind the game is based on the oldschool Counter-Strike game, where one side takes the approach as terrorists either trying to plant a bomb or protect the hostages and other being Counter-Terrorists either try to protect a bomb site or trying to rescue the hostages held at Terrorist base.  Combat & Challenge : 8/10 The combat is absolutely fluid in CS:GO and there are barely any moments, that you could blame the broken hitboxes or the bad netcode for dying. People tend to rage and blame the bad balance on maps, weapons or programming of the game, however the success of this title proves that it is the best competetive shooter on the market. The challenge in this game is definetely to be able to rise through the ranks in competetive matches, playing against hackers on opposite team or some players on your team that want to teach you some bad words in russian or french. I am always thankful for such opportunities to improve my language skills and consider it just a chance of becoming even better if I did not win the match no matter the team stacks. Reaching Global Elite rank after around 200 hours, I can safely say that it is possible to rise to the top even when the odds are stacking against you. Graphic & Interface : 7/10 The graphic when set to higher settings is actually pretty good, sadly the competetive scene barely allows it since there are certain tricks like setting your resolution lower on purpose to be able to aim better, that crash the feeling of this game in graphical matters. Most of the maps contain some details that make them distinguishable, like certain grapphiti on some maps. The interface is kept simple and almost transparent so that it does not disturb the concentration. Progress & Mini-Games : 8/10 It is possible to consider progress by rising up the account level that comes from simply playing CS:GO in any form, there are forms of rising up your ranking by playing competetive or gathering skins for the weapons you are using or want to sell. Some people actually make money by playing this game and selling the skins on the steam market, so different ways to progress in and outside of the game. The biggest progress for me was improving my hand-to-eye coordination by playing it competetively. Audio & Immersion : 8/10 Each weapon sound is unique for itself, and since the sound plays a great role in this game it is really important to get to know the sounds and be able to distinguish where the shooting is coming from. CS:GO fulfills its task really well. The music is played only in menues and during the highlights. The game music is nothing special, but since you can get/buy music kits to fit your music taste, Valve found a good workaround for not creating amazing music by themselves. Side-Notes This game offers single player, multiplayer and co-op modes that can be played either against other players or AI.This game offers different modes, some of that are just for fun, for example gun mode, while others are played in E-Sports.This game contains steam achievements.This game offers great optimization and updates to technology with time (updating their network code, updating the hit boxes, balancing the weapons). Summary CS:GO has its reasons to be the Number One FPS in the ESL Scene and its popularity is currently only rising. It is great to see that it has not been abandoned by the developers after reaching its peak state, but still keeps getting updated. I would recommend trying CS:GO to every game, just to know what this game is that defines the global FPS market so much and while FPS fans might love it, some might well get turned off by the hardcore players or the cursing and spitting wanna-bes.I hope this review helps you making the decision if its worth buying and installing this game. Rate and leave a comment if you enjoyed reading it.~ForestWolf

Just hacks and pure hacks.People get their account rank boosted by hackers for what?It is meant to be played with team where everyone can enjoy.Worst kind of community there can be which promote hacks and people willingly use them ingame.VAC is so lame it cannot detect anything.Overwatch was meant to put hackers to Justice but community is busy getting boosted and buying stupid skins that they don't bother to see the case which can stop a potential hacker.

Desolater IV	Recommended	141.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/desolater_iv/	 A Very Competitive Tactical Multiplayer FPShttps://youtu.be/ZSUBuYFhMQQ+ Plenty of well designed maps+ Visually very appealing+ Very high player population with great matchmaking that will get you in a game in less than a minute at any time of the day.+ The Arms Race or "Gun Game" mode is a favorite of mine. Essentially every time you get a kill you upgrade to a new weapon which is a lot of fun.+ Nice selection of guns+ Great Sound Effects~  A bit too competitive. People take this game extremely seriously and spend hundreds if not thousands of hours memorizing the map and perfecting their aim. Some might love this, others may hate this aspect. - You die extremely fast in this game, and can not regain health.- Very repetitive. There isn't many game modes, and you mainly end up playing Bomb Defusal (which is basically Search & Destroy if you are more familiar with Call of Duty)- Microtransactions "Skins" which are very costly- I feel like Counter Strike lacks features that other shooters have. ADS (Aiming Down Site), Vehicles, Gametypes, Killstreaks, Leveling / Progression / Unlock systems, destructable environments, going prone, sliding, leaning, etc.- In competitive play, a large portion of time is spent watching others play. After you die, you must wait for the round to finish by spectating others. [keep in mind these are opinions]

.joph`	Not Recommended	3,304.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/joph/	it is no joke, nothing funny about that. every game of matchmaking you're hoping, not to play against cheaters again. i am a serious player who tries to compete and constantly improve, but it is a nightmare trying to defeat all those cheaters in csgo. valve is making enough money out of that game to develop serious measures against them but instead push out more content and game items that can be bought by players, so they can make even more money, maybe they discovered that the cheaters are better customers because they have to buy the game multiple times - on a new account - if they want to play on when they got caught by the community with the built-in overwatch feature.csgo overwatch is a nice feature developed to give the community, especially experienced players, a chance to ban cheaters, but too many players are sick of it and don't even download the overwatch cases anymore. valve has to seriously improve their anti-cheating-measures to get more and happier customers.until this issue with the overwhelming mass of cheater in the game is resolved i can't recommend that gamethere is no real story but it is a real great competitive game with many players around the globe.the spray control combined with movement-affection is well developed and hard to master.timing is key and knowledge of the maps as well as prediction and precision are the ingredients for success ---- especially when there are no (or less) cheaters ---

volka	Recommended	1,428.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/volka/	Basic GameplayYou play as either a Counter-Terrorist or a Terrorist, both of which are deployed into a battlefield and each round are giving a small allowance to purchase weapons of their choice.You can make extra money by winning rounds or you could also hold a knife up to the enemy demanding their money, Although that would be risky since the enemy would likely just to shoot you.On the Terrorist team your goal is to plant and explosive near some uhhm.. important boxes?.Anyway, once plant wait You patiently for it to explode.As a Counter-terrorist you must eliminate all the Terrorist forces OR defuse the bomb, thus Protecting those ever important boxes from certain destruction.Being a honourable opponent, Terrorists are sure to set the bomb timer just long enough to give the Ct's the chance to Slaughter the remaining T's, and defuse the bomb.I'll list some positive/negative attributes of this game here.Positive attributes :- Matchmaking - Teaches children the harsh reality of gambling (although some never seem to learn even after $500 later)- Ranks  - Cool looking skins- Fast growing population of players  - Fat stacks of loot dropped somewhat often- Chickens- High replay value- Deathmatch game type (I could go into more detail on negative parts of it, but that would make this review too long and boring)Negative attributes :Although I Do love the single player campaign, it could use some work. I REALLY wish it were longer.. And that final Boss fight is pretty lame. It only lasts around 27 seconds, and during that time the only way to lose is by taking offense from the old man that constantly insults you, and how his "7 year old could beat you, blindfolded."- The game mode "Infernal" played on the map "de_inferno"Some people like this game mode however I personally dislike it, For those of you that have not yet had the chance to experience it I'll explain for you.It seems like any normal de_ map However, The real goal is to scurry around finding any shred or scrap of rego, Normally it's hidden in obscurer unused sections of the map, and has the ability to shift/move around to different locations, Or even leave the game entirely for up to 10 minutes at a time.- Demolition, Also known as "jokemode" Added purely as a joke that volvo was supposed to only unlock on every April fool's day, However some hacker probably that "4_chan" guy, permanently unlocked it. (Volvo have been working on a fix ever since)Demolition is the game mode which automatically gives everyone amour and then requires you to get kills with weapons that do extremely poor damage against armoured opponents. Also no block is Enabled And Whoa?, So is team killing!The volka StrategyYou could just play this game like a noob and spend hundreds of dollars on skins, OR you could play the game correctly like me. Here is my strategy :-  Don't buy skins to start with, Seriously it's a waste of money.-  Play for a good 50 hrs or so and sell any drop you get.- Wait for a steam sale and Invest in as many copies of csgo you can.- Work your way up to about 5 copies or so But make sure you don't get too many otherwise you won't have enough time to harvest all your csgo account drops (having more than 7 accounts may have diminishing returns) [Note- it takes about 20 hrs gameplay to activate the drops].- Keep playing on all copies frequently to maximise drops.- Once you have your economy built up with this method you can now buy skins with all that free income you have. Remember to Never gamble with opening cases. I've made about $100 with this method. I think it's about time to quit my day job.In a whole, I do love this game And would recommend to anyone, Good half, Good half.

Blank	Not Recommended	1,566.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/karouvirae/	This game will give you low trust factor after 1500 hours of queueing with friends and not cheating - so now you'll have to play against cheaters, griefers, and the lowest of the low as a reward for giving your best. The best thing about it is how they don't even tell you why.If you can deal with things sometimes being very unfair for no reason at all: Go ahead and play it. As a game it's still very good and very entertaining. However, the few issues it has (intransparency about trust as well as cheaters - especially "legit hackers") are too much for me to recommend it openly though

souzones	Recommended	1,060.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/renansouzones/	That's what happens when you take Counter-Strike's competitive playing to the next levelAs a long time Counter-Strike player, I couldn't just let Counter-Strike: Global Offensive just slip by without playing it. As I always followed the evolution of the franchise, I did the same to the game and noticed some improvements as well as things that got worse.Let's start talking about how happy I was when I found out that Valve is now paying great attention to the competitive community of the franchise. Before GO, you only had two options: host a server or play on a rented server you knew. There wasn't a "quick game" option like there is now, turning games much easier to be arranged. And it also works for competitive playing, as there is a whole new competitive mode which players may join to play like they were playing an official match, with official rules applied and no need of typing specific comands on the console as the game does everything for you automatically. Another thing I really appreciated is the guns market stablished for the game, shaking really good the community's market. I bought some games on Steam using only the money earned from selling some of those guns. Another good thing is that Valve also officialized fan game modes like Gungame.However, the game hasn't changed much in relation to Counter-Strike: Source when it comes to gameplay physics or even graphics and sounds. Some people even call GO "CS: Source with skins". And there have been some worsenings related to the guns, like the fact that some useless guns have been added to the game (the new shotgun and PP-19 Bizon are some examples) and others have been "nerfed" (yes, M4A1 and Desert Eagle, I'm looking at you).In the end, Global Offensive won't let you down if you're looking for a very nice first-person shooting game with an immense community to play with. If you like the Counter-Strike franchise, you'll probably fall in love with this game.Still not a 10, but we're getting there.  What I did like What I didn't like   Competitive gaming taken to the next level Game hasn't changed much since Counter-Strike: Source   Newcomers and casual players will also find it easier to arrange matches New (useless) guns   Guns market WHY THE HELL DID YOU DO THAT TO M4A1?!

f a s h w a v e #MRGA	Not Recommended	931.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fashseinistgeil/	TLDR: game with full potential: 7,5/10, game with community on most days: 3/10What is CS:GO? It is a game that uses mechanics that were last common around the year 2000, or rather around then some mechanics were absent in most big shooter titles that are still absent in CS:GO: no aiming down the sights or zooming in for most weapons, no sprinting, no leaning around corners, no weapon bashing, RNG plays somewhat a role while firing (that is how I explain how I have not killed some people at point blank range but I have scored headshots while jumping around spraying in peoples’ general directions…).What is good about it? I like the basic idea: short and sweet rounds that require a plan to win. One team needs to secure an objective (most commonly plant and detonate a bomb) in one of two possible locations while the other team succeeds by preventing the former team from reaching their goal. You need to hide well and rotate around the map in a timely fashion. Map knowledge and tactics theoretically get rewarded. This is a game that rests upon a good idea that gets better when playing with cooperative people.A thing you may or may not enjoy according to your personal taste are this game’s ‘microtransactions’ in the form of weapon skins and operation passes (temporary (!) access to maps and more skins). It is up to you as a player how much, if at all you care about these things. Be aware most of the community seems to be obsessed about these purely cosmetic skins and there are still a few elitists around who hate on people for not owning ‘nice’ skins (just a tip on what to expect from the community, more follows).What is critically bad about it? Valve do not appear to care about the state of the game, not the least about the community, or do not appear capable to solve its rampant issues.In the two years I have owned the game little has changed, except for the fact that assault rifles seem to be harder to stabilise (a so called nerf), a major competitive map that got reworked came out worse than before and at some point Valve thought it was a great idea to add a revolver that behaves like a one handed, one shot kill sniper rifle, except easier to handle (much to the dismay of those who care about balance).Also even in competitive matches I see players with high ping who lag. Match making in general seems to be off. In my own unranked matches I have faced players with almost a thousand hours of experience.More drastically, instead of finding an effective way to keep problematic players out they have added next to the competitive ranks new XP ranks and a system of cooldowns. So during your first dozens of hours of playing, you will often run into the game telling you you cannot play. Not being allowed to play a game which you have payed for is a feature, a bit peculiar how that works. A better solution  this game really needs in my opinion is a more thorough reputation system that separates the wheat from the chaff.I have mentioned the basic idea of this game is very good and it becomes better while playing with cooperative players. However these players are becoming (increasingly) harder to find which lowers the enjoyment found in this game immensely. When I start Insurgency, Arma or Verdun I expect to find well behaved people in each session. Queuing for a match in CS:GO by contrast feels like playing Russian roulette. Playing CS:GO on a regular basis requires you to become callous or unpleasant yourself to deal with other players. A match should routinely start with locating the problematic ones and muting and/or reporting these people. In the vast majority of matches you should expect to encounter at least one of these categories: a cheater using practically universally available and easily applicable ‘hacks’, a ‘smurf’ that intentionally plays on a lower level than his actual skill group (and hereby denying the chance to other people of having a fair match and ranking up themselves), a ‘deranker’ or group of ‘derankers’ who intentionally make their team lose the match (with or without the full agreement of the team) and finally a troll, ‘griefer’ or other general kind of person who behaves clinically mentally underdeveloped. Only once have I seen someone who I reported get a VAC ban. These cheaters and derankers organise themselves in Steam groups of sometimes tens of thousands of people and Valve do not seem interested in banning or removing these. In general, policing the community is nowhere on Valve’s task list according to my experiences. This poses a major problem for players who cannot rank up due to being defeated by cheaters, smurfs and griefing team mates, hence being stuck in the lower ranks or “Silver Hell”.Before I summarise this review, a few anecdotes of what concrete behaviour to expect from the community, all experienced over the course of one week.- On a daily basis: players from the same few language groups of preteen to adolescent age that keep spamming the same expletives in their native languages to you and never share useful information in a mutually comprehensible language. After a while and some googling you recognise the pattern that they are continuously expressing the desire to have various sorts of intercourse with your female family members and so on. Also randomly ‘vote kicked’ by these inclusive groups even if one is the best player of the team.- Me: “Very nice people, speak English please”. Them: “[rude refusal]”. Followed by a whole match of shouting torturing my eardrums. Instead we could have used sharing information and planning to win the match.- Derankers throwing mollies at themselves in spawn reducing the length of each round to five seconds.- Two people claimed to be smurfs, they played with pistols only and when we were miraculously salvaging the match they started committing team kills, tried to get team killed, obstructed team members, initiated random vote kicks, demanded we would abandon our weapons and more such trolling.- From a certain bunch: “Mother Mary is a pig”, “ISIS attack Brussels, haha!”, “Armenian genocide is big lie”, “suck-a my brown [male organ]”.- A Twitch streamer with a VAC ban on a three months old acount upon learning I had two friends with me who were new to the game: “gtfo, they’re [feces], NOOB, NOOB, IZI, NOOB, NOOB...”Number of truly pleasant matches in one week while regularly playing:  one.I became interested in CS:GO by watching youtubers like Anderzel. However now I feel a bit cheated and I realise these people only upload the one in twenty matches or so that runs its course without problems.In conclusion, the game itself in theory is easily worth 7/10 at least which is why some well meaning people such as I want to keep playing. In practice this score gets cut in half or worse. Be aware if you want to play and especially pay for this game, you are agreeing that you purchase an experience where you undergo abuse from the socially unadapted in all kinds of languages from all over the world, revealing the true meaning of the game’s name ‘Global(ly) Offensive’.Some people say it takes over a thousand hours to become truly competent at this game. This game only shines if you play with trustworthy people. If you are not yet committed to this game and you have no four mates to play along, decide for yourself if you want to play something else, go cycling, have dinner dates, play with your children for a thousand hours instead of listening most of that time to overly disrespectful screaming (pre)teens who do not wish to cooperate.

I'm Gold Nova Master now and still Investigator(to become one Win 150 Competitive matches, reach GN1 and be good) in Overwatch. We....1. now have new modes in game like wingman and flying scoutman.2. had Hydra Operation modes like Zip-Zap (knife-zeus only) and Heavy Armor too. wish they keeped Zip-Zap. 3. had Hydra Guardian Campaign which was so fun. i liked it.4. now have new Dust ll map which i like too. many spots for camping now.5. still have improvements and new content in a game released in 2012. OMG.6. still have the useless XP for Overwatch. no increase yet.7. have the new trust system which effectively stops placing griefers/bots in your team (so no need to wait for ppl in lobbies) but increases the risk of facing cheaters and SMURFS in matches alot comparing to prime matchmaking. if they combine it with prime which effectively lowers the amount of cheaters and smurfs u might face, then that can be great. i'm still using prime.8. still have smurfing problem. matches are not balanced.9. still see mad "Russians". voice disabled.I still recommend this game. 9/10 500 hours... Deleted the game cuz of griefers (derank wanting smurfs or simply trollers) that ruined my every match. u might suggest me to play with a team of my friends...its nice in theory, but hey i have over 30 active csgo friends and still when i wanna play i cant find 5 in-game and not in the middle of a match or afk.u might say "ok wait for their match to end". there are problems here:1.i dont wanna wait for atleast 20mins to start my match.2.even if i wait, i cant convince that one person who is already in lobby to wait.3.imagine we wait and he comes after 20mins. the other friend who was already in lobby goes afk now and doesnt hit accept button...4.imagine he comes, my friend is also ready but hey were just 3 and we need 2 other ppl. so we wait for another ppl to come...after some time we find 2 other ppl and guess what? WE JOIN THE MATCH! YES!!! but...theres a cheater in there or the match is extremely unbalanced as a result of smurfs. so..they wont play with me forever! find some other guys again choke! LOOP!  After around 450 hours... Alright im an Investigator now in this Overwatch thing. so far, ive seen many ppl using switch scripts(awp2knife2awp), obvious aimbots(makes u vertigo if u keep watching their demo because of the rotating screen), obvious wallhacks(they dont even wait for their enemy to show up like pro wallhackers and kill them from behind walls after waiting for a second :D), on/off aimbots/aimlocks(they use this technique mostly when theyre loosing hard to comeback(the score is 1-8 for example till when its 5-8 and their team have autos), on/off wallhacks(which are REALLY hard to spot as they use it just to know who is where and for close distances they use footsteps sound) and also griefers that ruin the entire match for their team. so whats my opinion now about my past negative review? well...nothing has changed to me. reason? EXTREMELY unbalanced matches. i first thought they are cheaters that they play well like that, but after specing a few after the matches, i found out that they didnt cheat and i can say confidently now that.....thats all about balance problem matches have. maybe, my teammates in the match were "boosted newbies" most of the time or maybe it's smurfing problem....its clearly not Valve's fault. keeping the community of a game released in 2012 clean is almost impossible. but to me, Valve has done whatever it could. thats exactly why im recommending the game now.  After over 300 hours of playing and while having prime account, i still face lots of bad stuff like: 1.Smurfs: if in other team, they are boosting someone they've got money from OR if in my team, they wanna lose so they can derank to silver l and start smurfing again....so in both sides u will looe the match anyway.2.Cheaters: mostly wallhackers or on/off aimbotters.3.Very! unbalanced matches as a result of high smurfs count.4.Alot of rude kids, toxic players (=players that start abusing/blocking when u fail a 1vs1 or votekick u every round or hit/block u on purpose when they think u play bad). ofc u should have the confidence of Barrack Obama to be able to deal with em.5.Griefers who are usually derank-wanting smurfs. (for definition of griefing search wikipedia)6.If u get kicked many times u will be banned for some time. really?!?!!About reporting....all reports u do, Will Be Effective but after u lose the match and u won't get back points u lost when a cheater is banned. rather than that if u play in a random team containing a cheater even once(which is not your fault) after some time when he gets banned, u will looe your rank and xp ALOT. and he....he makes a new account and plays again happily :DAnyway, im still addicted to this thing and i cant really stop playing it. dont really know why..... When my playtime was around 200 hours... As i got more far from cs1.6 and when went to play other games, a strong passion to multiplayer fps made me come back to this game.anyway...its a great fps game to me, not a pure cs ofc but most similar game to it in the market.rather than explaining the quality of fps thing about this game in detail, i wanna talk about the multiplayer side.its AWESOME! why? its clear. it has a No-Mercy Cooldown (Ban) System that bans ppl who leave a match, kick others so many times, get kicked so many times, attack a teammate twice in beginning of each round, kill 3 teammates in 30 rounds, kill teammate at round start, and man u know whats great about this cooldown system? imagine u get a 30min cooldown. from when that ban ends till 7 days if u get another cooldown for whatever reason it would be 24 hours. and again if u get a cooldown sooner than 7 days after ban ends, that would be 7 days! and so on....also, The Repoting System Works Pretty Fine. after starting to seriously play for a month (my previous play time was 20 hours without any competitive matches played) ive been thanked 4 times for reporting cheaters. game has Investigators who watch a random demo of the players that were reported so many times in longterm or alot less but frequently in short time, and if most of them find the suspect guilty that means a 1 month(griefing) or permanent ban.so, if someone Griefs[en.wikipedia.org], if abuses other ppl using mic or text (or also if someone is a "kid"), just block him when in match and report him and ask others to report him too. dont report him just once...do it many times.well....im an honest person....so to be honest...the problem is that....any cheater/abuser/griefer (including smurf) who gets banned from playing in official servers can rebuy the game again as its cheap. but when they make a new account they have to rank it up to 3 and then they can't win more than 2 competitive matches in a day until they win 10. so their comeback will be delayed.but theres a better way to avoid cheaters/smurfs:  the solution to that problem is simple. play competitive matches from wednesday when weekly xp boost is available and play until u reach "reduced earned xp" each week and u will get to lvl 21 fast. then, get a prime account. it effectively reduces cheaters and smurfs in matches u play.all being said, this game is still ALIVE cuz Valve still supports the game rather than making a new version of it. plus that u wont lose a thing if u spend time boosting your skills in this game as its not gonna die.definitely 10/10.

Pepsiman	Recommended	787.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/killerfrosti/	Counter Strike: Global Offensive is one of those games that is kind of hard not to recommend. It's a solid shooter and it is cheap and looks really good for a game that runs on the Source engine. To new players CSGO may feel a little "back to the basics" as this game does not have aiming down the sight, unlocks, attachments, perks and killstreaks so it's heavily based on player skill and not on selecting the perfect loadout with the perfect perks. This game does have a ranking system but it's different from all the other shooters which I'll explain later on. But the game does show a lot of depth as you play more and you will find out that not everything is as straight forward as it might have looked. It's also a tactical teamplay based shooter, so don't even think about buying it if you don't like teamplay. Only a good team can lead you to victory, not a highly skilled lone wolf.CSGO offers a small variety of game modes, those are: Deathmatch, Arms race, Demolition, Classic casual and Classic competitive. For those of you who are familiar with COD Arms race is called Gun game in COD. You start off with a weapon and every time you kill someone you'll advance to the next weapon until you get a golden knife, kill someone with the golden knife and you win the game. What's rather interesting about Arms race is that you still play in teams 5v5 but the one who killed enemies with all weapons wins. Demolition is a combination between Classic (I’ll explain classic later in the review) and arms race. The goal is to plant the bomb as a terrorist or defend the bombsites as a counter terrorist or defuse the bomb if its planted, there are no respawns and instead of buying a weapon you start with one and advance to the next weapon if you made any kills during the last round and if you made more than one kill you'll get extra rewards like frag grenades and flash bangs. In my opinion those game modes are fun but unnecessary because I never really feel the need to play them.There's also deathmatch which is a little different from the usual (team)deathmatch. It's played 5V5 and all weapons are available except for grenades. you play in a team but it's every man for himself as the person with the most points at the end of a round wins. What's also interesting about Deathmatch is that different weapons give a different amount of points and at some point during deathmatch certain weapons give bonus points. In my opinion deathmatch shouldn't be taken to serious, It's a good gamemode to improve your aim, and I know most new players will jump right into deathmatch but that's in my opinion not the way Counter Strike is supposed to be played.So that leaves Classic casual and Classic competitive which are almost the same gamemodes, therefore I’ll use this section to talk about the things these gamemodes have in common and in the next section the differences between these gamemodes. Classic consists of the two original Counter Strike game modes: defuse mission and hostage mission. In hostage mission the counter terrorists have to kill all the terrorists or rescue one of the hostages (in the other counter strike games all the hostages have to be rescued) and the terrorists have to prevent the counter terrorists from rescuing the hostages by killing all of the counter terrorists. In defuse mission the terrorists have to plan a bomb at one of the two bombsites and make it explode or kill all the counter terrorists and the counter terrorists have to win by killing all the terrorists or by defusing the bomb if it's planted in which case killing all the terrorists does not result in victory. Both defusal mission and hostage mission have a money system. You'll receive money for all sorts of things, playing a round, of course the winning team receives more in most cases, completing a part of the objective like taking a hostage or planting the bomb and kills. The kill reward depends on the weapon, a rifle or pistol will give you 1× kill reward while an SMG (except for P90) gives you 2× kill reward, a shotgun gives 3× kill reward and a knife gives 5× kill reward while the AWP gives only 0,5× kill reward. At the start of a new round you can buy weapons and grenades with the money you earned and the money you don't spend will carry over to the next round.So now the differences between casual and competitive. In casual you play either terrorist or counter terrorist and the best team out of 15 rounds wins, in competitive the teams are swapt after the 15th round and the best team out of 30 rounds wins. In casual you'll receive more money if you lose a round, less if you win a round and the kill reward for a rifle is 150 bucks while a kill with a rifle in competitive rewards 300, the developer did it this way to balance the difference in money between the good and bad team and the good and bad players in casual. Competitive is played 5V5 and casual can be played 10V10. In competitive you have to buy your armor and your defuse kit while you get those for free in casual. In casual you can just drop in a round and leave whenever you desire while in competitive you join at the start of a game and you're not supposed to leave until the game is finished, because if you do you'll get a penalty in the form of a temporary competitive ban ranging between half an hour and 7 days and I've seen screenshots of people getting over 200 days competitive cooldown. This is both fair and unfair as it will punish the players who ragequit, the more they ragequit the longer the cooldown, but sometimes you can lose connection to the server because of server problems or internet problems in which case you'll also receive a cooldown which is highly unfair. If you play casual you'll play with random people while competitive has a ranking system based on your skill and win/lose ratio and you'll play with people of the same skill level as you.There's also a community server browser with servers that have different game rules, use community maps or even have completely different game modes. I don't spend a lot of time on community servers so I can't tell you more than this.In my opinion competitive is the way to play CSGO, I spend by far most of my time playing competitive. Casual is great for practice but keep in mind that people play different on competitive. If you're new though I advice to play a few rounds on casual before playing competitive so you can learn how the gamemode works, how the economy system works and gain some map knowledge, why should you do this in casual? Well competitive is way more serious. There's also an option to play against bots if you're new to shooters but even expert bots are pretty easy to defeat and play really different than human players.The only negative points I can come up with is that the servers have to be improved as hit detection doesn't always works as it is supposed to work, and the ranking system has to be improved. At the time of writing I am silver elite master (fifth rank) but some silver elites (fourth rank) are way better than me and some golden nova 2 players (seventh rank) are much worse. And they could crank up the difficulty of the bots as medium bots in CS:S are way harder than expert bots in CSGO making bot practice less useful.Over the last year this has definitely become my favorite shooter, I even watch CSGO E-sport. It's a crown jewel and it only costs 14 bucks. I give CSGO a 10/10. This doesn't mean the game is perfect, of course it can be improved but it's based on the fun factor, and even though I sometimes HATE this game out of pure frustration, I'll always come back to it and there are barely any games out there that can do that. Everyone who remotely likes shooters should buy it.

unremarkable player	Recommended	1,505.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010863844/	It's hard to argue that this game is probably the best CS release since 1.6. Some will disagree, might argue Source is a better game and they will have their own valid points. In my opinion this game is a true sequel. It brings the fun and nostalgia from the earlier versions of CS, the same flowing game play that made it popular and the heavy emphasis on team game play. It mates the old with the new; the expectations that a FPS be somewhat realistic if not fun to play. It's a modern game; it looks and plays like modern games should but it all looks a bit familiar, like the hot girl from years past that you bump into 10 years later. CS:GO is more technical and team oriented than previous games in the series. Shooting, movement, sound and grenades are completely different and you have to master them once again. Weapons now have a purpose - there's a reason to buy the 5-7 and P250, as well as the MP5 replacement, MP7. Team play is just as important as the economy; once you lose it there's no coming back.It's a demanding skills based that's as satisfying as any CS title has been. Pros: - Updated maps, visuals & sounds - Emphasis on team play - Valve online matchmaking as well as valve casual servers - Extensive customisability & player drops - More realistic player and game behaviour - CS:GO workshop - Pro players - Active development and regular updates - Listens to community - Low-end modern PC requirements for top quality & top resolutionCons: - Gungame isn't the same as CS:S - Because of different skills & tactics, CS:S players will feel like it's a familiar but new game. Skills are transferrable one way, not so much the other; when you play CS:S after CS:GO it will feel and sound like you're playing underwater. - Sound still seems like an afterthought - You will need to upgrade your video card to something made in the last 3 years if you want something that's playable and looks goodRatings:Graphics: 8.5/10, far improved on previous models but there's still room for improvementSound: 8/10, feels like an after-thought, if there's one complaint I have about the game it is that the sound quality and engine just isn't good enoughGameplay: 9.5/10, excellent and extremely playable game with very high replayabilityOverall: 8.5/10, it's a great game and could easily be 9.5 out of 10 with improved audio and slight improvements in visual quality. It's a modern twist on an old classic.Footnote:I lost my way with CS after CS:S and I turned to a variety of other games. Battlefield 1942/2142/2/3, Tom Clancy Rainbow 6, America's Army 2/3/PG. Before then I was an avid player of CS and I would play up to 100 hours per month. When I played CS 10 years ago I always asked, why can't this game be a little more realistic? Why can't they stop people from shooting through 3 walls 20 metres apart and killing with me an awp? Why do grenades act like balloons and float through the air? I can't really emphasise how happy I am that a lot of what shouldn't happen has been removed and the overall quality of visuals, sound and game play has been improved.In the first month of playing I managed to rack up 200 hours of gameplay and I've started contributing back to the community with maps.

VloCro	Not Recommended	1,233.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VloCro/	A Sophisticated CS:GO Review.Alright, it's time for a honest and sophisticated CS:GO review, no hate, just criticism.I've played this game since the beta of around August 2012, and I'm here to tell you that it didn't really get any better.It went all from a competitive team-shooter to a game that's more about the skins than about the actual content featured in the game. For example, we've had a few operations that actually added some new gameplay style, but then again, you need to pay for those. And most of the time the updates revolves around some case with some new community skins in it. (Valve to lazy to design own skins).And then there's the community, now I know there's alot of actual good people out there, but the majority of them are,  you guessed it, Russians/Polskis.Now i don't mind people from Russia or Poland aslong as they play normally, which is most of the time not the case. Most of the Russians / Polski I've met in game are just general derankers and or griefers. Personally I don't really give much about a matchmaking rank other than the bragging rights, but derankers and griefers just take the fun out of my game, and that's just not cool. The most important thing about a game is to have fun, right? Well sadly I cannot say I can recommend to play this game solo if you expect a fun match.And then there's the new matchmaking system everybody keeps talking about. I've experienced it myself, I've lost a couple ranks myself, but from a personal point of view, I don't see much trouble in it. Ofcourse, it's not fun to lose 3 ranks if you win 9 and lose 1 and get deranked. But the real thing is, if you really have the skill I'd recommend playing other things than matchmaking. (like ESEA, FaceIt, LANs) I can understand that people get frustrated if they lose their hard earned ranks, and I agree with them that it's a pretty stupid update, but Valve won't revert the update anytime soon, so it's best to learn to play with it.Overwatch and matchmaking bans are flawed. Overwatch doesn't work because most of the players can't see the difference between a good player, and an actual hacker. Sometimes someone makes sound, and the Suspect just has very good sound so he hears him. Lower ranking players aren't able to hear or see this and convict him of wallhacking. Matchmaking bans are bad because too much team damage and you get kicked. But for example, I throw a firebomb and my Russian team runs into it and stays in it on purpose, then I get banned. Also accidental grenades while rushing are also a part on this.As this review comes to an end, I cannot recommend this game anymore.It used to be alot better back when the gameplay actually matters, but right as of now, VALVE is only interested in filling their wallets. The result is a very broken game with broken mechanics, and not so community-approved updates. (R8 back in release.)Thank you for reading.

This is incredibly awful experience i must say. Russians are the cancer of this game. They are everywhere and ruin the community and the game for others. I wish CSGO would cost like 30-50$ on Steam and that would definitely help to cut the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in it. I wish there was an option to choose who to play with but again that wouldn't help because russians are everywhere. It saddnes me because i fed up with screaming kids and chavos and im quitting CSGO because of it. I can't enjoy the game while i have to listen to angry rednecks on the mic or screaming kids for 40-60 minutes. Despite the outcome of the match i still feel ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because they trashtalk 24\7 and rarely able to play. ♥♥♥♥ this game.PS. I must notice that there is like 5% of cool russians that know how to play and are actually nice but alot(not all ) of them are just ashamed to be russian so the hide their identity from others. These guys are a huge minority and this is truly sad.

Cute Girl X3	Not Recommended	603.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/emiliacuitie/	A solid game. Very good shooter mechanics, Very little support from valve. All valve cares about is "D O T A 2". Only if valve focused on it's anti-cheat. The community is pretty toxic in CSGO.  I still remember getting kicked from the game for being "noob" when i was new at the game. And getting cheaters in opponent. This really leaves a bad taste to the mouth of new players and casual players, since they just wanna have a good game. Many people will say "Go to ESEA or Faceit" But 60% of the playerbase doesn't even know what they do. So it's not really a solution to cheaters. People like me just wanna get back from school/work and have a fun game or two with friends. Hackers just ruin the game. And the worst thing is, People don't even kick them. They "wanna" get boosted by hackers but don't understand that getting boosted will do them nothing good, let alone by a cheater since if the cheater gets banned (they get banned only 50% of the time) they will lose their boosted wins thus deranking. And cheaters, OMG where do I start, VALVE! Please F I X  your  broken game !  there are literally threads on the CSGO reddit spoonfeeding and showing how to fix certain things. V A L V E   still wont fix it. The fact that there is even an hvh community itself puts valve to shame.  T H E  fact that after almost 6 ♥♥♥♥ing years valve still can't fix the chear issue in their 2nd most popular game itself is a shame. What are you doing valve? You guys aren't making a new game !

❤ The Lust of Ass ❤	Recommended	56.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Envy_Me_1_Forever_Till_Death/	Maybe the only FPS where it truly boils down to a game of pure skill. No bullsh*t perks or kill streaks, no auto-turrets, no air strikes. If you want to win in Counter-Strike, you have to learn the maps, play smart, and have fast reflexes. Since you work for each and every kill, it's much more satisfying than other current gen shooters.
SNiPY❤	Not Recommended	4,039.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SilentSniper/	Nice graphics, new maps, weapons and models. But developers should listen to the customers a bit more. Developers you are focused too much on things that are not important at all. You should focus on changing the tick rate of the match making servers to 128 and improving VAC a lot. Those two are what customers really want and you should focus on. Not stickers, UI and HUD changes or skins. And stop messing around with the weapons.
BigT	Not Recommended	3,243.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Visionzzzz/	I would not recommend getting into this at its current state. CSGO has hit rock bottom with Valve's missed promises of game changing updates and their lack of effort to combat the terrible cheating problem. Bugs have been in the game for years and still haven't been fixed. Cheating is out of control. Over the past few years of playing, cheating has gotten worse and worse to the point now where I end up playing against a cheater almost every game. Valve implemented the new "trust" matchmaking system to combat some of these issues but its lackluster algorithm still somehow thinks putting me, with years of gameplay and 3,000+ hours, against people playing on brand new accounts makes sense. I really don't know why I still put the effort to play this game anymore because it usually just ends up with me regretting it. I guess I just wish I could somehow have the fun I used to have playing this game but it seems those days are long gone.

JUB JUB	Recommended	1,211.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015641338/	I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.

Eğer şansınız iyiyse gelen silahların bazılarını kullanıp bazılarını değerlendirerek oyunun tadını çıkarabilirsiniz. Silah Yarışında ise oyundaki tüm silahlarını kullanarak bıçağa doğru ilerliyorsunuz ve verilen her silahla bir kişi öldürmeniz gerekiyor o silahla bir kişi öldürdüğünüzde diğer silaha geçiyorsunuz ve bu bıçağa kadar böyle gidiyor, bıçakta ise en son öldürdüğünüzde modu tamamlamış oluyorsunuz. Eğlenceli. 1.6'dan iyi.

JUB JUB	Recommended	1,211.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015641338/	I thank TrulyRazor for buying this for me a long time ago -- I insisted to him that I would not play it. Seems I was wrong.Most around me have always known me for, perhaps not absolutely hating, but at the very least showing some amount of contempt and disdain for all things Counter-Strike. I should address this before talking about why the game has value. One component of my dislike was cured by playing it, as I knew it would. I simply did not understand the game, most of the mechanics seemed counter-intuitive and frustrating. This changed as I played and came to understand the game -- I expected that.The other element of my dislike for Counter-Strike in general has remained unchanged. The elitism of its players and the toxic, cancerous nature of the community itself. The elitism comes in the form of treating Counter-Strike as if it were above other shooters that do not aim to do what it does. Call of Duty, with its fun, arcade shooting must be seen as garbage, and Halo with its slower-paced shooting with sci-fi shields/weapons/tech must also be bad, for it is different. Battlefield too, not having recoil patterns that take months to completely memorize, is clearly for the trash heap. Inane comments like these come from a simple ignorance about different things serving different purposes, but it is obnoxious nonetheless.The cancerous community is really just that, cancerous. Many talk of Russians in silver matchmaking, I have not encountered this. I have however, encountered toxic, alpha-male types who yell, complain, and belittle others -- who put down their teammates, make them feel like crap, etc. I have encountered all possible types of cringy weeaboos, bronies, and people who recite old memes in deathmatch lobbies and think they're funny. People who make the lamest, overused jokes and think it's hilarious, people who just scream and make noises for shock value. Standard fare for most online shooters but CSGO has a LOT of this.So, yeah, this game has one of the worst communities out there. It's true. It doesn't, however, make the game wholly bad.On to why the game is good.The game does have a very steep learning curve. Slowly coming to understand the way the game works, the importance of each part is satisfying. As you learn positioning, grenade throws, crosshair placement, recoil patterns, and so on you can feel yourself getting better at the game. Not trying very hard and not understanding either immediately ranked me at Silver III when I started. The slow process of getting better and rising through the ranks is immensely satisfying and enjoyable -- I'm now Legendary Eagle (SMFC now). It taught me a lot of patience and willingness to push on even when frustrated. While most of the maps are CT-sided, they are all designed with a great deal of balance in mind. The weapons too, their costs, their recoil, each having drawbacks, give balance to the game.All the elements combined -- the economy, the guns, the maps, positioning, timing, recoil, grenade throws, sound, etc -- and you get a very tense, balanced shooter. There are very few situations where it could not go either way -- if skill levels are equal, I am not claiming silvers have much chance against high-level smurfs. Speaking generally, equally matched players in an average game have an equal chance to win and things can quickly turn around for the whole game  or for any single round if one smart player knows what's going on.I know it's easy to be cynical about bad teammates or people who don't listen, but that's not really got to do with the quality of the game, I'm simply talking about how it should play out ideally.A good game of Counter-Strike in its ideal form is something highly enjoyable -- when teammates are listening, when plays work, when headshots connect, when the other team stands at least some chance, then the game is fantastic to play. It is highly demanding of you, asking disciplined patience, focus, and consistency, but also highly satisfying, granting deserved victory, ranking up, and greater confidence as you become better. There are few other games like it, or that at least, provide a similar experience.I would recommend you play with friends, granted that you have friends you can trust to listen to you, take feedback, and try hard enough to improve with you. Besides the fact that you'll have dependable people to play with, having others to complain about the game with, to share your losses and your gains definitely keeps you sane when the game is at its most frustrating. You learn about the game together, get better together, you point out eachother's flaws and learn from their strengths -- it is, again, much more enjoyable and will also allow you to tolerate the game longer, as you'll be going through the journey with others rather than alone.It is not, honestly, a game for everyone. If you are willing to put effort into this game then you'll be rewarded. If you're a long time player and go into it every day understanding you still have a lot more to learn and discover, then again, you'll be rewarded. (I have found though that, going into ANYTHING with a renewed sense of wonder and willingness to learn grants a better experience.)I recommend this game for any and all who can put in the effort, change their play, practice consistently, learn, and expect progress to come slowly. If instant gratification is your thing, don't play this.Oh yeah, there's also the usual TF2-style item hunt for weapon skins and cases in case you're interested in wasting a lot of money -- not at all implying I am not guilty in this either.So give the game a try, just understand what you're getting into.

Hyena :>	Not Recommended	1,463.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hyena_806/	One of the worst communities in gaming. Griefers, cheaters, squeaky kids, flamers... Theres every type of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that you could possible think of. Every 4th match is a cheater, every 2nd match u get griefers and every single, i mean EVERY single ♥♥♥♥ing match you'll see a flamer in your team constantly trying to kick you or just bully you into leaving by abusing the voice chat. The reasons that you can get kicked in competitive matches are so immature and sad that it's become a serious problem:1.Ofc if you have the lowest score in the first 4 rounds they won't hesitate to vote kick you (even if your score is just 1 or 2 below theirs)2.If you have the least amount of kills. Degenerates don't ♥♥♥♥ing get that, in a 5v5 match, there's always going to be someone on the bottom of the scoreboard.3.My personal favorite, if you dont use one of the following weapons: M4, AK47, AWP chances are pretty high you're going to get voted off regardless of your score.4.Along with these, every ♥♥♥♥-up in terms of losing the round for your team (failed bomb defuse, failed plant, especially if you fail a 1v1, etc etc)Bottom line is that the community is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the only way to enjoy the game is if you have a 4 or 5-man party.Any lower than that you are gonna be paired with one of the mentioned dip♥♥♥♥♥.The rest of the game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ only the competitive part can be interesting and fun so if you dont have friends who play CS GO i would recommend you to stay as far away from this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥community as you possibly can.6/10year olds.

Mav	Not Recommended	143.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198149811191/	Let's give this game an honest review.Okay I wanna start by saying that I am a CS series Fan. I have countless hours in CS 1.6, CSCZ (LuL i know) and CSS. And from all these titles I think CSGO is the worst of them all.I will explain my negative experience with "Garbage GO" by splitting this entire topic into 3 sub categories: Community, Balance, Developer Support.Community:The community pretty much consists of 3 main groups of people:1. Easter European Children,2. Normal People,3. Cheaters.CS never had a problem with toxic and annoying communities however it all changed when CSGO came. I mean Jesus I cant join Casual because there is a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of kids running around and screaming, I can't play on community servers because they are usually 64 people cancer, and competitive just doesn't cut it I mean I like it but I don't want to try hard every time I play this game.Don't get me wrong you can find your occasional good people. But out of 10 matchmaking games 9 times you wish you never met those people.Gun Balance:Okay this one is good.Gun balance doesn't really exist in this game anymore. See back then we used to have the AK, M4, AWP, MP5 and Deagle. Everything else was either situational or a miss click.... See even though these 5 guns where super good and where the only ones used they where perfectly balanced with each other. Meaning that the top tier guns where BALANCED!!!!This is not the case in CSGO. AWP is stiff asf***!, pistols are pure PTSD!, riffles have either not enough damage or weird hit reg, and in general the gun balance considering SMG's, heavy weapons is just ........ JESUS!Take the gun balance of CSGO, but only the gun balance don't look at the brand only the gun balance. If any other game had this type of balance it would be reviewed to DEATH! The gun balance is garbage and everyone who remotely tells me that the gun balance makes sense I just wanna say that what they are saying IS BLASPHEMY!!!!  Developer Support: After the AUG being overpowered as ♥♥♥♥ and the Revolver being a pocket AWP it is clear to see that Valve doesn't test updates like ever.... How can such a big company on one of their most sold games not test updates before they release them it is a mystery to me. Even after millions valve received there is no working anti cheat system, and the only good content that is being released are skins which some of them cost into the thousands when kids in Africa starve. It is disgusting!!!!All the major tournaments, money and skins will never make this game good.If the gun balance and Developer Support is not there this game will awlays remain MEH. I am not a little kid you can feed of with some shinny fade skins. I am very very VERY! sorry what happened with CSGO. I don't recommend this game. Try it out yourself and loose faith in big gaming companies.

I got all the way to LEM and i can say these things about this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥game.1: Smurfs. So many that its not even fun anymore. Once you are higher up in the ranks you will encounter at least 1 smurf per game and they will destroy you.2: Hackers are very abundant all throughout the game. You will most likely run into a hacker at the very least once every 10 or so games. If you legit think that there are not many hackers in this game, you are sorely mistaken.3: The community is worse than CoD's community nowadays. They will make ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arguments about the guns, troll, among other things. It is sad just how low some can go, if you want to see that low, this is the game for it.4: Horrid matchmaking system. I get it, you can only do so much, but from the amount of times I have been paired up with people i should not have, or been put into russians servers, its just stupid.5: Boosting. So many horrible players have been boosted by their friends, or hackers, or both into the high ranks. Then when you play with them they are worse than a bot for your team. 6: 64 Tick servers and horrible hit reg problems. The servers are not good, you will encounter many times when you saw your bullet go through the person you were shooting at simply because what your client saw, and the server saw, are two different things. For a fast paced shooter such as csgo, that is very very bad.All in all csgo was fun, i enjoyed it for a time. That time has long since past. This game could be one of the best of its kind if somebody showed it some proper TLC. Fixed up VAC, upgraded the servers. Helped prevent smurfing to some extent. Now im not somebody with their head in the clouds thinking that everything in this game could be fixed and it would be a perfect game. No, that is not realistic, some of the problems do need fixing though. Maybe one day Valve will care enough to solve them, but i find that to be highly doubtful. If you are looking to become angry, get violent with strangers and friends alike, want to have a stroke and lose your hair through either stress or you pulling it out yourself, this is the game for you.Edit:As of 3/29/2016 there are even more hackers than before. Wallers are in about every 1 in 3 games. Most of them don't even bother hiding it that well due to bans being so avoidable in this game. Ever since polyhacks were released to the public people have been walling like crazy. Don't believe me? thats ok go look on m p g h and see the massive hacking community at work.

SlayZ	Recommended	2,813.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CsSlayZ/	Death is a great teacher. Failure in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is, as it always has been for this series, the greatest way to learn where you should have gone, what you shouldn't have done, and how you could have done better. Counter-Strike players spend a lot of time learning -- consequently, they are always getting better.Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years.For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.Pieces of the Counter-Strike formula are dated at this point, but the superb heart and soul of Global Offensive is timeless. Teams are small, guns are lethal, and rounds are short. There's an addictive just-one-more-round quality to it, because there's a constant desire to do better than last time, to earn a satisfying kill, or to win in a new way. Call of Duty and Battlefield vets will wonder why they can't sprint to escape enemy fire or look down the iron sights to improve aim; Counter-Strike players will feel like they walked into their redecorated home. Certain map redesigns will catch hardcore fans off guard, but the changes are for the best -- the underpass choke point in de_dust, for instance, has a new escape route.Even in the face of genre evolution, Global Offensive doesn’t care to adapt. CSGO is so dedicated to Counter-Strike's aging ideals despite market and trend changes that it brute-forces its way to success. Part of what makes it such an engaging competitive game is that killing in Global Offensive requires a wholly different skill set than other shooters. Everyone is limited to what they have and can see, with little room for character modification or on-the-fly advantages. Running and gunning is a useless play style, even if you've bought a helmet and kevlar that round, to the point that someone standing still is more likely to score the kill. Walking, crouching, or standing are your best bets to reduce the inaccurate spray of machine-gun fire.Consequently, killing in Global Offensive feels good. There's a sickening sensation to dropping someone dead because you know they're not coming back. It's also satisfying knowing you used limited resources to play smarter than your victim. If players aren't watching corners, providing covering fire, or using smoke grenades and flashbangs, they're more likely to take a headshot from a more delicate and patient triggerman. The desire to experience that distinct feeling is a strong motivator to keep playing, even when you're getting steamrolled by an obviously better team.If you've played Counter-Strike before, Global Offensive probably sounds a whole lot like Counter-Strike. Like Counter-Strike: Source before it, Global Offensive exists simply to modernize the look of the classic competitive shooter, while doing little to disrupt the core form and function. At the same time, it does enough to color outside the lines of tradition to justify your time and effort.Fire is one of the most interesting new combat variables. Molotov cocktails and incendiary grenades either roast groups of guys or force them in another direction. Flames are a useful distraction or scare tactic, too. They're particularly useful during Demolition matches, which focus the fight at a single bomb site rather than giving terrorists two to pick between. The new and modified maps in this mode aren't as big as classic Counter-Strike arenas – entire sections have been cut off to direct teams toward a central location – but their thoughtful design is as intricate as ever. The Lake map is a standout -- there's a wide open yet densely populated yard around the bomb site, which is inside a sizable lakeside home with plenty of vantage points and hiding spots. To separate Demolition from Defusal, players can't buy between rounds. Instead, it takes a cue from the other new mode, Arms Race, in which each kill unlocks another weapon instantly. The better you do, the more you have to switch up the way you play, and because Demolition is so fast you'll need to be quick on your feet.

headless_cyborg	Recommended	1,186.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkfighter413/	The following review is based on the Linux versionThe Counter-Strike series is from long term perspective one of the best in FPS genre. Global Offensive improves already proven gameplay mechanics, keeps adding new features and it's one of the best first person shooter games ever made.Perfect optimalization, nice graphics and excellent gameplay. Counter-Strike is one of the few games that ignore today's console-like elements like auto-heal and the player has to think and focus to get the objective done instead of simple "run and gun (and die)". That's why is CS sometimes called "a chess with guns".CSGO is the best multiplayer first-person shooter I've ever played. Yes, the community is often horrible but fortunately it's possible to meet nice people as well.I've played more than 1000 hours (100% on Linux) and I didn't have a single crash or anything like that. So much fun, so many memories, so many nights spent playing with my friends. This game has a special place in my heart. Of course I had a lot of "I will uninstall this **** and never play it again" moments but it's IMO totally fine in a competitive game like CS.System info & performance report  Operating system Arch Linux x64 | Gnome Shell 3.28   CPU/GPU/RAM i5 7300HQ / GTX 1050 Ti [396.24] / 12 GB   Settings 1080p, high, FXAA   FPS ~200-300   Number of crashes in stable version 0   Available APIs OpenGL   Multiplayer yes, cross-platform Linux, Mac and Windows   Linux version rating Perfect   Ported by Valve

Its more of a skillset shooter (Spraypatterns, prefire common spots, when to use each weapon, economy and blah blah blah 1 taps)CS:GO has multiple mods and community servers which shows this isnt a comp. oriented shooter.Multiplayer:Sadly there is the problem. As we all know VAC isnt the smartest anti-cheat system which means you will play against some fishy players (Wh, Aim, 2000$ gaming chair). Only way to really get past this problem is my using ESEA or another 3rd party client (Never used sadly) which needs a monthly fee probably. Other than that the game is pretty fun.Community:The Community is pretty Toxic as it is in almost every Competitive Multiplayer game.There are obviously some mature players but not everyone is.1 good aspect is that you can learn to swear in 81 different languages. (malaka, cy ka bly at, kur wa, ich fick deine mutter, youre g ay, blo ody bas tard, kardashian) some examples.Graphics:Game looks ok for a 2004 source engine. Nothing amazing.Performance:Runs on a German Potato like a charm.Price:Its cheap but i personally would pay a premium price for less cheaters.Recommended if you want to die because of cancer.
hot boy	Recommended	169.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hot_boy_/	 TL;DR  Get this game. The GoodThis is one of my favorite games of all time, definitely my favorite fps ever, csgo is an online 5v5 competitive shooter where you play as both counter-terrorists and terrorists in a 30 round match. There are two major game modes with plenty of unique and memorable maps for you to play and improve on. Csgo does this amazing thing where you play it and you are completely awful at the game. Unlike COD, it has no mercy for those who can not get the fundamentals of the game down, the main 5 being movement, aiming, shooting, map knowledge and team work. This game has such a huge skill gap between the new players and the experienced players to where it can be intimidating for new players to try and play; however, the game has a great balance with their weapons to where new players can use weapons that require relatively lower skill to use and the old players can use the more challenging weapons to master, making it to where everyone can enjoy the game. The game is hyper-focused on how well a individual can do and it is a great thing. Not even mentioning the amazing teamwork possibilities. Put in the time in this game and you will learn a lot about yourself and skills you can apply in real life which is something very few games can do. Background However the game is not a perfect game, yet it comes close. Now before I criticize the game I just want to state that I own this game over 5 accounts with over 2,500 hours clocked online. I have a very good understanding of this game at the highest levels (non pro, rank G/A) on 3rd party platforms such as esea and faceit and I have climbed to the very top of the ranks on Valve's matchmaking. With thousands of games played over years of playing I can confidently say that I have legitimate grounds to review this game on. The Bad - MASSIVE CHEATING PROBLEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Around the rank DMG you will notice an massive increase in cheaters and at that rank and above there is not a single game you will play where there is not a cheater.- A good player with good aim will realize that the shot registration can be odd at times, even watching professional level games on 128 tick servers and 0 ping, the shot registration will simply not work- A good player can NOT carry for victory, one player can lose the game for you, but a good one can't win it for you- There are just several blatant visual draw distance issues on several maps which is kind of annoying and unacceptable for a game in 2018 with this big of a player base- Jumping is very inconsistent, bopping is not viable because of this which is fine because the game isn't focused around this and you can go to the community servers to bhop. Where the problem arises is when you want to throw a smoke that requires a jump, and it is inconsistent without a macro and macros can be considered cheating - In my opinion, some of the guns need major buffs and nerfs, especially the under-used weapons and pistols.- There is a complete lack of tutorial for this game vs. games like quake live, so it makes it harder for new players to enjoy the game which hurts the game if new players lose interest because of the difficulty- Most of the casual game modes are just boring and the big operations are scarce- Skins in the game are blatantly overpriced and the odds of getting anything you want from cases are so slim that it is a waste of money- The updates to the maps feel like they are lowering the skill level for movement which is very disappointing for players who put a lot of practice into their movement- Prime requires you to be level 21- No unranked matchmaking- The cooldown system has a lot of issues that could easily be fixed- The replay system is awfully slow - Overwatch is accessible for low ranked players which is the single most idiotic thing I have ever heard of. It is obviously not a good idea to give the ability to ban players to people who can't get past gold nova, I have gotten overwatch banned before because of this and it is really not fun being banned because some gold nova 3 thought you were cheating.- Low tick rate servers Summary Those are just my main gripes with the game, but honestly even with those flaws the game is still one of my favorites, an easy 10/10 for me as this game has taught me a lot of skills I can apply in other fps games, but more importantly I learned a lot about teamwork, my mentality to playing competitively and learning from other players who are just better and dealing with the reality of my own ego while reaching the highest ranks the game has to offer. It is truly an experience I will never get from any other game; this is the game that has ruined all other games for me for a very long time until recently I was able to put it down. It is a game I can always come back to and enjoy every time and I already know within the next year I might inspire myself to push even further than what I thought was possible skill wise, but until then I will enjoy the game casually.Thank you to the people who actually take their time to read this.

'WitteBae 🌹	Recommended	17,710.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WitteCS/	Counter-Strike makes you work to enjoy the content, and you'll have to put many hours of play into it before enjoying the feeling of conquering it.Weapons are a huge part of the series too, with CS:GO not an exception. Each round provides a cash sum based on your previous performance, and with this you can purchase armour, projectiles and weapons. Firearms range from standard assault rifles to shotguns and sniper rifles, and you'll want to experiment with each one to see which works best.What makes Counter-Strike such a popular series - and what will no doubt make CS:GO the next big PC shooter - is the thrill of the ego chase. As you die, often continuously, the frustration is outweighed by an aspiration to do better. In a game where success is pinned on attention to detail, death often triggers an internal failure analysis that the player will mull over while waiting for a new session to load. It becomes a spiral of egging yourself on to do better - and if you become a good player, the game becomes a stage for you to parade your skills.Global Offensive builds on the CS series by going through a significant checklist presented by its community and marking off as many points as possible. Gun game as its own separate mode? Check. Competitive capabilities built in? Check! Map balancing here and there? Check, check, check.As a result, there are numerous upgrades that will adjust gameplay while also making accessibility far better. The wide range of grenades, for example, will likely make play more tactical - laying down incendiary grenades will thwart rushes, while decoys, which fake gunfire and fool radar points, are brilliant tools for messing with the minds of established players.The actual core shooting will be a huge talking point for many months to come. It has been tinkered slightly and gives weapons a noticeably floaty feel, which doesn't sit well to begin with. We eventually found ourselves enamoured by it, and the impact of hits add a real tactile distinction to play.It's what doesn't work, however, that is most notable. Regular mode has no new maps added to it, while all the new guns seem somewhat cosmetic. Global Offensive has also removed some of its middling weapons such as the MP5, essentially pushing even more players to stick with the AK and the M4. Sometimes it gives the impression that there is in fact less valuable content than in previous CS releases.If one assumed this was Counter-Strike Source with a visual mod installed, there would often be little to shake that impression.There's also now a split between casual and competitive servers - however, many players aren't yet aware of the differences, mainly because the distinction isn't made obvious enough. It becomes even more confusing if you join a community server with all hosts of mods installed on it, which have perhaps taken casual mode, turned friendly fire on and essentially made it as close to Source as possible.At times, arranging games in Competitive Mode feels like a chore. Joining a five-on-five war is simple enough, but attempt to lobby up with a group of friends and join a game, and you'll often hit a snag. Myself and a few others tried to find a competitive game with no luck, simply being told that no servers were currently available.When you finally do join, it works fine, but the wait and work required to find a game seems like a drawback. We eventually gave up and resorted to using IRC to find matches, as we would with Source.Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is not the key evolution point that we were hoping for, and the response from the community often reflects this view. On many occasions, other players used phrases such as "same old" to us.This is elementally Counter-Strike Source with some fine-tuning under the bonnet, and Valve appears to have acknowledged this with the reasonable RRP attached to it.And yet the core DNA of the game has not lost its appeal. This is still a glorious experience that sets a benchmark for all multiplayer shooters. Valve's objective with Global Offensive was to draw together the active communities of both the Source and trusty 1.6 edition. It clearly has a good chance.

It annoys me that when I finally have the patiences to sit down and write a review about this game, that it had to be a negative one. I liked this game, loved it at some point, but it has evolved into a monsterious sh*t hole of a game. The updates are just getting rediculous. I have had, give or take, 1600 hours of competitive gameplay done and the ranking system is completely unreliable. I agree with most of the comments that say "When you reach a certain rank, all you get are hackers.". I've read so many comments on how the community would like for VAC to be better and yet game developers are ignoring this call. Instead, they're making updates of which benefits them "financially". Like who in the world said that gloves would be a f*cking great asset to the game and that we needed more things to waste our money on. The game itself is cheap, yes, but the fact that the past updates has been about gaining money is beyond my comprehension. Side rant, I really loved playing Dust II (Yes, I am basic). I've played so many games on the map that I've managed to learn every smoke/flash spot and am capable of reading enemies like an open book. Long story short, Dust II was "Mah house". However since developers has decided that updating the map would be a great idea, I've lost every knowledge on the "New and Improved" Dust II. It took forever for most of us to get good at a map, and yes I know I can just "re-learn" the map but why would I want to waste more time on practicing when the map might be updated again? Dust II was Iconic, many older players can vouch for that so why change an already perfect map? I guess new players could benefit from this but how about the old ones? Please fix the game, thank you.*Also I do still go on at times to trade skins or play community servers cuz the game itself isn't bad, just the community and some updates.

(And the enemy team will contain a smurf, an aimbotter, a global elite, a wallhacker, and the guy who only uses AUG, P90, autosniper or AWP, and will always insult you.)You can aim any rank, but you will never get it, you will stuck in silver forever, frankly you will not receive anything from this game, it will just suck away your time, your money and your neurons...It's a shame Valve doesn't give a fook about kids who became gambling addicts because of the skin sitesEDIT: After 1 year I re-downloaded the game because I wanted to try out the new MP5SD. After some R6S gameplay the shot pattern is just.......ridiculous and unreal, Siege has lucky shots too, but this game has like 3-4 times more. And no, my aim not sucks, I can use all weapons in the game (I've mastered AK one-tapping and AWP flickshot). Guys there is a thousand times better FPS shooters on the market (Insurgency, R6S, Verdun, Squad, Arma, Overwatch etc.), just dont buy this game, you will get mad of it.

Skystar	Not Recommended	2,119.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skystar1997/	(Update 24th of december)It's just not what it's used to be anymore..Community:COD was most likely known for the game with the most toxic community full of kids, but since cod got worse a lot of kids came to csgo and here is the problem. The CS community became more toxic now and it's quite Annyoing for people to have a squeaker in their team. Their voice isn't even the problem.. It's just that they feel like KennyS and claim the AWP as their personal weapon for the whole game and if you tell them to stop playing AWP, you just get a ''♥♥♥♥ you'' or ''shut up idiot'' in response. Now let's be honest, how many times did your mum get ♥♥♥♥ed by 8 years old squeaker? According to the game probably over 10 times am I right? Don't get me wrong, it sure as hell is funny to make those kids mad, but at some point, they become a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Competetive:I used to play competetive with a full team, but sometimes you just don't get 5 friends to join and you just start looking for a game with 1 or  2 randoms. When you and your 2 friends found a game, you realize it was a mistake to play with 2 randoms, because either they are russians who were boosted and only speak in their language or you get 2 salty kids. Pretty much both russians or kids is bad, because once you lost 3 or 4 rounds, they start teamkilling and as a result they mostly receive a 7 days cooldown. Then you have a bot in your team and the game is probably lost. You are starting to feel upset and you are frustrated, because this match was a failure.Elo system:Don't have to say a lot about this right? A lot of people complain about the elo system in csgo and so do I. You're on a 8 games winstreak and then you lose 1 game and get downranked. Having a good rank is everyones goal in CS:GO, but ranks don't really say anything about skill anymore, because of all the smurfs. Yet you're eager to have a rank like LEM or supreme or even better... Global! Skins:A unnecessary feature which makes the game look nicer, but some skins just cost as much as a car in real life... I know, you don't have to get skins, but so many people buy those expensive skins and try to make other people jealous.. I think, it's kinda sad if someone wasted tons of money just for a digital item. Now skins are not just expensive, the other bad thing about this is the amount of scammers in this game. Now if you look past all of those negative things I named in this review. Go ahead and buy this game. I won't stop you. This game can be a lot of fun with friends. Yet if you try to play it serious, this game becomes a really frustrating experience. CS:GO is broken, because of it's community and the latest updates weren't a big help either. Weapons like the M4A1-S that I used to play a lot are literally unplayable for me now oh and the messed up HUD in casual is still not fixed aswell as the spawning in teammates glitch. Hey but whatever instead of fixing those things Valve decided to add a new gun to this game. 10th december the R8 Revolver was added to this game and you were able to kill 5 people with one bullet. It caused a lot of hate, because this gun was like a freakin' AWP. They reduced the damage now though, but was it really necessary to add a revolver?Oh also. Save your ''just because you're silver'' comments okay? Thank you.
lost	Recommended	2,917.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/54k/	So I've been playing this game for long enough that it deserves an honest review. After playing a lot of TF2, I bought CS:GO and it was a relatively smooth transition for me due to my TF2 experience. CS:GO easily became my favorite game to play. I originally got ranked at silver 4, and started my climb from there. Over the course of roughly a year, I've made plenty of friends, and learned a lot about the game. I'll separate this into two groups below:The actual game:CS:GO is a game that, for me, bridges the gap between a competitive game and a game I can play all day just to have fun. With CS:GO's matchmaking, it is quite easy to get into a 5v5 competitive game with people of equal skill as you. Matchmaking is a great way to start playing competitive CS:GO, but it is not ideal if you want to improve. If you want to take CS:GO more seriously, you have to use 3rd party services such as FaceIT, CEVO, or ESEA where you will face players that have a higher skill level than in matchmaking(not really FaceIT, FaceIT is the "entry-level" service, at least in North America, so it has a lot of newer players). Unfortunately, Valve's matchmaking system is flawed and has smurfs in low ranks and hackers in high ranks, so most people that want to improve or play seriously tend to use 3rd party services.Also, CS:GO has community servers just like any other source game. These community servers run different mods and feature special community-made gamemodes such as KZ, bhop, minigames, retakes, awp only, scoutzknives, and many others. These various gamemeodes supply me with hours of casual fun with my friends when I just feel like relaxing.Trading/skins:Trading has effected CS:GO both positively and negatively. With the addition of weapon skins into the game, CS:GO grew rapidly. CS:GO trading brought a lot of TF2 traders over to CS:GO and started an ingame economy similar to TF2. Also, skin betting on csgolounge was added. Betting skins on professional matches lets you put skins on your favorite teams to cheer them on to victory. The thing is that many people take betting way too seriously(death threats to players, ddosing matches, etc etc). Csgolounge betting has had way more negative impacts on the game than positive in my opinion. I personally try to stay away from trading because it is honestly too stressful for me, and I have no patience.That's all I have to say about CS:GO right now. I would recommend CS:GO to everybody that plays any type of shooter game. A mere $15 has given me nearly 2000 hours of enjoyment, and it will continue to supply more fun for me for a long time.

GlassyTea	Not Recommended	1,859.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GlassyTea/	Hi my name is Graydon, and I would like to say I havent wasted over 1500 hours of my life on this game.So many things in this game are broken, and id reccomend to stay away from it alltogether to be honest.The ranking system of the game is the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ thing I have ever seen. The ranking system is based about 99% on game wins. I play with people in this game to have fun. They may not be the greatest, but why should I be punished, and go DOWN in ranking if I get the most kills in the entire game, but overall my team is not able to pull through. The game is filled with hackers, and "smurfs"(people playing in a ranking lower than their own). Even with "prime" people are still able to get around this. Before I played with friends I was at an average ranking of Master Guardian, now I am usually around low silver-low gold nova. Overall I think the ranking system is horrible.Next I would like to say the Cooldown system is absolutely horrible. I have gotten myself up to a week ban from killing friends which is fine for me. But I have been getting better- not killing any friends anymore. Now I am getting banned from kicking 1 person that was AFK, and said he was throwing. This was in my first game getting off of a week ban. Because of kicking 1 AFK teammate I am now banned for another week.The gameplay mechanics are alright, but occasionally luck can be your best friend.The community is extremely toxic, and I absolutely hate playing with random people. Hence why I play with friends.I would reccomend you stay away from this game, and avoid wasting your time and money.Thank You

Komomo	Recommended	552.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kozlon/	The spiritual successor to "The Secret of Monkey Island™" (titled cs:go) is one of my personal favourite point and click adventures of all time; wether it's the engaging puzzles or intricate story, this game is always sure to provide hours upon hours of family friendly fun. the game's premise is that you're either a "CT" or a "Counter-Troublemaker" who's job is to stop the "T's" or "Troublemaker's" shenanigans, such as graffiti, egging houses, or the such. All these are of course now animated, comparative to the simplicity of  "The Secret of Monkey Island™". All in all, a great game and tons of fun. But it's kind of a rough port, and i'd reccomend purchase on ps3. 8/10

ZA WORLDO	Not Recommended	91.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/poodaddy/	I will never recommend or possibly play this game again. Too much drama has been poured into this game, that it is sickening. We have devolved to a state of madness which has eternally damned us in the name of CS:GO. First it was the ridiculous overwatch system, which in itself was not a bad idea. However, when looked at on paper, the abuse potential is amazingly high. Then it was Competative mode, the worst thing to ever happen to counterstrike. Then there was the skin gambling scandal. I would rather have cheaters and griefers in CS:GO than have riciculous overwatch bans and griefer bans.  The update on 10/25/2016 they took tooo far. CS:GO had always been a grey topic for me, but now I publically denounced CS:GO and anyone who is a dev, mod, or manager of it. You sold your souls to this? Are you happy players? Is this what you wanted? 'This game' is a disgrace to what counterstrike is supposed to be about. CS:GO devs, you have committed what is unforgivable. Let's just hope this embarrasment of a game is forgotten in 2022. I have never been VAC, Overwatched, or game-banned. I am a normal player who is easily bored, but when tyrants take over games; I cannot remain silent. CS:GO has gone from bad to worse.

Microsoft Excel	Not Recommended	1,188.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/devonshiremasterrace/	I really want to recommend this game. It's a more immersive shooter than any of the Call of Duty series, and the way the game is made requires logical thinking and tactical strategies to win rounds with your teammates. When the game goes well, it's buckets of fun.Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this game to newcomers. There are many reasons for this. First of all, unless you plan to mill around in deathmatch or the other lesser-played game modes (so anything but casual/competitive), you're going to die, a lot. And then you wait. You watch your uncooperative anonymous Russian teammates slowly break apart and lose the rounds in the most ludicrious fashion. If you can stand the game long enough to become half decent at it, you may find that you can often shoot someone in the head, literally tracing the bullet into their cranium, only to see that it doesn't register the hit due to the sub-standard 64 tickrate matchmaking servers and/or your West Country internet connection, thus falling victim to yet another unfair situation. If your internet connection is not the problem, you may try using ESEA or Faceit to play your competitive matches with. So you can pay more to play the game for no benefit other than to escape the crap quality of the standard servers, or faff about on Faceit, waiting for the afk team captains to pick maps, or the other team to cower away during the initial deciding knife round. After a few bad experiences, I've decided that Faceit isn't worth the hassle. Playing competitive also puts you in danger of not only numerous wallhackers, but mainly these things called smurfs. Put the image of the little happy blue creature out of your head: these are the players with a high rank on their first steam account, then make second/third/fourth accounts to play against easier opponents. It's that simple, yet it's infuriating and game-destroying for us lower ranked players. And when you discover this in a competitive game, your only choices are to stay there and endure it, gradually losing your sanity, or take a competitive ban. If you're lucky enough to have decent friends, they may just kick you from the game, sparing you of either choice.Having played almost 3 solid week's worth of the game in total, I have accumulated a wide friend group who also shares my pain, but we still play together for the social side. This is when I can recommend the game: when you've already played a lot of CS:GO and have many friends that also play the game. If you're new, and have less patience than a special forces marksman, you're going to hate this game. I hope that if you decide to play this game, you can take my advice with a pinch of salt, as I am admittedly easily riled up in the heat of the moment. However, if you too go ape, you only have yourself to blame.Also, look out for skin collecting. I've been caught by it, it saps a lot of your money, and is literally an addiction. Not a good one like being immersed in a fandom or crack cocaine: one that's ultimately utterly pointless.

It can happen from time to time that you get some hackers in Matches.-Smurfs/DeRanker and Griefer will destroy the experience often-Updates that debalance the game -Valve is jut intereseted in selling skins and CasesAs a conclusion if you are a hardcore competitive gamer who doesnt fear a steep learning curve or toxic teammates,and you can ignore the hacker/smurfer/griefer every second game. Then try it out. For everybody else it isnt worth trying. Dont waste your time and money with this game. And try something else! :)Thank you for reading. Have a nice day everybody!
JokemL	Recommended	455.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JokemLxd/	Hi im JokemL, and im a CS:GO player. I have played over 1500 hours over multiple accounts. And I have now decided to write a little review.I can't remember that much from when I first got the game, but it went something like this:Play one game-quit-next day-play one game-quit, and that went on for a little while.Now that I am a little older and know the game better then I did for just 4-5 years ago, I can tell you what I like and dislike about this game.Starting with what I like about this game:I like that there is a solid community around the game, though there is alot of scammers/hackers/others, but there is always someone kind just around the corner.When I started playing CS I liked the pistols on CT cause I felt like I was in the police force. I also liked the AWP and the Ak-47 cause of the insane damage I got with it. I didn't really use the other guns, but other people played good with it.The game felt really good at the start and I was ready to be a pro. Getting a rank wasn't so big for me at that time, only playing Deathmatch or Gun Game most of the time. I can't even remember my first ever rank.My tips to new players: Don't care about what rank you get. Start with having fun and playing on your own level.After watching alot of videos of how to get better and how to improve this and that, I started playing more serious. Changing my settings to what the pros have, Using other crosshairs and viewmodels and such. I started playing better and doing better on the scoreboard.I started warming up everyday to keep me on the level I was. Playing with friends that have good game sence and a microphones and having good communication was the key to a better experience and a happy rankup.Youtubers that posts tips and tricks: https://www.youtube.com/user/OfficialBananaGamershttps://www.youtube.com/user/TrilluXehttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRr_0ZyHkDPpWky3uXlVZIAAnd there is alot more people that posts tips and tricks.What I dislike about the game: Starting with Hackers. There is always going to be some kind of cheaters in CS and that it's hard for valve to ban them all, but I think they could do better.The amount of hackers I meet on a daily bases is just insane, example wingman. In wingman there is atleast one hacker in 1-3 matches, and I have reported so many of them and up to 20% of they have been banned but up to 80% of they still allowed to play on valve secured servers. This is a problem.Toxic. You may have heard the word toxic before, you may even be toxic. There is alot of players that are toxic, saying bad words to you, been hateful against you, telling you that you are bad and things like that.This is a problem that will never be solved, just because of how many plays the game and how many people that gets mad if someone is bad or you losing a game. Toxic players is hard to deal with and you have to either mute him or just try to talk to him in a normal way.Scammers. Scammers is also a thing that ruins the game for most people.To lose alot of money because of a scammer is not the most fun thing on this planet.it has happened to me aswell, loseing over $200 cause of a scam is not fun at all.Thats why you always should double check every trade you do. (Don't trust people over the internet)I love operations, but it takes so long before the next operation, so we just sit and wait for over 1 year...This is something that makes me a little angry. CS is the same over and over again and that is not a bad thing, but we would love to sit back and relax with a operation.Overall I like this game and I think you would like it aswell.Thanks. Signed JokemL

Farre	Recommended	221.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960337918/	The basic concept of competive Counter-Strike match has changed very little in the past 17 years:  5 terrorists and 5 counter-terrorists fight each other in order to detonate/defuse bomb or eliminate  entire enemy team to win. Same old story but everything is polished to a perfection. You usually find a competive match within a minute and game is ready to start usually within 5 minutes. When playing other game modes a game is usually ready for you almost instantly.CS:GO servers are really stable and I have never experienced a server or game crash. If one players happens to quit/drop/crash player is automatically replaced by a computer controlled bot. This is a great improvement as one or even two players quiting no longer means 100% sure lost.There are multiple gaming modes available and while most people play just competive I strongly suggest atleast trying Arms race and demoliton modes. They offer far more easy going, less stressful and quicker game sessions.Counter-strike has always been all about teamplay. Playing competive is almost pointless without a microphone which is the best way to discuss with other teammates. Typing with keyboard is not good enough because gameplay is so fast-paced. You get most out of this game when you are playing with friends. Most of the CS:GO community seems to be younglings and that means there will be a lot of swearing, bullying, insulting and bad sense of humor. Pretty much in every single game with strangers.I have played Counter-Strike since 1999 and playing CS has never been as easy & smooth as it is today with CS:GO. Easy to learn for people new to fps games and hard to master even for fps veterans.[HISTORY LESSON] Just to point out how easy competive match making is made in CS:go, I tell you how you found a competive match in early 2000's: First you had to gather 5 friends to play (sometimes you had to wait like an hour before you could find all the players, because everyone had to be part of the same clan/team,  you couldn't play with strangers). After that you had to go to a specific IRC chat channel to find your opponents (5 mins if you had a server of your own, up to an hour if you didn't). Then you confirmed the match with your opponents at Clanbase (A site that keep track with clans/teams wins and losses). Finally everything was set for all players to manually connect the game server. Use console command to start recording your gameplay (in order to proof after the game that you are were not cheating) and start playing. After the match upload your gameplay records to clanbase and pray that your opponents are kind enough to confirm the correct game score as soon as possbile in order to receive points from winning.

ezwip	Not Recommended	786.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ezwip/	This was once the best game on Steam, until they dropped the ball. They created a juggernaut through skin drops which led to gambling and conjured the dark seedy side of the net. When it grew too big for its britches they cut off the gambling leaving everything in disarray. The games neglect was all too evident. All that remained was the crippled gameplay itself and websites that sold lifetime cheats and a terrible ranking system. Many will swear by this game but the truth is that the game is tied to a lifestyle of cheating and you are competing to become the best cheater. You are not to speak of this side of the game it is a not so secret club with a single rule, don't talk about it. That is the awful truth of CSGO where even pros are caught using hacks and major competitions are won by showcasing your unknown glitch. If this sounds great to you then this game will be a favorite for a long long time. After all Delta Force released in 1998 and people are still cheating in it right now. That's just a cold hard truth that the community wants to hide from their non cheating prey.For the rest of us we have departed in search of greener pastures and memories of what was, for a time, an amazing game. As the market for skins continues to drop due to a lack of betting skins on matches, the last of the fair players will lose hope as reality sets in. This game will not extinguish quickly as the the majority of players purchased lifetime cheats and have multiple accounts. This becomes apparent as you get better and more people turn cheats on against you. This is called toggling as they turn their cheats on and off just often enough to win crucial rounds. You will hear people talking about toggling all of the time and people complaining that they are too obvious and offering tips to better conceal their deeds. After all cheaters are just a big happy family around here. There is no strategy worth the effort to counter people seeing through walls. Who do you think is going to rank up you playing legit or a wallbanger? With that in mind who do you think is ranking up if hardly anyone is caught? It is obvious right? If Steam ressurects gambling you may witness a resurgence but it is the loss of truly skilled and talented players that are the real story. Pro players voiced their frustrations over bugs and glitches only to be ignored. Valve released spray paint cans as some type of absurd diversion to the state of the game itself. This games community is a toxic pile of lies. If you choose to doubt me and embark on your own journey I invite you to read the novel John Henry. That will be you my friend, with your trusty slam hammer, competing against a machine until you die from exhaustion. Such is the state of the game and until sites aren't selling lifetime cheat memberships with timers showing they have been undiscovered for years... wtf ever I'm done with this game. If you like scammers buy this and watch as you are bombarded with phishing scams. You can convince others that I am wrong but after 750 hours on this game I am not listening to it another second.The real ranking system:Cheaters on topScammers in the middleLegit players at the bottomAt no point will competition change as you will play the exact same people on different accounts no matter what ranking you are. It's just a big joke.

Sometimes you'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ players who're just trying to ruin your game. Or sometimes you will get smurfs who're just "trying to chill". Valve don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the community. What does Valve do? Of course! They're making sales and selling more copies of this game to smurfs and cheaters. The worst players I've met on MM were: Polish, Russian, French, Turkish and German(No offence to any nationalities, I'm just sayin'). Useless updates. The updates are completely useless. Developers of this game do give a single f*ck about its community. They just want to make money. They do not want to fix the hitboxes, they do not want to fix their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ servers, they do not want to fix bugs. They just want to make money. The game NEEDS fixing. What do they do? They are adding more stupid cases and skins. They are changing the f*cking sounds for no damn reason. Yes, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive could be a great game, but not until the developers understand their mistakes and start giving a f*ck about its players.
gameo7	Not Recommended	310.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gameo7/	I WANT to like this game, i really do. There are just so many things wrong with it that i can't. And i'm not talking about the gameplay itself, I'm talking about the people. The amount of hackers, greifers, major a**holes and toxic people is rediculous. Hacking is pointless and stupid and makes the game not fun for others. Just play the actual game. Besides hackers, there are people in competitive games who make you want to rage quit or shoot them by blocking your way to not let you out of spawn on PURPOSE, therefore getting a 30 minute-7 day ban. And then there are the ones who kick people for being a different race or being a weeb for no other reason. It's horrible. I can't belive there are people who would do such a thing like that. I can't believe this is what we've become. There are other things that i have problems with, like competitve skill groups, and the fact that i have met people who i became friends with, but were actually just pretending the entire time, or all of a suddon hate me for who i am. But i think i've said enough. I would give this game 0/10, but because of all the good times i had with people, all the experiences i had in the 300 hours i played this game, i'm giving it 5/10. Would still not recommend playing, but it's your decision.Edit: yes, it is extremely addicting, for me anyway.

Halo had no russian, and this game is full of it. Since the game is so easy that is more hard to play in silver levels than in eagle levels, the Russians make the game quite challenging. Like when you got one in your team, you know that the game will be a thug battle.(Just kidding Love y'all! <3)Thanks Valve for the best Hal.. ehm CS you have ever made.

I quickly shut off my computer and went outside for once. I thought about what i was thinking...I decided to go back inside, still trying to get it out of my head..."a csgo addict". I started crying...I didn't know what to do. I couldn't stop playing now...I have only just begun. I looked at all the money i had left and wasted it on cs go skins. The addiction is growing. I couldn't stop it even if a tried, thats when i realized...that i have fully became a cs go addict.To this day, I'm still a cs go addict.

People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases. They never make a new map only remake ones to make it better which will take more than 10 months to ♥♥♥♥ing make and then once the new map is released it will still be unplayable. Im giving this game a negitive review as i believe its the most over rated game ever developed and comparing it to other fps's is stupid as they different.

beo	Recommended	672.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997324987/	That type of game which could relate to sweet old times of 90s when games were both challenging and simple enough to offer thousands of hours of gametime and still not being completely satiated. CSGO puts the CS title back on top of the competetive games and is a rightful king with undefeated throne for a long, long time.The skillcap of this game ranges from a total casual player to a hardcore pro and cannot be described be words how many factors differentiate a pro from a noob.This is the true and only FPS online game to play in 2014 onwards.

Also, CS: GO will introduce new gameplay modes, matchmaking, leaderboards, and more."Counter-Strike took the gaming industry by surprise when the unlikely MOD became the most played online PC action game in the world almost immediately after its release in August 1999," said Doug Lombardi at Valve. "For the past 12 years, it has continued to be one of the most-played games in the world, headline competitive gaming tournaments and selling over 25 million units worldwide across the franchise. CS: GO promises to expand on CS' award-winning gameplay and deliver it to gamers on the PC as well as the next-gen consoles and the Mac."I played Counter-Strike game for almost 5000hours, and I can say the source was the best CS game, GO is about skins, but not gameplay, new UI, but not new hitboxes or something like that, it was fun to gamble, but now? I don't feel this game anymore.

AyDrin	Not Recommended	2,654.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aydrin/	4/10Great game, with amazing potential. But lack of developer trancparency and rampant cheating will lead to it's downfall.Lets start this off by saying V.A.C. is a joke... it doesn't do much other than be a meme for the community to bash on. Valve makes billions of micro transaction and yet does nothing to improve player experience by cracking down on cheater and hackers. Every low skill competetive game is full of smurfs (players with alot of experience playing in lower level games) and or hackers. Valves overwatch program catches non cheating players who happen to have a streak of good games/plays, and fails to capture the "closet hackers" - or people who using hacks, but play a style that makes it seem that don't. "Prime Matchmaking" failed to deliver on it's goal of seperating out cheatings/smurfs from players who wan't to play against players their skill level and have a good time. It was a good idea, worked at first, but if a player can get a program undetectable by VAC, how hard is it for them to buy Prime Ready Accounts, and get access to a phone number?Rumors have been spreading on community forums that Valve is in the works of a "Super VAC" yet it's been 5 or so years since the games launch, and they yet to deliver on anything more than in game accessories (gun skins, stickers, music kits, GLOVES, pins, etc) and questionable mechanic changes. I understand they want to make money - but who is going to buy their products when no one is around because of the shakey servers and toxic/hacking community.I'm extremely disappointed in Valve - like many others, this review will get drowned in the vastness of QQ and phony reviews. There is only one way to getting Valve to act...Boycott all Valve microtransactions. I'm am no longer buying any more products through Counter Strike or any other valve game until they make reforms to match making. When they have they revenue stream in jeopardy - only then will they listen to player/community concerns and start making changes we want/need to see.For current players, I feel your struggle, hear your cries, and share your rage. Stop purchacing valve skins, keys, kits, pins, whatever. Stop using the community market and boycott all valve micro transactions.For future players - hold off from playing this game, the current experience will only turn you away and make your want to quit before you have seen the small glimor of light that is the csgo community. As well, don't purchase the game unless you are ready to pay 5$ a month for a 3rd party subscrition in order to have a decent competetive experience.TL:DR - Game has potential, but too many hackers. Valve doesnt do ENOUGH to remedy the issues.Use your wallet as your voice, stop buying Valve related products (including your favorite skins) until our concerns and issues are addressed and fixed.

Then after that get frusterated because of things she does that doesn't make sense but still be with her. Then we'd have sex again. When we're in bed I'd be killin' it ontop, but when she's ontop I just absolutely hate it as she dominates me. After that we'd get into a fight about who was better that round and we'd always end the fight at a negative note. The next day I'd start talking to her again and the cycle goes on and on. CS:GO is the equivalent to an abusive relationship. 10/10 would recommend just because being ontop feels pretty good in this game.

eys	Recommended	1,330.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/eys912/	I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.

TesseracT	Recommended	2,485.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/csgoco/	Counter Strike Global Offensive in itself is a good game. We are getting frequent updates from the dev’s and the player count keeps increase. Rather than writing a lengthy summary of my opinions of the game I have decided to break it down into two groups of bullet points. **The Good*** High skill ceiling but easy to start FPS * Lots of fun to play with friends / make new friends * Many of the guns are viable unlike previous versions* Dev’s connect with the community and gradually make tweaks and ingame changes after deliberation. **Needs Improvment*** Visibility (HDR / Bloom are locked down unlike prior versions). * Upgraded anti cheat (too many hackers in higher elo MM). * Movement and accuracy modifications.* Some guns need further tweaking (Deagle / P90) * Valve servers need lower VAR / higher tickrate * **Overall Rating **8.5 / 10
The Elusive Nippleless Sheep	Recommended	1,310.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hesonemagnificentbastard/	This game is like doing cocain. When you first start it doesn't seem very appealing, and maybe it hurts a little. But then you experence this rush, and you have to have more. And the more you do it the better you are at it. You know it's taking up all your time, and you try to stop. But the game exits, and you stare at your desktop. A tear falls from your face as you hit "play" again.10/10 would get addicted

Ack4orge	Recommended	7,667.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ack4orge/	Date of Review: 9/27/2014CSGO is a competitive team based shooter with highly refined mechanicsThe Good:    (+) Gunplay is based on skill. Knowing how to control the rifle is the difference of winning or losing a gunfight.    (+) All weapons are balanced in the sense that they each have a time, situation, or role that they should be used in.    (+) Movement is fluid and precise and if mastered, can give you a competitive advantage.    (+) The competitive maps have been tweaked specifically for competitive play in mind.    (+) Competitive isn't the only game mode. There are also community servers which host a variety of game types that are fun and interesting.    (+) Game overall takes skill to do well. It's not so easy to learn, and very difficult to master. This makes it pretty addicting when you're trying to improve your skills in the game.    (+) Chickens.The Bad:Honestly, there's not really anything negative about the game in my opinion. But I'll just address the common complaints of CSGO.    (-) CSGO is hard. Seems like every bullet misses when you're aiming right at the guy. (This is where you would take the time to learn the game, but otherwise a common complaint from people.    (-) Hit-reg is messed up. I always see the blood splatter but it never counts as a hit. (This is just a problem with the default 64 ticks server. You can join other servers with 128 tick to get better hit-reg anyways. It's still better than the 10 or 30 tick rate that Battlefield and Call of Duty has though.)Well that's all the good and bad I could think of for CSGO.Ack4orge Rating:10/10PerfectWith the perfect tweaks to the gunplay, maps, movement, and gun balance, it refines the already highly refined gameplay of the past Counter-Strikes that's been out since 1999, making this one of the best competitive team-based first-person shooters on the market.

I had a lot of fun, but with the release of the glove update, I understood, that CS GO community and Valve no longer care about the players, and are just in there for the money. In every game there is a 90% chance that you will either get a cheater or a smurf, and what does Valve and CS GO community do about it?? they release new cases. Before this game used to be fun, and after a hard day, I would come and enjoy a few rounds with my friends, but now instead of fun I get stressed with all the cheaters. It is really sad to watch a downfall of such a gaming giant as CS, but this is was greed does to the best of us.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND TO PLAY THIS GAME

I think they should nerf the sniper because people can kill me in one shot even when i buy the helmet!  This game is very tough but fun.  I heard that the pros warm up before their matches by playing minecraft so that's what I do too.
Mr. uLLeticaL™-S-	Recommended	4,970.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/uLLeticaL/	Must buy if you love FPS games!This game is all about personal progression, since it comes with a high learning curve, it's not about unlocking some stupid grip or scope for your gun. It's about you, that has to learn.The game is updated almost once a week with new features and content, Match Making is great when you are playing with friends.The real game for people that love to play competitively, with a team or just solo. There are also casual game modes available for the people that don't like to play competitively, such as Arms Race, Deathmatch, Hostage and Defusual missions which can be played on casual style, or mostly known as public or community servers. These modes are great to learn the game, and improve your play.Pros.◘ Match Making.◘ Skill levels and ranks, play against players of your own skill level.◘ Competitive scene, with ladders and tournaments.◘ The CS feeling, transition from older CS games to CS:GO isn't that hard.◘ Most old maps from CS, are in the game.◘ No perks and other unnecessary clutter.◘ Great spectator sport, easily to understand and interesting to watch!◘ No pay to win model, all items are purely cosmetic.Cons.◘ Match Making 64 tick servers stability could be improved.◘ Game could use some optimization here and there.◘ Cheaters now and then, but that's online gaming for you.If you are looking to improve your aim skills, try out these maps.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=243702660http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=419404847http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=330746573http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=379868494

I was playing with my friend who just started a game, and does not have rank, so we could play casual games only. The enemy team thought I was cheating (even though I have 20+ screenshots on my profile with my rank), so one turned his/her hacks on, and... you know the rest.

:Re	Not Recommended	1,289.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198344555716/	CS:GO, I mean the game itself is very fun but there is a huge issue that makes the experience so terrible. Once you reach a decently high rank in matchmaking that is Legendary Eagle Master and above, 60% of the games you will proceed to play will be against cheaters. These cheaters use paid cheats of atleast ($40USD) per month; and they bypass overwatch by closet cheating, which means they hide their cheats by trying to look legit. This allows them to bypass overwatch as they hide their cheats quite well and make their shots look as if it was all luck. I myself have been queued against cheaters 8 games in a row in LEM-GE matchmaking. Because of stuff like this I've started moving onto other games such as Overwatch (the game from Blizzard). I actually enjoy CS:GO more than Overwatch but the game is filled with cheaters in the higher matchmaking ranks that ruins the experience for people like myself. The situation is actually disgusting, where we now have people who que with cheaters in order to gain a high rank, because at this point if you want to reach and maintain GE you either que with cheaters or become one; atleast in the Oceania scene of matchmaking. And I forgot to mention that this is in Prime matchmaking, which is supposed to be fairly safe. These cheaters even have groups where they brag about how they cheat and nothing happens to them, even inviting more people to join them and play matchmaking while they either boost them or cheat together. CS:GO as a game is great, but I really hope Valve puts a hold on adding new skins all the time and actually makes a decent anti-cheat which bans all those external software users. Many people suggest ESEA, but there are people like me who have no interest of going pro or playing at tournaments in the future, ESEA is for people who are serious and dedicated to the game; for those who are looking to be a step ahead. I'm just a normal player who enjoys the game, I'm not looking to go big in CS, so I do not see why someone like myself would need to pay to play a legit game of ranked CS:GO. What's funny is a third party matchmaking client has a better anti-cheat than a multi-millionaire company like Valve. The VAC waves of one cheat are not enough. There are many other cheats out there and new ones are made all the time. I really like this game but at this point I feel like quitting due to stuff like this. This is why for now I won't recommend this game; not unless Valve atleast manages to actually fix this issue.

HomieRicky	Recommended	1,411.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HomieRicky/	Years of playing overrated AAA shooting games with lens flares, blood on the corners of your vision, and blue everything have since taken me away from the good old primative day of filling in the shoes of generic swat teams fighting generic terrorists; of which both groups lack the ability to look down the sights of all but a few weapons. Then I found Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Being set eight years after the events of the previous game, there are noticeable changes brought upon by the passage of time. For example, the cognitive ability of hostages have further decreased to the point where they can't walk on their own. Moreover, both the terrorists and counter-terrorists adpoted new-found language ability. Finally, as we've evolved from the black and white days to being able to see the world in color, the world of Source has evolved drasticly in it's graphics in the eight-year gap between games.Among the new things introduced are atom-wide ledges, birds of superavian strength, and a modernized Russian train station which pays tribute to the skillful, fun to play with, and polite players of the Motherland.Finally, Counter Strike: Global Offensive has gone above and beyond the expectations of being an emergant AAA title by introducing an economy system that teaches rich naive kids the harshness of the post-2008 economy. Bravo.I've only played a bit of it but I will reward this game with a 9/10 for it's advanced chicken AI and the hyper-realistic sounds they make when you caress them with knifes in a fashion akin to spreading butter.

Holo	Not Recommended	1,074.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkDreth/	I love playing CS:GO, but the game becomes literally unplayable whenever it goes on sale. After a sale hackers and smurfs grab a new copy of the game and go right back into making life miserable for everyone else. Matchmaking is useless, smurfs purposfully throw games to make sure they derank or stay at their current rank. Apparently it is unable to detect when a person destroys people at a much higher rank then him, and then throws the next game or two. No pattern at all here, but hey, let's see if we can get them to buy some skins.VAC needs major work. It's literally useless, and I feel like they've just stopped development for it. At this point it really looks like CS:GO is a dying game. It's in maintenance mode and nothing major that will really help the game and fix any of it's issues will ever be done. Sure, we'll get an updated map, maybe new skins, or new goods for crates, but we'll never get the drastic fixes that are really needed. Right now it needs the following major changes:1. Ban smurf accounts - Overwatch has taken this approach and has made MM much more enjoyable and the games seem much more evenly matched than CS. I just don't enjoy playing OW as a competitive game. It's not fun when one of your teammates needs to lose the match so he can keep his rank low.2. Major overhall to VAC - repeated small updates to counter what is currently being made by hackers doesn't really cut it. You need to get ahead of the game and make it difficult enough to reverse engineer that it deters people from even trying.3. Take community feedback more seriously - small updates that have been requested haven't happened. Some people have requested a non ranked 5v5 mode for warmups and practice. This would probably take very little work and it still hasn't happened. Some bugs have been found by YouTubers that don't make it into the next update, but guess what NEW CRATES!4. STOP PUTTING THE GAME ON SALE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD. 5. Start temp banning toxic players. Cool, you're spinbotting/smurfing... do you really need to talk♥♥♥♥♥♥too?6. Overhaul match making to try and detect when people are smurfing and purposfully throwing games and start promoting these people to their proper rank. Hey, maybe add an option to report players as smurfs or "too good". Or even see how many CS:GO accounts are owned at one location and try to take this into account when determining if it's a smurf or not (hey, it's possible sibblings have seperate accounts),I hope some of these things happen because it would make CS:GO a much better game, but I doubt it'll happen. I've been playing CS accross 3 accounts for over 800 hours and I've witnessed Valve's apathetic nature to CS:GO. Gaben loves DOTA and wants to make sure it's successful as an eSport, but at the same time CS:GO's game team has shrunk in size and been left to decline into mediocrity.

Yellow	Recommended	4,338.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YellowYT/	This game clearly proves that Counter-Strike: Source is some Outdated Junk by now, and proves that the same formula that appeared in CS 1.6 back in the day is still enjoyable, if made properly, to this very day. Even though the movement and max sharpness of the mechanics has been dulled down QUITE a bit. I used to play CS:S just for target practice when idling for random reasons myself early 2013, but this game is complete enough to drag me into it. (4K h's by now) Even though again, i find there to be a lack of optimization considering how the game ran better in 2013/2014 (early), than today. 300+ fps VS today's 200-250FPS for reference.The good old killing spree MOD from 1.6 Where you can spawn many times, which was about getting the most kills against the enemy team as a team, (A clusterfu*k without reason) and the classic zombie modes that has seen a return + a ton of other older mods from the past was/is missing though. With some returning slowly but surely however, GO is looking to become the best FPS game purchasable to this very date.Thus, i recommend this game. Something i rarely do with anything. But even more so when you can get it 50% off when steam got sales!By the way, you can get all your money and more back if you sell the stuff that drops in the game on the steam market. Which include sellings EVERYTHING. Or you can waste your money on another terrible gamble that will nver pay off because you got that extra money laying around from cases you sold in CS:GO, since when they drop related to events people pay super much for them and stuff...10/10 (My old rating was 9/10) since you can eventually get your money back selling in-game items you get for free, stuff you can pay for is pushed frequently, spicing up the game if you wanna waste some money on skins, while the rest of the game is top notch compared to today's modern sub-par competition out there. The game is brutal and made for SKILLED play though, so go figure it is in general better made VS games like for example black ops 3. CS:GO has stayed on top for 2 years by now on PC, and it is looking good for at least 2 more years heading into the future!

gwarlek	Recommended	827.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gwarlek/	Apart from being primarily a game, made for entertainment and competitive purposes, CS:GO is also a powerful personal development tool. Aside from (arguably) improving reaction times and hand-eye coordination, it teaches valuable life lessons, including the following: - It teaches you not to pay attention to other people's insults opinions. "Dude, you are so bad that last night your mom told me you were a mistake." - It teaches to keep your cool in high stress situations, when you have such an adrenaline rush that it seems to be leaking through your pores. - It improves your judgment, decision-making and learning process, because the game gives you immediate feedback for any of your actions or inactions. "Welp, shouldn't have peeked against that guy in the middle."- It teaches you to take responsibility. In most game situations, you can only blame yourself when things go wrong.- It teaches you to enjoy the game, even if you aren't winning. You can't win in life, you can only ease suffering and have a good time once in a while.Of course, as you could probably notice when interacting with your fellow community members, none of this will happen on its own--unless one pays conscious attention to the situations in the game and the feelings they elicit.

Schmoes	Recommended	403.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bashfulbritishboy/	Both the competitive and guilty pleasure in my entire Steam library, CS:GO has captured both these conflictive aspects of mine spectacularly, as I've enjoyed over hundreds of hours, playing this joyous game. From the teamwork, player rankings, campaigns, competitive gameplay, music, replay value and much more, this game is a king amongst most modern, multi-player FPS' games and still going strong even over just a measly three years.Just like its predecessors, the player assumes the role of either a counter-terrorist or a terrorist, both with their own unique missions, depending on the campaign in general. The newly added campaigns, Deathmatch and Arms race is a great exclusive extra if you're just a casual player, whereas there's the competitive session for the more experienced, intense and determined players out there.With every match starting, you're brought into ''Freeze time.'' where you have a wide selection of guns in your disposal, just ready to be bought, either with the money you've earned by killing opponents, or indeed losing a match respectively, still giving the losing team a winning chance. While with your team, you could stick together as there are power in numbers, or go alone to face your opposing enemies. I wouldn't talk for every individual player out there, as I've seen power in experienced players. Trust me, I have witnessed a Russian veteran take down an entire army of 5 opponents, all in the same vicinity...and yes, he was a rageful one, indeed.I also enjoyed the updated graphics and more immersive game environments. Definitely pushing the Source engine to its absolute limits but doesn't go too over the edge to miss the most important aspect of any game; the gameplay. The gameplay is near to being absolutely perfect, as you can easily navigate, along with the controls are fast and (sometimes) responsive, on the other hand, the radar being very relieable even in the most threatening of times, since you can detect enemies close to your location and either wait for them or hunt them down yourself or with your precious, numbered team. Just remember to tune down your mouse settings for aiming, as it does help much more.The original music used is also a big step up, as it literally puts you into that zone of actually being prepared for one living frenzy of a match, each time around. From the beginning beat as you select your weapon and gear you will bring into combat each time, or from hearing the threatening tune of the planted bomb ticking away down to its initial explosion, the music definitely makes the game feel and look more surreal than it already is. And with an added bonus, with the Steam music player at its peak in popularity, the update with the musical kit useable in-game was a great move, as you can listen to classic music, as you slaughter your opponents joyfully.I've also enjoyed the gun descriptions that tell the real-life history and origin in a very formal, informative and creative way. The statistics of the weapons also help out the player to figure out what weapon they will bring out, either if it means getting close and personal with a shotgun, sniping away with a rifle from a distance and even switching to second-hand pistols, when reloading your main gun that takes precious time, along with how they flesh out damage with a great, controlled accuracy. As you can tell, this game serves many different ideas, strategies, preferences and possibilities to each and every person who are against each other.And yet another great thing to note is that this game gets multiple, yet fast updates. The homepage of the game mainly dishes out the latest CS:GO news, such as upcoming streaming matches with clans from different countries going toe to toe, or special deal offers on those elusive cases, if you're ever tempted to test your luck and hopefully get a rare skin to add to your growing collection of weapon skins. You can also create clans and watch your ranking system build up with friends and even create lobbies to secure that you will be in the most competitive games with your mates behind your back.But my primary complaint with this wonderful game has got to be...the community. Yes, a lot of aspiring programmers and artists do a swell job at creating fantastic weapon skins and maps that when judged are simply classified as prefessional, but I'm not talking about those great people. I'm talking about the brash players that exemplify the dunning-kruger affect; where unskilled players rate their own abilities much higher than accurate and compare other players, in a much more biased fashion. It gets annoying pretty quickly, so I would usually block the most revolting swines who do this.All in all, this game is a big, big, big recommendation from me and if you think I'm lying, just check top-selling games list at the start of the Steam page. There's a reason why this game is on the high ranking list, and that's due to its high and successful popularity.

Well, after reaching the second highest matchmaking rank (Supreme Master First Class) in October 2015 and continuing to play CS:GO from there on throughout 2016, I can say I've had a lot of experience with the game. In that time, I've clocked 1.3k hours and have seen a lot of changes. It's funny really, when I consider the very beginning. For my very first MM rank, I successfully achieved Silver 1. That day I was so excited, only to find out it was the lowest rank there is. Yeah, that sort of sucked. That's not something that deterred me though, because back then, I found enjoyment out of the game and saw a lot of potential that made me want to fight to the top. So, what exactly happened which took that enjoyment away? During 2016, I continued to play competitive CS, that being through regular MM, Faceit or even some ESEA. The difference from 2015-2016, is that in 2016, I began to often take breaks. These 'breaks' often came as a result of several angry occasions where I was confronted by the issues surrounding CS. Those issues are mostly the obvious ones everyone knows about, such as the increasing amount of cheaters, lack of necessary updates, hit registration, community etc.The issues are something I wish to look more deeply into. Alongside hit registration, there is the problem of accuracy as a whole. The fact that you can have an AWP positioned on a players head and somehow 'miss' the shot, yet a player can running headshot you with a pistol is just insane. Further speaking about cheaters, there is the fact nothing is done to truly stop them. The developers of the game are greedy and they know how cheaters can be of benefit to them. When the time comes for a cheater to finally get banned, they can just go pay to get the game once more on another account. Within an hour or so of being banned, they are straight back. That's not the only instance of them being greedy. Take the graffiti update as an example. Instead of focusing on the game breaking issues, they add paints. Now, this brought a lot a nostalgia. Of course though, the first paint you recieve is awful and you have to go purchase more in order to have something that looks good. The limited use feature that prevents you having a graffiti spray for more than 50 uses just further proves of how hungry they are for money. A last point I wish to mention, is that I cannot forget about the unbelievably toxic community. I do respect this one is difficult to control though. Even despite all these game problems, I always managed to return to CS:GO. The reasons for this, as follows, were boredom, the fact that I was not too bad of a player or after I watched a Pro/YouTuber perform really well. These factors gave me the naive idea that I could once again gain enjoyment out of the game. That idea was soon shattered every time, when I was reminded of the state of the game and how it hasn't improved on any of the given issues. Huge attention comes to the game through the eSports scene or the regular community, however nothing changes. In order to put an end to the cycle I got myself in of leaving and returning, I promised to quit CS:GO for good in order to enjoy other games and activities outside gaming. I certainly had a fun time in playing CS:GO, however the increasing issues, lack of attention towards issues and the fact the communities voice is not heard, has currently killed the game for me. Who knows where things will go in the future with this game? I hope things may look up. Side note - I find it very amusing that so many of the positive reviews are full of content that is negative about the game. TL;DR - Quit CS:GO because of cheaters, greedy developers, toxic community, accuracy issues, lack of motivation etc.Small Update - 12/12/16 In an attempt to avoid any comments calling me 'hypocritical', although I will still most likely receive them, I am adding this update. Just now, I have reinstalled CS, this now being a month down the line since having it uninstalled. Whilst I have got the game back again, this review is still relevant as my views about the game have not really changed. The simple reason for me getting this game once more, is the fact I have been requested by many to play. Through requests, I have made the choice to maybe play with some friends here and there if they need the extra player. Chances are my enjoyment on the game will still be low and I do not intend to play this game regularly.

CS:GO is not a 1-day game and smurf is not an issue in the long run!Too much hatred and very less understanding community (almost all) to the point, that they hate hackers so much that they start hacking to get back at them, and get VAC banned, and then starts writing a review HERE against hackers...???? what???? Are you kidding me???  Lacking emoticons!!!  O.o  ^_^Correct yourself and make the community better!  Yes, I do recommend this.  You cannot stop hackers unless you can change the attitude!You are talking about bad community..?  We are the community ******!How to change ourselves:  To begin with..  Unfriend your hacker friend first and block him even if he just hacked once.  That is just the start and we have miles to go now!  Good Luck!

Vancouver	Recommended	2,482.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/luqmanhAKim47/	Growth is an important factor in Global Offensive, especially if you're coming into Counter-Strike fresh or after a sabbatical. This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here. Counter-Strike also tries developing into something new here as well, despite doing little to push itself beyond what it’s always done best. Global Offensive modifies old maps to keep veterans on their toes, and introduces official new modes that encourage different play styles for the first time in almost 15 years. For the uninitiated, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a small-scale, team-based first-person shooter with permanent death. When a counter-terrorist kills a terrorist planting explosives in a classic Defusal match, or a CT escort swallows a sniper round in Hostage Rescue, the victim is dead for good and doesn't respawn until the next round. As such, players on both sides must exercise skill and care. The bomb objective, meanwhile, gives everyone a purpose. Of course matches end when everyone on a team is dead, but a clever and coordinated terrorist team will give the CTs the slip, plant their bomb, and protect the bomb site. Between rounds, everyone spends earned cash on better gear and guns, and the cycle continues.

YEETMEISTER™	Not Recommended	2,039.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperYeet/	After my 2000 hours put into this game. I have come to the conclusion this game became a money pit that will never care about the people who play it. Which is why it is filled with hackers, griefers, bad servers, toxic people like the 12 year olds who get their moms card and buy it and a knife feeding the money addiction of valve. If maybe for once they listened to the community this game wouldn't be a sack of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Will this make me quit? No, because i want this game to be good but it wont be, EVER. So if youre thinking about buying it, please do not, save your money buy something worth your money like PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS which is killing every game out their. Look what happened to Shroud he quit Cloud9 to stream BATTLEGROUNDS and go further with his streaming career if you think you will be good enough to be pro, youre wrong you will never get there with the state of this game. Hitboxes are trash. Tick servers are bad. The community is garbage. The only way to play this game anymore is with a third-party service like ESEA because the people there really care about this game, and they know how to use good servers with 128 ticks. The only way this game with continue to live will be if they actually change things with it, But with valva that wont happen it took over a year for a new operation and only ever add cases causing people to waste their money on the rigged case system because they wont show their odds but ban the case sites that show the odds of the items that can be won. Yes there were scandals in the past but now people are more cautious and because of that valve is exploiting the people by making them buy their cases without giving the odds of them. This game is only there for people to spend money and make valve richer. They glove skins really? Is that a good idea valve giving people gloves. No. Stop making this game a money pit and actually do something to make this gmae playable otherwise it is dead as well as the professional scene.
Commisar Cain	Recommended	639.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076482936/	Counter strike is a lovely game with a lovely community, its a perfect place for a malignant narcissist to flourish. If you love friendly interactions from all sorts of Ethnicities then this is your game.Pros1. You can slowly get the money you paid for the game back with 1p drops in game2. If your rich you can show all the peasants how cool your knives look and make all the Russian children trade in their grain stores to buy a sand dune nova.3. Kill Terrorist ( big thumbs up from American players)4. A deep and engrossing story line and ranking system with so much context into the terrorists motivations.Cons1.Terrorists are evil and no one tells me why, the game should be more politically correct or call them freedom, fighters.2. Game is old and I cant kill ISIS, may change in the future if valve wants to make this game an immersive experience. 3. Lots of children with horrible voices that make you want to use a cheese grater on your skull.4. If you have friends you wont have them long as you will rage every time they let you die leading to you pouring piping hot tea on your sisters face. 5. All developed nations decide to allow their troops to go to battle without body Armour making them spend their salary on equipment - 40000 immersion points.6. If you are British there is a whole wealth of opportunities to hear constant slaughtering of your language and a barrage of Tea hate which will be most disturbing. In conclusion this Game is Fantastic with its revolutionary graphics, sweet jumpers for some terrorist and a real look into counter terrorism operations.

MightyHonk	Recommended	1,266.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Honketh/	Best competetive "guess where hitbox is", "99 in 16 hits" and crate opening simulator for true MLG players. You have beautiful classic 10x10 metres square maps to test your tactical genius, truely realistic feeling of shooting with airsoft weapons with stunning purple camo and banana stickers on them.   Will i eco or will i buy after lost pistol round? It doesn't matter because at "master guardian elite" level and below your teammates will buy and die anyway and there's nothing you can do about it, since they're speaking on horrific Lovecraftian languages. Good thing skill levels make a difference and ELO works in team games, right? You just have to reach Global Elite or train your real life friends in special camps for 5 years to have competent teams and enjoyable rounds.  You can play on Dust 2, Mirage or Cache, because search for other maps takes forever, which is good because these  legitimate tournament maps don't reward people for "suka krisa" gameplay.  Weapon spray act just like it should: it works in preprogrammed pattern so you must remember spray of every weapon if you want to kill♥♥♥♥♥♥ because if you just sit with ak and shot static target right in the head, you might actually miss! It aint 1.6 anymore, scrub! It works kinda like japaneze Touhou games: you play for 100 hours to remember every pattern and then you're good to go to play on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ competetive servers where hitboxes travel in outer space and none of it actually matters.  Anti-cheat system works like a charm! People can just buy csgo gift for 1 dollar at some web service, other guys can exchange it for a crate that drops every now and then, play 10 games with wh and aim and get up to "distinguished master guardian" just in 4 hours or less. Then you will be delighted to play against them as they rush middle at dust 2 making 5 headshots as fast as rmb can be pressed. But no worries! Since VAC doesn't work properly, developers added Community Overwatch where you can spent up to 10 minutes looking at some guy running at light speeds with negev spinning like a yoyo killing everything! Without even slightest reward or weapon skins you like so much you can do developers' job at cleaning off the cheaters!  As for the graphics, since Source they added motion blur.

Laptop btw	Recommended	110.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/peeanocat/	If you're doing too well, the players in the game will assume you're cheating. I find this very simple to answer why they'd think so. Because there so many cheaters in the game, some obvious and some discreet, we all tend to assume the worst out of everyone doing well in game. Because of this, it's frustrating for all, even cheaters assume others cheat. Unless Valve startes improving VAC (Valve Anti Cheat), this game is rather unenjoyable on the higher levels. It's even more fun around Gold Nova, as above that everyone's either too good, or just selfishly using cheats to up their game.Other than cheaters, I find that there isn't anything to dampen your mood when playing this game. You can choose which server to play on, through external apps.Don't rage when meeting cheaters or Griefers. We all have been there, just shrug it off and focus on improving. Or just take a break, go and meet up with irl friends. You've had enough toxicity for the day if you had 2 bad games.

PatrickS	Recommended	1,303.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/patrick508/	CS:GO is a highly competitive skill-based game. This is what makes it so great, learning the maps, all of the different tactics, improving your aim and managing the economy. This however, can be a long grind. Every map has its own calls, grenade spots to learn and positions to play.CS:GO runs great(although every updates costs FPS), has some good sound design, and decent graphics for an older game. Updates come regularly to add stuff and valve keeps improving the game. A big downside of CS:GO however is the big amount of cheaters. If you don't link your phone number to the game and play in "prime-matchmaking" the game can be literally unplayable. This can be very frustrating, especially when you're doing your best to rank up and improve. Aim and sound play an important role in CS:GO, More than in most other shooters. every gun has it's own recoil pattern to learn and it's own unique playstyle. Since CS:GO requires alot more tactics than most other shooters, aim is more important aswell. Having your crosshair at the right position means you can take your opponent down alot faster. Alot of practice, and playing aim maps helps and using your sound to locate your enemy's footsteps gives you a big advantage. The CS:GO Esports scene is also massive, milions of people follow it and it's a great place to learn. Use this to your advantage. Wanna know those new tactics, boosts and smoke/flashes? Watch some games! You can honestly learn alot from watching the pro's play. Now ofcourse, you saw this one coming, the community can be really... annoying. Especially at lower ranks the community is full of toxic kids, people who have no idea what they are doing and teammates who refuse to work together. This can be harsh, especially because CS:GO heavily relies on teamwork. Thats why i recommend playing this game with friends, and practicing alot. The faster you're out of those low ranks the better! Once you get a bit higher you'll see the community gets better and better(with the occasional toxic/clueless player ofcourse). People work together, people give usefull information and are just a bit more nice in general.Next to competitive, CS:GO also has some game-modes for people who just want to have some fun and don't care about ranks or tactics. Gamemmodes like: Gun-Game, Team Deathmatch and Casual are great for this and the thousands of community servers offer cool things like: Surfing, Aim training, roleplay, minigames and more!Now would i recommend CS:GO? Yea ofcourse! Especially for the small amount of money it costs. Just dont expect this to be another casual shooter. It's a highly skilled game and requires you to put in alot of time to improve. Pick this up with a couple of friends so there is less chance to be matched with annoying teammates.

The game itself has been ♥♥♥♥ed for years with all the cheaters, hackers and smurfs running around doing whatever the hell. The community being more toxic than chernobyl and the rage you feel after losing a couple games having the worst online experience you ever had.The more updates that come out, the greedier valve gets with it's gambling market.

lil moz	Not Recommended	4,750.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mozzahcsgo/	Seems like Valve has completely forgotten about this game. After 2.5k hours + I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have ever played. However, now I'm at the top end of the game, you struggle to find a legit game where there isn't any cheaters. You have to go to third party websites which charge monthly to play without cheaters, and even then there is still the odd few. So if you're a casual gamer looking for a time wasting game this is for you, however if you're willing to invest thousands of hours into this game to try and reach the top I wouldn't recommend it until Valve sorts out their anti-cheat (Which will never happen).Keep adding Stat-Trak music kits and gloves to a 64-tick broken game Valve.

Ÿ_Ńŏ_Łų˅	Recommended	1,969.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YNOLUV/	Hello and welcome, new player. Allow me to reveal some of the likely outcomes of you purchasing this game:The 'Cannon Fodder' (40% of all players) - Never really good enough to make it past Nova 3, constantly flaming, talking sh it, changing their names and pictures to things increasingly racist, blaming hackers, smurfs, lag and weapon choice of oponents for just what is a mixture of adderall exhausted reflexes and having a shi tty gaming rig from 2002, frame dropping on source games. Can be easily identified by it's trademark defence mechanism, when being called out for being bad the Cannon Fodder will attempt to convince it's team it has been 'Trolling' all along.Habitat: Dust2The 'Enthusiasts' (30% of all players) - A wide range of Skillsets from Nova Master to around Legendary Eagle, these players can perform consistantly and at least show a basic level of human decency,  most of them will give an unenthusastic hand job for $2.49USD because they feel they are 'due for a knife' or because 'my friend told me he had a feeling' Will one day be doing unspreakable things for a japenese businessman on a glass coffee table to pay off gambling debts that can be traced directly back to a greedy cu nt and his case racket.Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, CacheThe 'C unts' (15% of all players) - A curious breed, come in two distinct flavours 'Hacker' and i mean legit hacker, not hacker because he saw your shadow in bedroom on dust2 and prefired you, you fuc king mook, These are players who either used to or almost fit into the 'Enthusiast Category' and were turned into soulless, spineless dic kbags who cannot win on skill or merit. The other flavour, less cancerous but just as annoying 'Smurfs' people who play at levels far beneath there skill to boost their friends, ruin other peoples day for the joy of being a cu nt or to boost their dwindling ego that is one Sylvia Plath poem away from a stomach full of painkillers in the bathtub.Habitat: Dust2, Nuke, Mirage, Cache, Train, Overpass, Inferno, Cobblestone, Office, Assault, Any Operation MapsThe 'Pros' (15% of all players) - Professional Esports player OR someone who has played enough CS (usually in excess of 2500 hours - 16 weeks to us humans) to get to a level where they know every smoke, every flash, every angle, every strat on every map and to you i say kudos, kudos on mastering a video game to the point you know it as well as your mothers disappointed face when she looks at you knowing that while normal people are studying, working or contributing to society in someway, you were hunched over your keyboard for the 7th straight hour of the day, mouth breathing in pleasure as that voice says 'Counter Terrorists Win'Habitat: Mothers basement11/10 would play again.

Killu	Not Recommended	2,367.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Killu2018/	After 2300h my final review.This game is fun to play with friends on a private server.This changes when u play competitive.8/10 games u will have to deal with cheaters.Each update valve brings out, changes the game for the worst.Instead of working on a solid anticheat mechanism, theyconcentrate on creating cases, filled with skins made by the community. The prices for most skins are insaneand totally unrealistic.8$ for a game, but 2000$ for a texture ???Good job valve at creating money from nothing,and letting little kids get addicted to gambling.CSGO was more fun, without skins.Skill ans sportsmenship should count.But instead: Fancy skins and cheats dominate it.If you never played CSGO and arent sure if you want to buy,my advice: DONT BUY!

The Brain Damage	Not Recommended	1,729.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurphy-/	This game is one of the best competitive games out their but its over the most over rate game of all time. People say its better than COD but that can only be a statement for people who play both games competitivly. If your looking for fun casual/comp game then COD is their but if your looking for a very very competitvly game with minor fun this game is for you. Also the amount of support this game gets is♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to how much money they take out of people who open cases. They never make a new map only remake ones to make it better which will take more than 10 months to ♥♥♥♥ing make and then once the new map is released it will still be unplayable. Im giving this game a negitive review as i believe its the most over rated game ever developed and comparing it to other fps's is stupid as they different.
terorie Аутист	Not Recommended	397.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/terorie/	UPDATE: The cheating problem is resolved. The game would actually make funIF IT ONLY WORKED ON GNU/Linux and macOSIt is unplayable on a mac. The FPS are just fine, the problem is the game doesn't start 50% of the time. Also, CS:GO is the only macOS game I know that fails to fullscreen right.I have very frequent crashes on GNU/Linux and The worst thing, that really made me uninstall CS is this:I was kicked out of a match because my PC bluescreen'd. I restarted it within 1 minute. But when I tried to "reconnect" I got the error "Match could not be joined / Matchmaking failed"After 5 minutes of failed reconnecting, I was banned for 30 minutes. Internet and Steam Logon were working perfectly fine. This was my first ban in 350 hours total play time. The ban wasn't my fault, and writing Steam support would take longer than just waiting 30 minutes.There are plenty of better games, most notably Terraria from Re-Logic. Half the price, double the fun. Still gets updates after 5 years without DLCs and skins.Terraria shows what the gaming industry could be,CS:GO shows what it really is~ FIRST REVIEW ~ The single-player aspect of the game is useless, the bots are so bad for this small amont of maps.I stopped playing because of too many cheaters.You can't play the multiplayer because every tenth game or some you come across a cheater.VAC is so bad, it doesn't even detect a hacker that is killing all other players in a split second.Not only is the anticheat bad, but the devs release mandatory gamechanging updates all the time. They completely change maps or gameplay without asking the community first. It's a whole other game than the first release.With every update there are 200+ exploits more.Singleplayer and multiplayer are flawed, go play some good game like Terraria and then come back to CS:GO and be shocked how bad it is.

Big N1gger Walter	Not Recommended	2,818.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112456770/	After 1.770 hours of playing this game, I think that I'm safe to say that I'm a pretty experienced player. With that out of the way this game is cancer by many reasons and I don't recommend it. Here are the reasons:1. If you are below 15 years of age and you turn on your mic chances are you are gonna get bullied instantly even though you might be good.2. The community is straight up dogs**t and will bully you, grief and ruin your already poor experience with the game.3. Almost every game you get queued up with s**theads who will grief if they start losing even though you can still comeback, causing you to derank.4. If you don't have Prime Matchmaking unlocked don't even try playing a Competitive match because you will most likely be put against cheaters/smurfers.5. The cooldown system can be so stupid at times. For example: Last game I kicked a single person and got a 24-hour cooldown.6. The invites that you get to scam sites/groups is ridiculous.7. Of course, you are the problem for all of these things.I would not recommend this game to anyone who still has a life and a solid brain

ЯΞΔĻÍŦψ	Not Recommended	3,302.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996085354/	The game is a money pit filled with hackers. The rank system is a joke.Overwatch is a joke.VAC is a joke.There is no anti-cheat system for this game.It has a tired engine. (12+ yrs)It's a game based off a skill game. Just when you master a skill or skills they just throw in another broke update and break more crap like changing the whole gun skill set (joke)Adding the R8, A gun never in any Counter Strike, Is maybe all you need to know about the brain trust behind the game anymore. Best idea ever !  (Not)I know lets add Flintlocks,Muzzleloaders,Catapult and Slingshots.They will claim to fix things like broke spawns (Dust DM spawn) still broke !DM (Deathmatch) has the Worst spawns of any game i have ever seen.After one of the great updates you will have to play through weeks of people who have pings from another planet.Random lag spikes or micro stutters, do to it's not optimized well.Could it be a good game ? yes ! If they had someone who had a brain and played it and then fixed it and left it alone  other then adding the money making garbage (I know you only care if it's a cash cow).Legit players suffer while hackers roam free. (I know you don't care cause you make more money) not banning people  hence people having so many accounts...I have 1 account and proud of it.I know people will hate on me and I don't care it's the truth.......By the way i'd spend more money through Steam but after seeing what this game has turned out to be and the stupid taxes crap from selling the junk I get from game (not real money by the way, The real money has already been taxed) and the lack of caring about hackers.    " I'll just save it".If your a legit player wanting to learn the game and enjoy the game you will be disappointed and penalized.If you a hacker or a scammer you will love this game and be rewarded.....If you look at most of the positive reviews they are from people who have close to no hours played.If you look at the negative reviews they are from people who put a lot of time into the game.(1/7/15 update)  They added gloves to CSGO... Must have been why everyone was deranking, The old ones wore out.... Can't wait for Stat Trak Clown shoes...!Once again another update this time destroying the most played map in CS. Nuke was bad enough. Old Nuke was great. New Nuke sux. Old Dust 2 great. New Dust 2 sux.You want to fix something fix the anti-cheat I mean put an anti-cheat so the game can be enjoyed.For all the noobs that cry that I have so many hours.I've played since beta so that would be before the release August 21, 2012. The game now, Is not the game it used to be. Started going down hill once they added skins, Not for Steam but for players.If it was still good I'd have many more hours then I do.And yes I still play a little when my real good friend asks me too. Other then that I dont touch it anymore.......As soon as my friend is done playing CSGO I'll uninstall....!"I never leave a friend or a man behind" (In other words I don't bail on my friends)After reading a lot of the reviews I found that so many of them are negative with the thumbs up icon. So it ends up this game receives more positive reviews then it should.If this game was left alone, With a fixed rank system "Except for the mostly ulgy skins they add for more money"  people who really cared about learning and playing like a team the way was ment to be played !This game would be great........ There is a Mute/Block for thoses who don't want to know how many times your mom has had sex with a 12 yr old. But 90% of everyone you face has brand new account and has the reflexes of god and X-Ray vision of Superman. No one gets banned. Hackers will say "I heard you" or it's "my smurf". In any case if your Global and on another account and play as a global on a nova account then your a cheater and a scumbag.The Facts and nothing but the facts........!                                             Oh did i mention the game is a joke !Changing Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's name to "Hackfest Simulator"

Scootie	Recommended	361.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ScootsieCutesie/	Note: This is a temporary review, I'm still pretty new to the game so I'll write another one when I invest/waste more hours on it-My First GameI remember it really well, because it was a game that summed up CSGO almost perfectly. Dust 2, a micspammer named "Martin Shkreli" playing MLP at earrape volume, 12 year olds on the mic and no strategy apart from "Rush B". I had no idea what I was doing, no idea about what weapons were good and bad and most importantly no idea how spray control functioned. Not surprisingly I went 1 and 13, or something like that.-GamemodesCasual is more or less a big amount of players running around with no evident strategy apart from the goal to get a good KD ratio. 60% of the time Dust 2, 30% Mirage and 10% another map such as Cache or Cobblestone. However these maps you most likely will play in Competitive, so you can sharpen your "skills" and map knowledge here pretty easily.Competitive can be amazing, and it can be terrible. It all depends on how good your team is, and how good the opposing team is.I strongly recommend you play with at least one friend who is at a similar skill level to yourself so you don't get a team full of bogans/russians/idiots/whatever.If I solo queue my team will look something like this (at it's worst, some solo queue games can be cool):MeAmerican guy who calls strats but nobody listensAngry Australian guy who yells through his mic when we loseAnother guy who never talks or communicates and has connection issuesSomeone half decent at the game but gets irritated with his team OR a 12vieOther team:Uber SmurfSomeone terrible at the game but gets carried by good teamiesSomeone in a partySomeone else in the same party who says "ez" every time they win a roundAnime Enthusiast who always runs AWP and ScoutUh, I haven't actually tried out any other gamemodes like Arms Race and Deathmatch, but from YouTube they look pretty cool. -Weapons and Strategy, Silver Style.Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Tec 9 Rush B♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Idi Nahui-Round Two: Some SMG -Round Three: AKs-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy AKs and ArmorCounter Terrorists (assuming they win each round)-Round One: Five Seven or Armor plus Decoy-Round Two: Some SMG-Round Three: P90 or M4/M4A1-S-Round Four and onwards: Someone buys an AWP, rest buy M4/M4A1-S or P90 and ArmorEco Round?

"B", "Rush B ♥♥♥♥♥", "Long A", "Short A", "A split" and that's about it.You WILL get yelled at if you use the Autosnipers, P90, camp with an AWP or "accidentally" teamkill.-Rank up SystemCS:GO has 2 rank systems, one for the whole game in which you get random items drops when you level up and one that is only applicable in Competitive which determines the skill level of players you will play with/against. Having a separate rank system for Competitive is a great idea, as it encourages players to play more and work as a team. However this can be abused, and Valve can't really do anything about it.-SmurfingA "smurf" is basically someone who is reasonably experienced at the game and  creates/buys an alt account to play against others who have a lower skill level. You can detect smurfs by looking at their steam profiles, if they have few friends, low hours in other games etc. If you manage to kill a smurf, rub it in their face. You killed someone who most likely has a far higher skill ceiling than you did, and tilting them is a perfect way to get them mad and not thinking logically. Sure its a dirty tactic, but who really cares in this game.-VAC System/OverwatchYeah not much of an expert on this one, since I can't really detect subtle hackers etc. However I think it's a little better than the TF2 VAC system, since players in the community can review evidence sent to them (if they have Overwatch) and make the decision.-CommunityI've heard many times that the CS:GO community is "toxic" and "cancer" because of the people that play the game. It's true, if you play this game you WILL meet horrible and mean people who sweat and scream when they die. But thats what makes CS:GO stand out from other games, it's much more than a game for millions of players. Many people basically spend all their time playing this game, and I don't blame them. Personally I can't get bored of this game, there is always something new you can do. Without the "toxic" community CS:GO probably would not drag in as many players as it has currently, but that's just my opinion. In game the community is very vocal, with about half the players using a mic to yell/call strats/communicate (good or bad?).-Stereotypical CS:GO players in Australia/NZ"Sweaty Nerds" who play basically nonstopUnmarried Adult Males who yell at their teammates- "Yo, this guy is literally a 20 year old male!"Guys who pretend to be girls with their profile pics but you realize they're not :/Cuties and Hotties (right here)Rich Kiddies who spend money on skins to look sexy but they suck at the game (here again...)Australian Bogans (basically Russians here)Anime Profile Pic who is really good at the gamePeople with no skins that do really well 12vie micspammers...jeez there a lot of themGrill GamersPeople who add you because of your skins and make crazy offers for them-YouTube presence/MLG CS:GOThere are a TON of amazing CS:GO YouTubers out there. I recommend you check out WarOwl, MojoOnPC, Sparkles, Nick Bunyun, 3kliksPhillip etc. The tutorials can be pretty helpful, and give you some game sense. I know NOTHING about MLG CS:GO but it seems pretty big. I basically chose a team at random, Envyus, and supported them.PashaBiceps will always be my favorite player though, since he balances out his time spend gaming with exersize to keep fit.-CS:GO Skins and CasesI've already spent around 450 dollars to buy the skins I want. Hey, it's better than wasting thousands gambling away money to dodgy websites. Also I wouldn't recommend unboxing CS:GO Cases, as you should just buy off the Community Market and not rely on luck to make unlikely profit. However if you have money you want to waste unbox away and pray for a knife/glove.-Valve/Game DevelopersEh, I've seen many reviews saying that "CS:GO is dying/Valve pays no attention to the game anymore/OMG Valve is ditching us for Dota!!" and this possibly could be true. Valve just wants money, like any business would. However I don't really any need for Valve to do much more than make sure the game is balanced and running correctly (Unlike TF2 which has a 5 man development team). Note again that this is just my current opinion, since I'm still a newbie to the game.-Friendly Aspect to the game?Knife fights mid don't really count, and the only friendly game I played was on Cache with people spraying♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on the wall. I left that one, what a surprise. CS:GO is a VERY competitive game, so I wouldn't reccomend going friendly as you'll most likely get killed and kicked. Stick to Hightower.-Overall OpinionIt's an amazingly good game, it could do with a little bit more attention from Valve but has a huge player base (constantly second most played on steam) and will not "die" anytime soon. The community is very...diverse...but don't take anything mean they say seriously and you should be gucci okay :) The game is played across the globe, hence the name GLOBAL offensive and will be for many years to come. Dayum, that was a LONG review, its just that CS:GO has so much in it to cover. It's pretty good.
Arctiks	Not Recommended	1,722.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989413584/	First of all I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood but not everything is fine and dandy and I will address some of these issues in my review. First of all, competitive matchmaking is going to be hell if you are a new player. You will not be able to take part in prime matchmaking and will therefore be forced to grind out the game until you reach rank level 21 (the level required to get prime). This won't be fun however as you will encounter either a hacker or a smurf in every other game as you climb your way up to level 21. This will not only ruin the game for you but will also annoy/frustrate the rest of the players on your team leading to an increase in toxicity down coms. Furthermore, I feel as if Valve no longer cares about CS:GO and treats it more like a money making machine than a video game. I came to this conclusion as Valve seems to be constantly releasing new cases (a form of gambling for kids) instead of releasing updates to fix the prominent issues which loyal players face on a day-to-day basis such as the terrible anti-cheat, the tickrate, the hitboxes, the shot registration and the list goes on....Recently, someone left this comment on my review, his/her name was Choinka:Screenshot of the comment: http://imgur.com/a/i80j3Comment: 'Cant unsee the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ review. Came to get a sticker pack but had to respond. Valve is working on a new anti cheat and majority of good anti cheats have access to all files in your computer, which is essentially spying. Do you really think a massive company like Valve will utilise such techniques to ban a few cheaters? And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA. Cheats is a serious big industry. Why don't you apply to Valve and make them a better anti cheat that will surely ban everyone. You talk about the level requirement for prime for new players. A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21. These scrubs don't have any idea how to play the game and end up dropping the bomb or killing their teammates. The hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either. You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.'My Response: 1) 'Valve is working on a new anti cheat': show me where you found/got this information2) 'Cheats is a serious big industry': I agree that counter-strike will never be completely free of hackers but the anti-cheat is honestly terrible and it is ridiculous at how many people get away with hacking when they are so blatant. An example that I can give is the overwatch system which leads to a game ban if the player/account is convicted from the demo. For someone to be an overwatch candidate (The Suspect), their account has to receive 11 reports in one day. This basically means that people are able to blatantly 'rage hack' in two games each day if they are playing in a 5 man as they do not fall into the overwatch pool. This is a terrible system and valve already knows as it has been pointed out to them so many times in the past and yet they have still done nothing about it.3) 'And even then, the best of the best are undetectable everywhere, even on ESEA': I know this already but you are talking about the 'best of the best' which most people won't and don't have access to. I have been playing ESEA for a while now and my point remains valid. I have only ever encountered 3 cheaters on ESEA which I reported immediately and as expected all 3 of them were banned in the following days. (THIS IS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE)4) 'A new player should not queue for competitive before even reaching level 21': What sort of point is that? I'm pretty sure you queued a game of comp before reaching 100 hours in-game? xD. Furthermore, there is a competitive rank that is catered towards new players, its called silver....5) 'hitboxes aren't even that bad, people in games like overwatch seem to not care at all, where the hitboxes are much much worse. Hit reg isn't bad either.' I also play overwatch and I agree that people don't really give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about the hit reg, but overwatch is not CS:GO and CS:GO is not overwatch. In overwatch the terrible hitboxes have much less of an impact on winning/losing the game than in CS:GO where one shot could determine the outcome of a round which in turn could determine the outcome of the entire game. An example of this is allu's shot on short (dust 2) which missed when it should have hit and ended up with NiP losing the game. Furthermore, if you want more examples of the same thing, take a look at the thousands of videos on youtube which demonstrate how terrible the hitboxes/hitreg is (A huge part to do with all this is the 64 tick servers).  6) 'You're just looking for excuses to hate on CS.' That is not true at all, this following quote was taken straight out of my review: 'I would like to say that I love all of the counter-strike games (CS:GO, CSS and CS 1.6) as they have all been a huge part of my childhood'. I am not looking for excuses to hate on CS as I love the game but am instead picking out and addressing the issues which I face whenever I play the game. Regards,Arctik.

Connor	Not Recommended	3,954.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/c0nc/	First of all, I have a large body of hours on this game. I've seen multiple game breaking updates, e.g. initial implementation of the CZ-75, Revolver, (at the time) massive change to game sounds, slowing down awp scope speed, super fast crouching scout running and many more. However, a lot of issues exist, which valve refuse to acknowledge as issues, e.g. no perfect first bullet accuracy (hearthstone RNG), one way smokes, the terrible UI when watching demos, how every update ensures my 1080ti and i7-7700k can barely run CS:GO at 250fps, the volume of hackers on the game, peekers advantage, hit reg, inconsistencies in the game's playability between resolutions, re-doing maps and not testing how well they run, making people with lower end rigs drop below 50fps, molotov's random spreading, pistol damage and mobility, and gosh I could go on forever.But to be fair there has been multiple positive updates: Getting rid of the fire car on dust 2 long. That's all I can think about at this moment. But I'm sure there's more.However, I have to play this game:1. because I have skins that are worth more than my petty existance, 2. There's something addicting about being british and joining a game and speaking with an accent,3. On the occasional games that teams are balanced and there's no cheaters, they have been known to be fun (I swear),4. Every other shooter is just boring cos of the huge player base on counter-strike,5. I have invested so many hours in this game, I just don't know what to do anymore.
shevijs <3 S1mbaa	Not Recommended	2,550.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shevijs/	Its been 3 years sinc Im playing this game and following pro scene very closly. I guess, its time for a very short review.Heads up to the community for making Counter Strike as one of the biggest e-sports titles again.But if anything else - this game is pretty big pile of crap. IIRC, its march 2014, sinc development of this game is going only downhill trajectory (CZ-75 update it is). Not only swallowing up updetes has been painful, but also watching how problems arent adressed for yeras. But when volvo try to take care of issue, you can be shure that it will be one step in the right direction and atleast 3 steps backwards (ladders and hitboxes, sound, etc.). Eventually picture makes sense - brain cell non existence of humanity has been taken to whole new level. In the end there was only one ingredient that was necesasry. Despite about feeling that this game is more like skin simulator with jackpots and betting sites within past year or so, volvo did two things right - skins and micropayments. Without necessary evil Counter Strike would be alive in 2016? Not so sure. Nonethless about game itself, its been amazing years together with pro scene, lets hope that one day this game will become a truly great e-sports title and in 2016 it will not be destroyed by someones greed and careless, because with todays features this game have potential atleast to be as good as Counter Strike 1.6 still is.

Surely if you are looking for highly competetive game, this is for you. You can compete with other players, and unlike in for example MOBA games, winning 1v5 is always an option. Beacouse this is the game where your personal skill matters.But thats not the most important thing. This game teaches you teamwork, of course if you are Scream's son you can just solo win every round, but its not the goal of the game. If you solo que in competetive, you will be put in a random game with 4 random people on your team, and 5 random people in the enemy team. They can be different nationaliy, have different characters and react to things differently. But for the time of the game, 4 of your teammates are you best friends. You are supposed to watch their back, coordinate tactics to execute best situations for winning a round and communicate as much as possible.Of course you can have a bad day, and meet 4 people that will not speak your language, will have a bad day as well and will try to grief you and loose the game on purpose. But thats just a rare percentage of my personal experience. You need to always stay positive and calm, and so will your team do.When it comes to game mechanics. CS:GO isnt very complicated, but its very original compared to other FPS games. You are aiming your crosshair at a guy, holding that left mouse button like there is no tomorrow, but you are still not hitting ? Try chilling out a bit and just tapping that mouse. Dont run when you shoot, stop, aim up, fire. Its the way to go in CS. You will get frustrated a lot, you will curse, throw your screen out of your window, but dont worry: When you master the game, there is no better feeling than headshoting an awper with a deagle, trust me.I mentioned a deagle... but there is a high variety of weapons in this game. Pistoles different for certain situations. Shotguns, SMGs, Rifles. You can even have your own Light Machine Gun ! But choose the negev, since m249 is worthless. Always felt MLG quickscope power in your veins ? Buy an AWP and the power of one shot kill (Unless you hit in the legs). Or if you are poor, just buy yourself a SSG08 and go for those tasty headshots. But to be completely honest, gun you will need to master at the first place will be AK47. If you managed to learn the spray pattern, the long range potential and the power of one shot headshot (To compare, no other rifle has that power... well except the negev and the deagle, but those are not guns you will mainly play) you should be good to go to play competetive.Competetive ? But are there any other game modes ? Yes of course. You have very old and popular arms race, where everyone shoot each other to level up the guns and in the end kill someone with a golden knife. You get the demolition. Something like competetive, but you are not allowed to buy guns, you level them up instead every round, if you get a kill. We have a deatchmatch where you can practice and warm up (And I reccomend starting the game with this), you also get the most famous :Casual. Full of unranked, new players, sometimes bored globals, but mostly people playing cs:go for fun, not for rank.Are there any other gamemodes ? This seems boring. Of course there are plenty of community servers allowing you to play Battle Royale, Deathruns, Bhop servers, Surfs, Hide n Seek, Zombie modes and A LOT other cool stuff that myself havent managed to discover yet.But wait, if the game seems that cool, there must be a catch to this. And yes there is. If you dont know russian... oh poor soul, wish you luck, since you will be yelled at a lot. You can also meet cheaters, obvious ones that just spinbot around killing you through 10 walls to boost the rank of some noob paying for it, or you can meet trying to boost themselfes with a slight aim assistance or bhop scripts, but its barely noticable. I rarely meet cheaters, and regulary fulfill my duty as part of the Overwatch.Overwatch ? What is this ? Its a system implemented in the game allowing you as a player to watch a demo of a game, where somebody got reported. And the person that got reported is the POV you will see. Its completely anonymus, but also helps catching people that somehow avoid the VAC system. But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.

Revenant	Recommended	1,929.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018245483/	I bought this game for the chickens, and was not disappointed. After exploring the countless lands the chickens have traveled far and wide, I realized their population was growing too large. The chickens had started to inhabit such horrid locations across the world, such as nuclear plants, and offices without cafeterias. I knew what had to be done. I bought a flip knife off of the steam market, and called PETA. I listened to In the Arms of an Angel in my Microsoft Professional Deluxe Gaming Chair 360 for about twelve hours with no response, so, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I loaded up de_nuke and started to put the chickens out of their misery. I cried harder that night than I have ever before. The next morning, with tears in my eyes, I loaded up Counter-Strike: Global Chicken, and I saw a new item waiting in my inventory. My Flip Knife had turned into a Flip Knife Slaughter. At that moment, I realized what a horrible thing I had done. With my hand shaking, I navigated my mouse, and uninstalled Counter-Strike: Global Chicken. I regret everything I have done. I am writing this review to warn you about the chickens, and to let you know I have made a full recovery, and that I have started my new journey in Goat Simulator. Thank you, and farewell.

It's a little hard to adapt if you come from games like Battlefield or CoD because of the recoil and no sights, but if you are dedicated, you can master it in no time.

But dont think you will get access to it easily, takes some time.Last thing i wanted to mention are... skins. And holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this like csgo has its own economy. For money you buy keys, for keys you trade skins, for skins you get skins. Since if you have skins, you must be a pro player, right ? Thats silly, but some of the skins used in game cost over 10k $ and its not a joke. You can loose money opening cases, you can get yourself this kinky knife skin you always wanted. But dont get addicted to it, since me myself spent way more money on the skins than I wanted. Well... what can I say10/10Looking forward to playing more.

TOXIC COMMUNITY.2. Very unbalanced. (a pistol can kill someone with a ak-47...3. Way to many cheaters4. Way to many Griefers/Derankers5. You're going to get dumb  kids who buy $150 knifes with there mums credit card who will call you poor... (from experience)6. No one in the lower ranks takes the game seriously which can be a big pain for new players wanting to actually play the game properly7. Only like 10-20 people work on the game. Which is why you get useless/boring updates (operation hydra)8. Valve only care about the money 9. Valve don't listen to the community who could make the game so much better but instead they put alot more money into dota 2...10. And finally but almost obvious... Valve's VAC system on csgo is just as terrible as the community.

Kassandra	Recommended	67.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071261935/	My brother is an "avid amateur chess player". That's how he describes himself when making small talk.You should see his room. It's full of dumb chess pieces from different sets, like his favorite Gold Pawn. It's not really gold but he claims it is. (Nobody believes him)So anyway, one time I went to his room and I saw a new addition to his collection. It was a giant paper mache bishop. Like, 3 feet tall. He obviously made it himself because it was crooked and I saw yesterday's news on the Bishop's belly.But what really attracted me to the giant bishop was its unproportionally small head. The whole thing was like a freaky baby milk bottle.So approached the artifact, and I bit the tip off. Unfortunately for me, my brother saw me do it.Unfortunately for him, I move as quick as a fox.I was a dancing blur of after image, avoiding every attack he tried to throw at me. I slipped past him and dashed straight to the safety of my dad's room. I locked myself in until the angry beast outside calmed down.Then I asked myself, "Self, what do I do now?".So I booted my dad's PC, which I also use for gaming, logged into Steam and saw that CS:GO was on sale.I bought it. It is an ok game.

Why not Zoidberg?	Recommended	3,287.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LeZoidberg/	At its core Global Offensive/Counter Strike is a brutal shooter which in its prime was probably the number one cause of broken Microsoft mouses.The emphasis on death is probably the only aspect of this series that has kept me around. It creates an atmosphere that games like Battlefield and Call of Duty hasn't been able to reproduce. On the outside Counter Strike looks like a simplistic shooter but the learning curve is steep and will challenge even the most seasoned FPS gamer.The game is simply tactful; it’s brilliant when you’re alive and even when you’re dead the game is still fun to watch other players.Global offensive is a competitive game and a casual one, although for casual gamers it's probably better to find community servers over Valve servers. There's a huge market place now for the items in CS:GO and not only that, there's third party websites and support for numerous other avenues these in-game items have createdYou will also find on Twitch CS:GO is consistently one of the most streamed games and boast numerous competitions, if you need any convincing watch a stream, watch a competitive match and see for yourself.This game is simply a must try and a game every gamer should have in their library. Overtime you can even make back the money spent on the game from the game itself.

Can't end a game early in competitive without someone abandoning the match, in which that player then recieves a cooldown ban.

Well, i've got to say that the game has come a long way and has vastly improved from it's release version.The game is basically 1.6 with improved graphics and mechanics. While it still needs work in many areas, the current state of the game is highly enjoyable and worth the mediocre price of $14.99.If you're a long time CS player like me (Beta 1) and don't have this game yet, add me to your friends list and we'll reminisce about the old days and maybe i'll throw a copy your way.
Rose††a S†oned	Not Recommended	959.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/missvendett/	HI!I was playing Counter Strike, while 2 kids were flooding/ spamming the mic, in a language I did not understand, which obviously wasn't English. In this specific game, I was leading, and the team was winning. So I asked them to be quiet, and suddenly all the team decided to kick me. It happened to  be that the whole team knew their language. So tell me please, why do I have to suffer from 12 year old kids/ get kicked when it's not my fault, and ruin my rank??? That's why I spent 15$ on a game and I can't even enjoy it??? It seems to me that you are running from your responsibilities, kids kicking good players, Counter Strike's poor "vac" performances, every freaking game contains at least one cheater and tons of rasist comments. And by the way, I was kicked twice because I muted my "fellow" teammates, cause they were spamming the mic, and I was kicked cause I didn't listen for their directions. It's unfeair, and due to all the hours, the money and the efforts I spent, I can't even enjoy my favorite game.

Green	Recommended	1,020.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/greenlemonade/	Whether you're a casual FPS gamer or a very competitive hard-core player, CS:GO is where it's at.  A large variety of game modes from frantic action to tactical matches that rely on strategy as heavily as skill give this title plenty of value.  There is no single player campaign, though playing with bots is always an option.  CS:GO's highly polished gameplay and graphics that look fine without being too flashy let you concentrate on playing a game rather than crazy visuals.  It can't be understated that the HUD stays very clean unlike most modern shooters (Battlefield and COD, I'm looking at you!).Unlike previous CS titles, GO includes a weapon drop system similar to DOTA 2 or TF2 but all weapons are skins and merely for aesthetics.  You can actually sell your free weapon drops on the Steam market if you're lucky!  I've personally made $30 steam bucks so far. For competitive gamers, CS:GO is one of the largest Esports in the world (and THE largest FPS).  The DreamHack Winter 2013 tournament featured a prize pool of $250,000!  It's easy to get started because there is a great in-game Competitive matchmaker that throws together teams of 5v5.  With any internet game, you're going to meet some jerks, but I've had a great experience with the matchmaker and have made a lot of Steam friends that have taught me a lot.  Don't be discouraged by the learning curve.  With great effort, comes great rewards!  Now GO buy it!!
Sin[M]	Recommended	1,406.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sin_m/	There's plenty of things to like about today's modern shooters, but Counter-Strike is the only one of its kind designed to be anything other than a throwaway novelty you replace every year.

It is a very fun game but destroyed by the community. Most people do not treat this game as fun this game becomes a battlefield of insults and lack of courtesy. In this game if you failed it at something and you die there is no forgive you will be called a noob or even worse, and probably you will be kicked from the game. And talking about the Russians that they scream in their own language is bad but I meet a lot of people from that country that was nice for me. Let's not forget the on our way we meet two of the worst groups of players: Those who do not know how to lose, and the mass of childrens who most likely they squeaky voice gonna to♥♥♥♥♥♥you off, and almost I forgot about cheaters. I highly recommend to everybody that masterpiece. During the game you will know a lot of very friendly people that will probably hate you for no reason. Maybe it's because their brains totally burned out by this game or skins, I don't know but hey have fun and like my reviev or no whatever, just leave me alone.

szpenio	Recommended	2,216.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Szpenioo/	there is no game out there that I got as much into as I got with cs:go. All started with me watching competative matches on warowl's channel. and I saw these elite players with their godlike skills and fancy new skins (the arms deal update came around). and I was like damn, I want to play like them. so I bought the game. I wasn't sucking bad because I'm a visual learner and learned most of the basics by watching the pros play. but I wanted more. I learned the spray patterns, shot a wall to learn the recoil over and over again and soon it came to the point where I surpassed all other players in casual matches with ease. the spray patterns where in my muscle memory, my reflexes with the awp improved, my nades landed where I wanted them to land and the addiction swallowed me whole. I'm going to break 1000 hours this week, I have a 300 euro inventory, a clan that get's better and better by day, a youtube channel and the best thing: endless fun. You can play gun games, awp servers, minigames, jails, hide and seeks, deathruns, aim servers, knife servers, surfs, deathmatches, demolition games and many more not considering casual and matchmaking games. And if you think you will get bored of the maps you're wrong. The maps don't create the gameplay experience, it's the players + every half a year there comes out a new operation with additional new community created maps and community created weapon skins. it costs 5 euros, but if your friend has the operation you can join his game anytime without being blocked by the game or forced to charge. CS:GO is a game that will 100 % occupy you if you're eager and competative or even if you just love community based games with a sht ton of human interactions through VoIP

Just look at Pro's like Fallen, Taz, ECT. Back to the game though, it isn't perfect. Hackers, trades gone wrong, and insulting teammates isn't the best, but those are worst case scenario's. The plus side is so much better than the negetives. Custom games you can make, friends you can type to, and the epic headshots I know you will make will blow you out of your chair. All in all, if you are looking for a shoot-em up game that includes a little strategy and a lot of fun, then you should get this game. I give it a 9/10. So what are you waiting for?

low steel medic	Not Recommended	1,850.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/somestupidnerdshit/	The game is not fun, it is not rewarding to play, you will not enjoy yourself, you will not make any significant progress in the complete abortion of a competetive ladder, and you will hate yourself because of it. You will spend your practice time either alone wishing you didn't care, or surrounded by players better than you that would rather call you a retard than actually offer any tangible piece of useful advice. You will spend your 'real' play time surrounded by people who have clearly not put in the practice you have, or at least don't seem to put it to use, and wonder why you ever bothered in the first place. You will spend yet more of your time watching professional matches and thinking to yourself either, 'I could do that,' or, 'I could never do that.' But it doesn't matter either way, because you'll never get the chance. The competition to become a professional is so fierce that you have better odds at surviving a stroll across a busy eight lane highway than even approaching the professional level.Valve is so bad at communicating with their (unreasonably dedicated) community that it is sometimes physically painful when Valve releases an update to the game. Thinking back on all of the bad decisions Valve has made with the game, and all of the (actually quite straight-forward) things that the community wants and has still yet to receive after almost five years of asking, I sometimes find it impossible to believe that people not only don't hate Valve the way that they hate EA or Ubisoft, but in fact still defend and adore them. The AWP nerf, the overpowered CZ, the overpowered AUG, the ♥♥♥♥ing R8 revolver, the timer changes, the coaching decision, the lifetime ban of players for throwing an ultimately meaningless match in a tournament completely unrelated to valve, the rifle nerfs, the completely broken pistols, the new sounds, the completely and utterly broken Tec-9, and oh yeah, the ♥♥♥♥ing pocket AWP that one shots people in the chest for $850, and the list goes on and on. Oh but, they fixed the hitboxes once and so we love them!And all of this is leaving aside ♥♥♥♥ing skins. Talk about a way to make a game immediately turn into actual toxic waste: add an in-game economy based on paying $2.50 for a spin on a virtual slot machine that will overwhelmingly contain a skin worth approximately 10% of the price you paid to acquire it. If you want a surefire way to make sure your game rakes in hundreds of millions of dollars a year and simultaneously make sure that nobody playing your game gives a single♥♥♥♥♥♥about the game itself, there's no simpler system than a virtual goddamned casino. But, you know, they made the game so, like, good for Valve! Let's have a round of applause for Valve, the company that singlehandedly turned an entire generation into gambling addicts! This game is a broken pile of neglected♥♥♥♥♥♥with no redeeming qualities, barring an unintended engine exploit dating back to 1996, that the current devs have tried their best to kill anyways.Do not buy this game if you value your time, your mental health, your money, or your morality.

A very fun and challenging shooter with it's own unique mechanics and matchmaking system.Anyone that's interested in tactical shooters will most likely buy the game, expecting a whole new experience between strategy and skill.This is where most players quit.The expectation of the looks and mechanics are the same as they have seen in either a video or stream. A youtuber who enjoys a match of solo queue.What they get:- Higher skilled players with new accounts ruining low ranks- Cheaters- A Toxic community- TrollsEvery game I have played was there was 70% smurfs and the rest trolls and cheaters. Doing all the wrong and screwing over the matchmaking system where it becomes unfair for newer people that still have to learn, as for the toxic community flaming and blaming the new ones for trying to learn the game. (votekicking)Ofcourse there are alternatives matchmaking clients but new people do a little bit know that their skill won't fit for that.I recommend you to queue with 4 friends and that you play regularly with them, that is the best way to learn and not be screwed over by a team griefer.So do I recommend the game itself?Yes, I love how you have to use both of your brain and skill to win the game.Do I recommend the game to new people reading this?If you want to buy it, then buy it, thats up to you since it's your money.The reason I won't recommend it is that it will be very hard to learn and enjoy the game. Ofcourse not everyone is a scumbag, it's just that the game won't be fun as you tought it was by these people and I don't want you to waste your time and money.

SniperFameOne	Not Recommended	2,682.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Graffiti-lover/	And so, I had played this game for like 3-4 years, had 2k + hours on it, and with my experience in this game, All I gotta say about is : 1) Stupidly "special" gameplay needed, that differs from other games! Even if they claim to have "fixed" the whole HitBox system, is still s**t! I still was shooting people, seeing blood coming out, even heard the Headshot sound, but no reg. Funny thing right? Happens... (it should not)2) One of the Worst anti-Cheat system (VAC) that even a 14 years old kid, with a really small knowledge of programming can get through that by-pass. Funny thing when they released this whole "Overwatch" thing, when you are LEM with 2k+ hours, and there's a Gold Nova 2 with 350+ hours to judge your gameplay if you're hacking or not!3) Really bad gaming community including 12 y.o. kids from Different countries , having 0 knowledge of English. Same happened with older players. Toxic players are no. 2 problem, but I gotta admit, people are Not as toxic as the League of Legends' ones... 4) Really bad servers, with the whole valve giving 0 f***s about it. (64 ticks while Every damn other Community server has 128)5) Absolutely bad Game Support (you can't even e-mail them, you have to search deep to find an address to contact them)6) SMURFS. I had played some Smurfs games on it, pretty easy and stuff, but NO worth... as I had my♥♥♥♥♥kicked from Supremes and Globals, and I was pretty mad about it, I stopped doing that! Many people just wanna show off their skill to Low rank people, are something more than Pathetic! unless you're a Youtuber and you wanna make some Funtages out of it, there's No reason to do it! And yeah, if you're a new player expect a LOT , but a LOOOOT of these f**kers around. 7) Game un-balance. Cheaper guns are way better than Expensive ones! 2.700$ 1-shot kill and 3.100$ 2-shot kill in the Head! Not to mention 500$ Tec-9 at close range! As much as the Prices are so close to Realism, gameplay is NOT! I can say that I used to have fun games 2 years ago, made a lot of friends from this game, bad as the time goes by, this game is dying and Valve is responsible for this! If a whole game company doesn't care for a game they made, that is the Most populated they ever made, then there's no reason to keep playing it!  If you're a new player , or even if you're thinking of getting this game, DON'T DO IT! Get some more money, and spend them on other games, or even Free2Play games that are actually WAY better than this... Or even just buy yourself a good MacDonalds meal. It gives you Less cancer than this game.

Tails™	Recommended	2,492.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/19647906/	Once again, Valve never fails to deliver an epic title such as Counter Strike. For years, the Counter Strike community was divided into two titles: Counter Strike: 1.6 and Counter Strike: Source. But now thanks to Valve's latest Counter Strike adition, we can finally bring back the family all together. The addition of skins are all bonuses that make Counter Strike: Global Offensive even more enjoyable, following Team Fortress 2's hat and drop system. The money being used for E-sports for the best to take place in. The competitive rank system that finally matches players equally based in terms of skill and tactic, as well as giving you the prestige for winning. The game is not perfect, but then again no game is. But what seperates most games from this one is the fact that the beloved developers of Hidden Path Entertainment are always listening to the fans while working together with the top players to try to achieve the perfect gameplay (although there are many features that could be similar to DOTA 2 to make it even better, but Valve will learn soon). Thanks to this game more and more people are joining the community of this game and we should all work so that this game, or should I say franchise becomes the best First Person Shooter series EVER!

✪ Rose-iwnl-薔薇	Recommended	763.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rosee2k/	 This is an extremely hardcore, skill-based first-person shooter, and it forces you to think differently than other modern shooters. If you’re a Call of Duty player, you’re going to need to change your play style to succeed here.Global Offensive is definitely a Counter-Strike sequel -- it looks and feels familiar, with minor tweaks here and there to help balance old issues and surprise longtime players. This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.

Not to mention the fact you can get skins for your weapons! Beyond reasonible doubt you do not need to spend anything on this game apart from the money spent buying it in the first place. For those not interest in competetive play, CSGO has many community servers available such as Surf and JailBreak.All in all its a fun game to mess around with mates or prove your worth in commetitive.

Low ranks are a bottomless pit with no escape unless you get a whole new account due to smurfs, trolls, hackers and people who are idiots. Loss after loss forever, versus 5 cued smurfs on the other team or hackers.So you would think, after spending CASH on this game, that I would be able to play with my friends, right? I bought the game for that.Nope! You have to play 5 hours of casual. During which, people micspam racist music and other things, act toxic, insult, etc.After that- Things will get better, right? Nope! Low rank matches have hackers upon hackers, smurfs upon smurfs, and you get loss after loss as you're trying to learn the game. Why would Valve increase the price of their game or IP ban hackers? The hackers buy the game for $15 again and again, to troll 2 to 4 matches, then get banned, and repeat. And repeat. So why would they stop if it makes them money?I would much prefer to spend $60 on a game I know works than $15 on a game that is nothing but aids and racial slurs.Once you win 10 comp. matches, things get better, right?Nopity Nope! You get banned for a full 24 hours FOR WINNING. You have to sit there AND WAIT and can't play comp again!Add a new paypal account? Great- you can't trade items for 6 days!Just got the game? Great! You can't sell or buy items for a full month!Everything about this game treats new players like they're cheaters/hackers/smurfs/trolls, while allowing experienced players to do those things with little effort. Very steep learning curve that is not helped in most ways, very toxic community, very fustrating game mechanics, server performance getting worse every day- rubber banding at 65 ping, if you have more than 250ms ping you teleport all over the map and can do nothing at all, and on top of it all- you get banned just for WINNING. As well as abandoning.Would not recommend stay away, you have been warned.

O.K K.O THE PORN MASTER!	Not Recommended	82.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bottle_Brainiac/	CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your "teammates" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, "why does this random delph still play it then?" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need "teamwork" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.

I won't say only good stuffs about this game ! ^^I wanna insist on the fact that the game is only $14,99 and can lower to 7~8 in Steam Sold! :)The good stuffs about CS:GO:- As far as we know, CS:GO, in contrary to most of FPS games, is not a Pay²Win.The only few stuffs you can get are skin stuffs. (Weapon cases, skins, keys...) which is only useful for cosmetic!(I beg you to not judge people that pays skins.It's like judging people that buy games massively, have knives collection in real life, car collection... or even just even buying games at really high price that are not worth it! ^^)Which can be nice to have too! :D- The game is based on real skills.Bye, bye, games with broken weapons only with Zomms on it! (Even pistols :P) There might be two or three weapons that way, but not every weapons has one!The whole game would only depend on your skills that you'd grow by time!Your reflexes, your precision, hearing where the enemy steps are perfectly, the weapon shots are master words!- Many maps available.The rank system 5v5 allows you to chose any map you wish to play one what is available.Most of them are balanced, some a re not either. But there is always a way to be good at both sides with a few trainings!- The Workshop allow the community to make many maps to train your skills and become one of the best player of CS:GO!Headshots, perfect spray, and every kind of training that would make you a better player!- New cases shows up regularly in game.Players can drop them in game (normal or ranked one!).What's the good point about that?If you drop the in the first hours they show up, you can sell it until $30! (Yes, I saw that! :P)And then, when it spread itself more, the cost would quickly lower to around $8.And one week later, the price would be around $1.So, try your luck on the first days!- Last part of the good points:Rankeds are really nicely optimized.One game 5v5, you can kick negative players.If they are an AFK, he'd be auto-kick after 2 or 3 games.If you don't want to wait, you can kick him.Otherwise, he may comeback in the 5 next mins. ^^If he doesn't, oh well he gets a ban.The Team-Kill system is kinda stupid.You can kill your teammates, (which can add difficulties. Which is understandable.)But, of course, it becomes a ban reason. If you kill 3 teammates (or if you do too much teammate damage in a short amount of time) you'd get banned.The bans system work that way:1rst ban: 30 minutes.2nd ban: 2 hours.3rd ban: 1 day.4th ban: 7 days.Do not worry, there is no permanent ban!The next ban could be just a little 30 mins even if you had one before! It reset itself after a little amount of time being clean. :)(Those bans work the same for when you leave a game ^^!)  Negative facts: - I'm gonna make it simple..Of course, one of the major problem of the game is, the smurfs and the hackers.Most of time, they are smurfs (coming from the Rank Supreme or Global which are the highest) that have fun to play against Silvers on another account.I don't find this funny because that happen almost everytime. ^^But, don't give up!Just because they are smurfs in enemy team doesn't mean you can't win.Every players have a weakness. You just need to find it.- Les hackers.Bien qu'il y a un système de VAC, souvent des hackers ne se feront pas arrêter.Heureusement, cela ne se passe pas dans chaque game donc en général vous pouvez jouer paisiblement.Et s'il y a un hacker, y'a des chances qu'il se fasse ban pendant la même game.- Hackers.Obviously, they are a VAC system. Most of time hackers doesn't get arrested by it.Gladly, you don't get to see hackers every game anyway. So, in general, you can play peacefully.And if they are an hacker, they are some chances that they gets banned while you're playing the game against them.- Some players ruining the community.Most of players would say that it's Russians or Polish players's fault.But they are not only them.Lots of french, lots of germans, lots of portuguese..It comes from everywhere!There is no perfect community.They are only mentaly disturbed people. oAoThanks god, there is a "Mute" button! :)Anyway! I am gonna stop here. There is lots of stuffs to say about this game but it's already a very long review! :)Good luck, have fun to the few people remaining that are going to buy the game :)

This is an incorrect way to combat fraud because it creates problems for players and users of Steam. This update will have a bad impact on the market & on the reputation of the game. Online indicators will fall with sell graph. Nobody expected this update. It is very uncomfortably. All of us is asking to return old trade rules or at least short ban to 1 day.We hope you will hear us. It is very impotant for us.Thank you.#FREETRADE#STOPTRADEBAN

FistOfPuberty	Recommended	943.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chainj/	CS:GO is a game which was once designed around team-based attacks and defenses, something which has since been replaced by weapon reskins and recoil patterns.Pros: ¤Very easy to hop into a casual game and enjoy a quick game.¤Very easy to join a competitive game and work with a team of nearly equal skill-levels in a longer game with higher tensions.¤New game modes to choose from.¤Wide variety of powerful weapons at your disposal.¤Betting scene.¤Numerous competitive leagues and teams for highly skilled players.Cons:¤Difficult to master weapons and recoil patterns.¤Luck plays a considerable role in fights.¤Learn a plethora of new insults from teammates.Conclusion: For 15$, it's worth every penny.

O.K K.O THE PORN MASTER!	Not Recommended	82.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bottle_Brainiac/	CS:GO a game, that forces you to blow.Counter strike global offensive, is a sequel to a game not many mention, that is the more tame and passive counter strike source, or at least by comparison. When you get CS:GO you will immediately know, that you're gonna be bad and quickly get mad. And if you aren't aware of the haulage of rage in less than a minute, your "teammates" will acknowledge and flip it on.Never in my life, have I been in a situation where I wanted people from another nation to be on my team. Because with most of the american players, they do nothing but add layers of irritation and stress, mostly screaming kids or random mooks making bids for weapons while ignoring their dames, when they should be playing the game, that it causes such a mess.The main game is all the same. If you're a terrorist your goal is to blow up things, like a horrible chemist. If you're a counter terrorist, you'll find yourself defending one of two spots like a minimum wage therapist. Both teams do have an alternative option, that they aren't too furtive about. Everyone usually goes for this route, and just kill everyone on the other team without a doubt. This game is not new user friendly,  I dare say it is quite deadly to newbies. To sum things up, before I get mad and break a cup. It feels like everyone is a 5 year veteran, but you are some poor letterman that gets headshot instantly and spent more time dead than alive. Your accuracy is off like a dead battery, but every bullet from each enemy is specially graced by gaben to carve a mullet into your skull. It doesn't help, that this games community is rancid, if you dare yelp everyone will shout at you like you're a whelp. Not to mention the huge amount of smurfs, that make you feel like you're in detention. Don't even bother unboxing, because it is outright mocking you what little difference it makes. All you can get is a skin, which is as worthless as the bin you'll put it in. All the guns work, but apparently aren't as fun without bright colors stickers glowsticks or prickers. And don't dilude yourself that if you keep trying you'll get a knife, it'll be a very pitiful strife. And the worst part, that makes the first statement of this review meanginless?  This game makes you always feel bad, I rarely see anyone glad to be having fun at all. CS:GO makes you feel like you blow. There is one thing that is a big deal to the smurfs, that they gladly take and seal. But the problem that always hits without fail is, this game is always on bloody sale. So for 40 bucks, the average chucks can have about 8 accounts. So even if they do get a ban, it'll literally be like you threw a rotten tomato at a fan. Just more of a fuss that oozes from this toxic community, like a wound full of puss.You may ask yourself, "why does this random delph still play it then?" The answer is simple, like connect the dots with dimples. This game has challenge, and does need "teamwork" to make you do better than an allonge. Which you'll rarely get alone, it cannot be done. Bring a friend, because in the end it is better to suffer together rather than alone.Otherwise can't recommend.

How long can one game have its main mechanics be broken? Tickrate, hitreg, hitboxes.. Ehh, doesnt matter right? All we need is some new sounds and sprays. How long can the devs not find a proper way to fight off cheaters? VAC? Very Annoying Comedy? It can barely ban the obvious cheaters. Prime? No one actually cares and is cheating/smurfing anyway.

Punchbowl👊	Recommended	242.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PowerPunchBowl/	Probably my favorite in the series thus far. The weapons are far more balanced, there are more reasons to use grenades other then flashbangs and the gameplay on the whole feels more refined.It's still Counter Strike to it's core, but it shows Valve isn't afraid to risk♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off their fanbase to release a new one.
iso.ba	Recommended	2,921.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iso_/	Great 10++
Whis	Not Recommended	2,009.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/whisespoir/	Community is the sickest, so here I have examples of any type of players:Silver haters. The matchmaking system are combine players in accordance with the skill group. People have found it fun to create a general idea of silvers as a garbage without brains and skill. For someone it is an accurate description, but not for all. Ranks are not for showing off.Boosted ones. They are too good for this world, they are smart, handsome and incredible. But Gold Nova 2. And they think their peoblem is always with teams that not_so_good. Eventually they are ruining games with their conceit and lack of experience. Skin haters. People that consider it's their business to count other people's money. Also, they are confident high price skins owners are bad because... IT IS FUN TO MAKE A MEME "GE INVENTORY (pic with sand dunes) /SILVER INVENTORY (pic with knieves). Ha-haaa, dem memes...BOT lovers. Some people think the BOT will be better than the player that didn't clutch the round with 10 hp left and all enemy team alive.Common idiots. Actually press f1.I WILL FIGHT TILL THE LAST BREATH ones. For some reason they never surrender. A competitive game is played between the teams of 5 players. If one of them leaves the game prematurely, he receives a penalty, and the team devoid of player has the right to end the game in advance. Valve gave them this feature, but they prefer to waste time and lose because of the numerical superiority of the enemy team.Tryhards. Goes without any words :>Team players you can count on. People that will give you info AND call idiot, noob, retard etc. at the same time, when they're already died and whatch you. They don't know what morale is. And manners.The community most valuable members. They want to be the bride at every wedding and the corpse at every funeral. This is not about CS:GO only. If you have a negative review, they hint you correctly you're an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, that can't handle the game, even though you have 100% fair achievements. If you want to take part in a discussion, but don't know some things, they won't explain it, they are likely say "go away" instead. Ultimate pro gamers. For example: you lost the round 1 by 1 with the enemy, because couldn't handle aim? Dead one pro will cheer you with the words "omg what an aim noob" or something like that. I don't know where they take such a weird ideas of omnipotence or invincibility... Everyone have equal abilities here.Smurfs. People that find it fun to play with people that can't resist. Welp, as you see, nothing in this community is friendly.Russians. Do you think I forgot?) Russian ones are odd. They always ask this question "Русские есть?". This questions is very mystical, because even if they get positive answer... they keep silence. So, do you want to met... or you just show off your nationality? I know russian language and I know what russian think of USA* (English-speaking people=Americans*), they are not silent about it. Thank you for your attention. Now you know what Counter-Strike: Global Offending is.

They will ridicule you for your every mistake, loose your games intentionally, and try to break you down. The problem with the community is not everyone, but is a large enough population to effect you.
Pepper	Recommended	344.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Koobyin/	Well I have 200+ hours on this game, and I don't know why but hey, here's a review.Pros:+Has the option of competitive+Fairly Balanced+No Game Changing items+Fair Economy (Skins and Items)+Easy to setup (Lobbies with Friends, Custom Crosshairs/Changing Viewmodels)+No way to gain an advantage (Except Skill)+Good Anti-Cheat and Overwatch+Teamwork is neededCons:-Very Toxic, occasionally helpful, community. (Full of Trolls, Ragers, ect.)-Some weapons can be used so abusely and unskillful as it makes the game unfair. (P90)Edit: This can be combatted by approaching the P90 users from a position that gives you an advantage. Credit goes to Bunnikinz! Thanks for the advice!Neutrals:(Depending on how you see it, it can be viewed as a pro or a con)=If you disconnect from a competitive match, you have 3 minutes to get back in or you cannot get back in even if you do get back on. (One of my friends computer bluescreens occasionally during comp and his reboot time isn't enough to get back on time)=Ranking System, the ranking system prevents smurfs from appearing as often but gives the new player a huge grind before being able to play competitive. (Smurf = A skilled player, usually of the ranks Distinguished Master Guardian - Global Elite, who makes a new account to play with lower skilled players often ruining the game for the opposing team.) Also as you move higher in the ranks you will find more hackers, especially in Supreme First Class and Global Elite games. What most players do is go on ESEA servers where their Anti-cheat is a bit better than Valves.Final Verdict: 9/10 although the game is really good it does has somethings I'd like improved.What I'd like to be improved that can be fixed:+Report System, As much as the VAC system is good, it's always going to be flawed as it won't be able to detect a hacker 100%. Valve is trying to fix this with Overwatch, a system of which hand-picked players (usually high ranked and have many hours in the game) review a demo that is recorded of the game of whom is reported from and votes on whether the suspect is either hacking/greifing or not. What most youtubers who record Overwatch and people who use Overwatch want, they want to see what the suspect is reported for as when reporting someone you're given three options: Hacking, Greifing, or Other. This allows the reviewer to look out for what is the player is reported for making it justifiably easier and more accurate.Note: As I put more hours into this game it will advance, so this review will be edited in the future for it to be more accurate.

Fargo	Not Recommended	1,736.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaptainFargo/	Updated review for 2018: Shocking amount of cheaters. I didn't even bother to play ranked but casual was pretty much a cheater a match there. Don't see any signs that this will change. The community servers are a sad sight as well. I couldnt find more than a hand full of community servers that weren't DM or jailbreak or something along those lines.Old review: We all got here in 2012 and were like: "It's great fun but pretty rough around the edges, but I'm sure they'll fix it up and it will become a great game" They didn't fix it up. Many of the things that distinguish GO from the other games in the CS series are its worst features. The player speed, acceleration and accuracy values, plus hardly any tagging (player slowing when shot) caused the adad technique where the player strafes one way then changes direction giving him a second of accuracy where he takes some shots. What this, plus horribly broken cilent-server hitbox sync translates to ingame is spamming the strafe keys and hoping to land a shot. All this gives us a CS that values frags over brains. As I said we thought back when the game was new that all this would be polished out, it was not.Did I say horribly broken hitboxes?http://youtu.be/TQmrajx7Xrshttp://youtu.be/H1lblTOV1mghttp://youtu.be/cAxaaGXtmcE They haven't even had a real bug patch in over a year, you'd think you were playing a 10 year old game by the support it gets, not a 2 year old game that gets 5 million unique players a month and valve's "don't call us, we'll call you" policy only makes it feel worse.Did I mention the game is full of cheaters even up to the highest level of play?Kill me.
Kaitten	Recommended	248.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaitten/	Awesome game, has a real competitive feeling and it's actually quite fun with the right players but on the other side it's really annoying when it comes to the fact that there's 90% of players in the game that are mentally ill, bad-mannered, and have some sort of itch to insult and mock females for their own pleasure, and lastly the rank disappears after a certain time of inactivity, sadly it doesn't just disappear but also your rank decreases a bit far and you'll have to climb up once again! In general I loved it, and I've always had fun playing it especially that I'm usually queuing up with my girl even with some of the horrible sides of the game I still recommend it mainly with friends!

D3fyant	Not Recommended	1,632.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/d3f14n7/	First Off... Im not sure when Trolls, Smurfs, and Hacks began to become the norm, but the game is broken.They put it on sale for 5.00. Kids buy it just to hack it. Valve knows, they dont care. And all we do is BUY BUY BUYskins. I mean 400.00 for a knife skin? WTF?!??!!? Didnt we used to be able to get those for free?  The guys hacking have a customer service number to call if they cant set it up correctly. Hacking is Big Business. They took 12 name tags from me, all because of 1 off-color gun name. Meanwhile, vulgarity far worse than my gun name, is allowed to cheat, troll, and make the game unplayable. Because its funny to watch people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ And valve does nothing but put the game on sale. And kids, Rememer. When you tell ghame developers that your ok with paying 65.00 + 35 or 50 for the "season pass".  You set what the market will bear. Thus making games MORE expensive for us, and limiting how much fun you can really have with it. Cuz if you cant afford the season pass.. you dont get all that content. CSGO is setting an example of how to take all of your customers money, and make them happy they did it.Maybe they put it on sale so that you can afford to have 3 copies of they game. 1 for rank, 1 for smurfing, and 1 for hacking...

Ranch	Not Recommended	410.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MysteriousRanch/	I put a lot of time into this game and I got pretty decent at it, but it got to a point where victories were no longer satisfying and losses were usually the results of really salty teammates or smurfing/scripting enemies. I have over 300 hours and I paid $15 for the game, so I no doubt got my money's worth, but half of it wasn't even enjoyable. It really comes down to what kind of matches you get put in, but I think you'll find yourself getting annoyed with the game more than enjoying it past a certain point.

CyDoN	Not Recommended	1,461.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CyDoN/	I had a lot of fun some years back in the 2012-2014 reaching the rank of Supreme mostly playing with friends but also as solo. I came back this year to try the game again after some absence from the scene. WTF has happened? This game has the worst community possible, it antagonizes the one that LoL has but I guess here things are worse. If you don't speak Russian you are doomed to play in competitive servers with people that don't speak English at all in about 80% of your matches, these guys use the VOIP system to speak Russian even if they are just 2 out the 5 players in your team, their only communication is shooting you or try to kick you if they think you do something wrong.DON'T GET ME WRONG HEREI have a lot of Russian friends through other games and they are really nice people.Apart from the Russians another portion of the community is immature people, they go harsh on teammates, bash them, trolling them and in generally trying to prove something, these disputes in many cases end up with the player being either the attacker or the defender leaving the game or getting banned for friendly fire, about 80% of the times you play you will end up playing a 4vs5 Match (at least in my DMG and LE levels that I played this year). This is a team game, you can't win by yourself but most people don't get it. If you reach a higher level of skill it doesn't mean that you are also a good player in terms of tactics and strategies.Another negative thing is the 64tick rate servers that the competitive system uses, I believe this is set to allow distant players to have a decent ping and/or to save resources for the servers. This thing ruins the game too, it makes aiming really funny, you will understand If you ever go on a LAN server or play on a 128 tick rate server, this will result into playing a totally different game. The way the rates work now is that the attacking player has always the advantage as prefiring won't leave the defender time to react.There is huge but in all this:Are you willing to pay a subscription?If you have 4 dedicated friends to play the game with I guarantee you that you will have an excellent time if you decide to go play somewhere where you pay to play like ESEA and FACEIT with a better community. There you will find descent people that value their money and are willing to play in a higher level without having to take all this *love* mentioned above.This review is written in frustration after playing 5 consecutive 4vs5 games only with non englsh-speaking teammates. And this scenario this year doesn't happen for the first time.
xilence	Recommended	3,033.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/--dx/	Really good game. Very simple, yet complex at the same time. For first time players: DO NOT let the game's recoil mechanics scare you away. It will take some time to get used to but once you do, it is a great game.PROS: [+]-Great community (COMPARED TO SOME OTHER GAMES)-Frequent updates-Tradable stuff-Source Engine means that players from GMod, CS 1.6/Source, etc. won't (or at least shouldn't) have a hard time adapting to new controls and physics.-VERY Competitive at higher levels-Tons of workshop files and tons of room to make your own skins and maps-Weapon skins -Multiple modes for casual or competitive and more-High FPS on almost any PC (great optimization)CONS: [-]-Skins can be expensive or worthless-Skins and cases can suck the money out of you if you let it-Recoil is not very easy to get used to-No aiming down sights (FOR NEW PEOPLE, CALM DOWN VETS)-Cooldowns can be handed out unfairly-Low graphic quality/detail compared to other games (IT IS SOURCE, CALM DOWN)-MP only (if you are reading this, you most likely have internet at home, THERE IS A BOTS ONLY OPTION)-Hackers do like to hack in competitive matches at higher levels-Callouts are not that easy to learn for beginnersOVERALL:Get it. If it is on sale, CS:GO is an even better deal. The recoil was my biggest challenge at the start but just take some time to practice with bots. Perfect for traders, casual FPS players, competitive FPS players, and workshop content creators.RATING:9.5/10
Etherfast	Recommended	6,790.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/etherfast/	Excellent team tactical shooter. The 5vs5 Competitive Matchmaking is the best part and can deliver hours of fun with your friends.
FLAMBUOYANT	Not Recommended	1,426.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972105519/	I used to recommend this game but I can't anymore. CS:GO is broken in a number of important ways right now: Pistols desperately need balance. Netcode and servers are horrible.VAC essentially only catches the dumbest hackers. Overwatch more or less an admission that VAC doesn't work well but is also useless. Movement speed and run-and-gun gameplay style completely at odds with theme of tactical shooter. Tapping often offers little reward for risk in current spray meta (exception being AK at distance).Jumping accuracy? ... Really? Why encourage jumping in a tactical shooter? SWEET REPLAYS!!!R8 revolver... feels like an April fool's joke that never ended and now is just sort of a troll gun.Non-Prime matchmaking a huge deterrent to new players - testing ground for hackers now. Prime matchmaking seems like an awkward fix to broken VAC and honestly still plenty of walls/etc.Smokes still frequently glitch allowing players on one side to see through them.I won't list toxic community as a negative of the game because there's nothing the developer can do about that. For all of you who want to cite Riot Games' efforts to improve player behaviour ask yourself this one question: have their efforts worked? No. League of Legends has the most toxic player environment I've experienced even compared to CS:GO or Dota2. Competitive games bring out the worst in a lot of people. That's a people problem not a developer problem. Anyway, in its current form I would not say that spending the considerable time to become skilled at this game is worth it as you will constantly be let down by wonky mechanics, bad servers, and the inescapable reality that there is a constant ebb and flow of hackers in competitive that make any sense of true competition feel absent. All in all, CSGO will have you asking yourself: am I having fun or is this actually adding negativity and stress to my life? The answer will vary from game to game but in the long run I think most people play this game out of habit rather than having a consistently positive experience.

I sometimes break my table but its ok, my mammy always gets me stuff so im good. I also break other things, but i still get new stuff.Best way to play this game is if you take a walk then do some squads and then proceed to play a little bit of deathmatch where you can hear grim russians talking a little bit of ♥♥♥♥♥ language.This is also a very good start of the day to me. I love spamming with radio commands to the point where my team tries to kick me, sadly they cant. I always play with a lad who is always there to back me up, and he always votes no so i keep on spamming radio commands! Sometimes i dont play too good but its okay i just play the next day. i like to use the sniper Ayy double you Pee <3 becauase back in the good olde days i used to play mw2 where i was a professional amateur quickscoper. There is also guns like the ak but i dont like that because the bullets go up and thats not fun for me when i shoot.i haf ben playing a little bit of cs for a while and im actually global max rank. Sometimes i get happy when i derank cuz then i can rank up again and you get very happy when you rank back up!this game is very gud if you like to meet new people and exploit other cultures cs is the game for you.ddust 2 is a good map that you should play all the time!i luv cs goOooooO♥♥♥♥ dots and commas you can put em your self if you need it.

tygah ❤	Not Recommended	1,425.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tygah/	I personally enjoy the game, and continue to play it frequently. But the point of this review system is to let people who haven't bought it know about what they're getting in to. That's why I don't recommend it. If you jump into casual to learn the ropes and play with other people there's a 90% you'll get kicked because you don't know how to play, didn't defuse the bomb because you don't know where it is, or maybe you'll get kicked just because someone called a vote for no reason and everyone hit F1 because it's a funny me me to kick people for no reason. You'll get abused over mic and text chat constantly until you "git gud", and then even when you do it will still continue.If you play competitve to try and get better and progress through the skill ranks there's a 90% chance you will get yelled at continuously if you are last alive, pointing out everything you do wrong in their eyes, even though they are already dead.This games community is absolutely terrible and while there are nice people that just want to have fun or help out new people, they are a dime a dozen.If you think you'll be fine with all this go right ahead and buy it, it's an incredibly satisfying feeling when you can play, and even moreso when you do those pro™ strats™. But for new players this is an awful game that continues to insult you until you don't want to play anymore, it's happened to more than a few of my friends that tried to get in to it.Overall, great game if you persist, terrible game if you want to jump in to it casually

bungalomaster	Not Recommended	437.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198381167663/	I can remember the days when playing this game was actually fun. Now, it simply is not. Not just in Silver league, where people either troll constantly even if you're top fragging and you're the only one actually trying, hacking or smurfing from much higher ranks.Every game makes me angry. I play against LEM smurfs, Globals smurfs, even the good ol' Silver Elite Master smurfs who still manage to destroy everyone. I spoke with some Globals and they all decided to smurf because the game became unplayable. Too many hackers trying to be bette than everyone else. The same can be said for every other tier. It is nothing short of PATHETIC. Don't get me wrong, I learned my lesson after getting VACed a long time ago, and now I'm part of the suffering demographic of the CS:GO community. Every game I get trolled. Every game I get annihilated by players who belong in much higher tiers but still enjoy destroying the players who still need to practise giving accurate callouts. Nothing I have said so far has been hyperbolized, this is actually how the game is now.Hackers not getting banned. Smurfs having fun wreaking havoc and trolls jumping in front of you every time you shoot so you kill them and get kicked. These low-lives even gang up on you once they know you're getting angry. Next thing you know you're being body blocked all over the place and the only thing you can do is beg for a kick. I don't even have 200 hours on this account yet and the past 20-30 have been nothing but the same puerile crap. 30 year old adults acting like babies. At least the 12 year olds, even with the squeaky voices and diametrical tempers, actually try to win. Every time I log on, I have a positive mindset and feel like both having fun and winning. Then I meet the 3 types of players I just talked about. Not to mention that after the game is over, you're glad because you get the part ways and play another game with other players that won't give you a hard time. Oh wait, no you don't. You get matched up with the very same players over and over again unless you take a 20 minute break to ensure that you truly meet other players. And the cycle continues.This is not fun. If you already have the game, can't say anything you don't already know and agree with. If you're looking to buy it, don't. Go play some games that are actually worth your time. Don't think for a second you'll get the same games and players you see on the pro players' videos on youtube, because you sure as hell will not. This game is no longer enjoyable. I know that I am bad and that's why I'm not Gold Nova let alone Silver 3. But at least I actually try to play the game, to communicate and teach the basics to the ones that are new to this game. How many reports have I sent out for griefing? And how many have been dealt with? I'm more than confident that the answer is not a single one. Buy the game if you want, I obviously can't stop you. But think it through. Do you want to spend 16 bucks for hours of just being constantly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off?

Prepare yourself, for a poorly balanced bug filled experience full of hackers and microtransactions. Get ready to play with Russians with terrible mics who cant speak english but who the game matches you up with anyway and 12 year olds with literal down syndrome while the game constantly shoves crates on to you to try and coerce you into gambling for silly skins and dumb stickers that cost like 3.00 bucks a pop.

Aubrey Drake Graham	Recommended	455.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Superayman2/	The only thing this competitive game has that compares to call of duty is it's FPS aspect and a few of the guns. Otherwise, it's an upgrade to the original Counter Strike, 1.6, and source with a few additional game modes and better graphics. What I like about this game above it's predecessors is it's offline bots. The dedicated fans that have been playing CS for multiple years makes the online multiplayer very difficult (which is a good thing). So, what I like about this game is the offline bot mode, which allows people who buy this game to enjoy a little pwnage (or challenge when they crank up the difficulty to veteran) when they can't get it online. Also, everyone has an equal chance, not thrown off by prestiging or leveling up, which adds balance.Overall, it's a fun, challenging, and addicting game -- I'd recommend it to all gamers! Especially those who enjoy a good FPS.

Updates were done to involve new cases to produce this company money instead of improving this game. Every other game, free to play games, bought games anything is improving and granting a better experience, while this game remains on the same point and even goes back, by those unnecessary sound updates. Cheating players continue with their hacks,  bad tickrates are not getting fixed, instead new stickers and pins are realeased. Overall this game is no more playable at all, it deserve this huge drop of players wanting to play this bad game.Will not play this again, this game is definetly done for me.

Ank	Recommended	286.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ank501/	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter and the next generation of Counter-Strike running on updated Source Engine and has many new features added.The gameplay is also has been revamped so even new players can play the game without much difficulty. No need to buy weapons ammo anymore. There are many new game modes such as deathmatch, arms race and the competitive online match. There's also the new Arms Deal update where each weapons now has many skins which can be acquired when you play on VAC enabled servers in a timed based item drops or by opening a weapons case with certain bought keys. Weapons skins can be used to show off, traded or sold on Steam marketplace. You can even change your weapons name and add some description about it. You can also submit your own weapon skins or maps if you have the creativity so that maybe Valve will add it in the next game update, therefore supporting the game even further.Graphics in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive has been vastly improved. Characters model are all fresh new while retaining the same design and faction with some new faction added. The map is upgraded even better to look more realistic than ever. The new Source Engine also made the ragdoll physic effect and many effects feels more realistic. Despite all of the upgraded graphics, the game runs amazingly smooth and optimized and doesn't really need high-end system.Oh, but before you buy this or even play the game, you better be ready to throw yourself into a real hot zone out there, as the community of this game is... well... unforgiving. You either die as a noob or live long enough to get a title hacker.This is yet the best Counter-Strike game where casual and hardcore gamers can play. I recommend this.Rating 9/10

rytho	Not Recommended	1,038.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rytho/	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive used to be a great game, but constant bad updates and the toxic playerbase have ruined it. The competitive aspect used to seem like a good thing, but people take this game way too seriously and will lash out at you if you do anything even slightly wrong, and then on the other hand there are people who don't take it seriously enough and join competitive games just to annoy the people who take it seriously. There is no balance to this, you will hardly ever find a good team that you enjoy playing with.Maps - There may seem like a decent selection of maps to choose from, but there are only a select few which actually get played, and those are the old maps which most people have played thousands of times so it may be hard to get into, you may even feel discouraged.Not P2W - This game isn't pay to win, there are only weapon/glove skins which are purely cosmetic or different knives which ultimately all do the same thing, there has been a lot of controversy in the past about this kind of system being available to kids, there are cases where children steal their parents credit card just to buy skins.Many of the recent updates over the past year or so have been garbage, with many maps being added which almost never get played after a week, along with glove skins and other items so that valve can make money. I feel like this game has been abandoned by the developers, and now they primarily use it as another way to make easy money, completely disregarding the loyal playerbase and professional players.Smurfs (an experienced player using a new account to face lower ranks) and hackers are a pretty big problem in this game, and despite valves many failed attempts at combating the issue almost nothing has changed. Valves anti-cheat is garbage, and if you do end up getting this game, I would reccomend either faceit or ESEA, because their anti-cheat is a lot better and you generally face better players than if you were to play regular competitive.Although this game used to be a lot of fun to play competitively with friends, I can not reccomend it in it's current state, in my eyes this game is dying and after putting just over 1000 hours into it, I am ready to never play it again.Feel free to comment on anything you disagree with :)

󠀡jordan	Recommended	4,073.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jpg/	I don't want to judge the game that early, im gonna do a detailed review when i got some more playtime.
ThreuM	Not Recommended	5,029.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988347964/	The review you are about to read is alot of mixed feelings.. Notice i have 3k+ hours.. I have been playing Counter-Strike since 1.5 with some breaks in between focusing on school or relationships and while i have played plenty of other big titles growing up such as the Grand Theft Auto series or the Battlefield series i have always come back to the one game that i know and love. If you are really into shooters and have tried this game than you too will probably agree that CS has the most consistent replayability factor and is arguably the simplest yet most skillful shooter out there. Unlike games like Call Of Duty or Battlefield there is little to no debris covering your screen or random hiding spots that people camp behind at all times. Yes it happens but to be good in Counter-Strike Global Offensive you must capitalize on rushes and support your teammates in completing the objective. This is the ULTIMATE teamplay game and has just recently had an incredible boost in professional cs go tournaments concerning prize money and the viewers watching them. I stayed up all night til 7am to watch either Dreamhack or ESL (forget which one) That one match alone had about 300,000 viewers.. whereas CS Source was barely keeping their head above water with Professional tournys and teams in their day. So whats the problem?? The up until just recently awesome people over at Valve have become so focused on aqcuiring new players and revenue reguarding things like skins, cases, keys, taxes on items we sell on the marketplace, passes for new maps with objectives and even new copies of the game. Somewhere along the way i feel as if they have given up on the integrity of the game because it seems like every few months they put the game on sale for 5 bucks or so even though it is already insanely cheap only $15. I dont think you will find a single player in CS that will tell you they have played another game that is better or even EQUAL to CS and its replayability for $15.. That being said over time of course people will accuse other people of hacking i.e. wallhacking/aimbotting so if the game goes on sale for 4.99 even if a percentage of the people accusing others of hacking buy the game cheap just to have an alt account to get revenge and also hack thats a problem.. Now you think about Valve putting the game on sale a couple times a year and of course there will be MANY people that buy 5 or even more copies of the game! ..Just to hack and boost their friends.. This is becoming more of a problem for legit players like me. I literally feel like a superhero in a world full of villians. I am quickly seeing the decline of great real fun real skilled matches in CSGO. Everytime i join a competitive match there will from now on ALWAYS be a new account on the other team.. What is their excuse? "Oh im just smurfing.." You can even tell there are many more people hacking in overwatch these days. (overwatch is a self review cs go system of random people to determine if they were hacking or not) 6-12 months ago you would find overview cases kind of a challenge to decide on and most of the time would have some pretty nice skins. Nowadays 9/10 Overwatch cases they have absolutely no skins on their account or .20 cent skins to make it look like they do have skins and they couldnt POSSIBLY be hacking. Hackers do this because they KNOW there is a very high chance of them getting banned and losing these skins forever. Valve states that anyone Vac-Banned will NOT be able to get it overturned for any reason whatsoever. So tell me why during one of the major CS GO tournaments that just passed Pasha from the pro team Virtus Pro he was being filmed in real life over his shoulder and got vac banned in the middle of his match. simply said no i am not hacking and got his account UNBANNED. If he was at a lan tourny with everyone watching then he couldnt have been hacking right?? Wrong. It is going around that there is an undectable and unseen hack that is built into the map from the workshop(not exactly certain on the details) even when you are watching his screen in real life you would not notice.. Even worse than that every time valve does a wave of vac bans which is not nearly often enough there comes another undetectable hack that people find almost right away. The major point i am trying to make on this subject is that Valve makes MILLIONS on us for each skin, key, case, tax on the items we sell in game, operation pass and copy of the game we buy. and they still have a mediocre anti cheat system.. thats like the NFL making billions of dollars and letting anyone onto the field during the game because as long as they have a football jersey on they wont get caught. If you ask me they are stealing our money and are completely content with people buying 1,2,3, 10 new copies of the game with their excuse being "smurfing" (smurfing is when you log into a diff account with a much lower rank and completely destroy the other team to have ...fun?) It's pathetic and lowers Counter-Strike dramatically in my eyes as the greatest competitive game ever on PC. We must not forget it did pave the way for games like COD. Valve needs to stop being content with the $$$$ they are raking in and take back the integrity of the game. If that means hiring a whole new department to look into this and take serious action then so be it but for now if a friend just got a pc and asked what game he should download i would NOT recommend Counter-Strike.. Again i have been playing for about a decade and i myself come close to stopping playing all together sometimes sadly i am so attached to CS its not something i can easily do. Valve knows this and Valve is taking advantage of us. END OF STORY.

✪ Jaf	Recommended	3,868.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JaffaParty/	Lets ignore the aggressive silvers and *cough* Russians *cough* and focus on some positive aspects:Gameplay 9/10The gameplay itself is on par with perfection, with customization options such as crosshair (shape, size, color ect), left or right handed play and of course the beautiful console interface which makes everything just THAT more simple. Very good :) Pixel-walkers will be shot.Graphics 8/10The graphics are very good, utilizing the source engine to it's full potential. Awesome maps, awesome scenery. Even skins that you can literally sell your soul for to make your play-style feel a little more... Classy. It better be worth it though because you're probably now homeless, because that FN Dragon Lore you just bought cost you a re-mortgage of your luxury condo.Sound and voice acting 10/10Beautiful sound, even back in Counter-Strike: Source, Valve has used awesome audio design, with a good quality pair of headphones, you can hear every step around you, so take advantage of it! The ability to sound ♥♥♥♥♥ is amazing when you're 1v5 clutching and you hear 3 guys to your right and 2 to your left, but can determine their distance based on sound alone, amazing. They have done it right. The original CS:S voices such as the "Terrorists Win" and "Counter-Terrorists Win" are still used in CS:GO today! Recently CSGO was updated with a new Audio Codec, making those Angry russians screaming "♥♥♥♥♥♥BLYET" just that little bit extra crisper and tasty. Good job Valve!Game physics 8/10Coming from the HL2 Engine, the physics in CSGO are on par! To the weapon recoil, to the boost spots, to the nade stacking skills to the casual birds flying in the sky. A few issues with pixel walking especially in the professional scene (DAMN YOU FNATIC) but I think most have been sorted and patched out :)Community 6/10Okay, so here is where i have my biggest issues. Yeah it's not the best community, but it usually depends on your rank, In Silver/Nova you're more likely to encounter toxic players who leave/troll and harrass so much that you want to literally uppercut your monitor but as you get better (and more tolerant of said individuals) and see your rank increase, you'll realize that Valve has a large hacker/cheater/smurf issue. Gaben is taking care of them in waves, but you know, how big can the waves get before you cause a Tsunami... you get me? No? Okay.. well... I'm sure they're doing something about it... sure.Overall experience: 8/10 (Amended: I found the community somewhat lacks, yet there are some awesome YouTubers that you should check out if you're interested in exploring the GOOD side of the CS:GO community. Trilluxe and Sparkles to name a couple.)It has some problems, but I'm still enjoying this game. Everyone should at least try CSGO! Updated regularly, bug fixes and such, regular tournaments, LAN events ect! New maps every other month, new skins every other WHENEVER, brilliant. Highly recommend you play this game, despite the abundance of cheaters and pro-level players getting involved with cheating, you should play this game. DON'T CHEAT THOUGH! GLHFThanks for Reading!\m/

Beauman	Recommended	1,395.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/beaubeau/	CS: GO makes my ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tingle with pain. When I get a headshot I wince with a burning sensation in my testicles. I realized this game is not healthy to play, one reason being I recently installed a rop hanging from my ceiling just incase i get demoted to silver elite. My mom does not approve. Everytime I get killed I cut a little slit in my arm to hopefully teach me not to die. It has not been working and I have gone into a deep depression. I do not recemmend purchasing this game that infects you with a spite to kill yourself and other, and that creates a void that only gets filled from winning matches and getting promoted. But makes an even bigger void when you get demoted and lose. Please dont buy this game if you want a happy life free of suicidal thoughts.
ThunderWolf550	Recommended	1,328.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThunderWolf550/	Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a tactical competitive first person shooter.  Aspect Review   Gameplay The competitive game mode is the main grasp of the game for me. It features close to endless enjoyment and always offers a different experience each time. The game is heavily skill based, and will require some time and effort to get better. There is plenty of guns, all with different recoil patterns. There are many maps in the game, and new ones are added during operations. There are also community maps you can play with friends as well. The other gamemodes to competitive are more casual gamemodes, but are usually not as enjoyable, due to the lack of skill groups meaning you will end up against better or worse opponents to yourself.   Graphics and Optimisation Graphics are not the main aim of CS:GO. They are nothing special, but are definately improved over previous games. The game is decently optimised, and can run on many machines, even old ones!   Additional Content The game has microtransactions in the form of weapon skins. They offer no in-game advantage and simply change the appearance of the weapon. They can be bought in the form of cases and keys, bought off the market individually or earned by playing the game as drops. You can sell the weapons and cases you earn from playing the game on the market, equip them for yourself or trade with other players.   Value This game is probably my most played game on Steam. I bought the game on sale for £2.50, but to be honest it's worth the full £12. If you do end up getting it on sale, you could probably earn the money back from weapon skins, or even profit. Of course, this is even possible when buying the game for the full price, but less likely.   Aspect Score (/10)   Gameplay 10   Graphics & Optimisation 6   Additional Content 10   Value 10   Pay to win? No   OVERALL 10 Notes: I rate this game to be the best FPS game I have ever played!!! I don't rate any other game on Steam I have higher, I recommend this for literally anyone!

private ryan	Not Recommended	195.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/borntolosedotjpeg/	They say that it’s easier to tear someone down than it is to build someone up. It’s true. It’s ♥♥♥♥ing true how no one does anything about it. They go with it and call you ‘a ♥♥♥♥♥♥’ or ‘♥♥♥♥ing garbage’ and so on. No one cares about the kid who just sits there doing nothing wrong and gets called that. No one cares about the one who isn’t as good as the rest, and sits in spawn while his team constantly calls him gay and a♥♥♥♥♥♥head and constantly pointing every single thing that he’s done wrong. No one bothers to give lending advice or compliment what good he’s done. They just tear down the foundation of him. They don’t bother mending to the walls of the household; they’d rather fire the cannons at it. They would rather choke you with aspersion than give just one compliment. The world would much rather lead the child to end of his short life, and throw away all his progress and the [wonderful] things he would accomplish later on in life. The world is sick, to me. I just wish people would cast aside the brute’s club, and wield the carpenter’s hammer. The game itself is good, however, the community sucks.

Deak Sauce	Not Recommended	429.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeakSauce/	The Game is more worried about making $$$ and making skins which in turn = more $$$. Then getting rid of the cheaters and people that exploit the game. The only thing that was remotely fun about the game was the skin trading. You could get some skins then trade them up and sometimes get a skin worth enough $$$ to sell on the steam market to buy a new game. But now if you start with a 2-3$ skin and you want to trade your way up to a knife or another skin it will take years only being able to trade a skin every 7 days. RIP any fun left in this game

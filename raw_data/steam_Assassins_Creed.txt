✪ Isaiah's In HD	Recommended	30.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IsaiahsInHD/	Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥this game is awesome, the combat is wayyy more fun than Origins and the naval exploration is just the icing on the cake. This is a great follow-up to an Origins, it improves on virtually every aspect. Even the protagonists are quite likeable, mostly Kassandra tbh. The Spear of Leonidas is badass and makes for some really cool looking stealth takedowns. I mean, idk what else to say about this game, i'm like 15 hrs in and i've barely scratched the surface. This is a definite reccomendation for me, if you liked Origins, then you'll love this one

starcrescendo	Not Recommended	14.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/starcrescendo/	Sorry but its way too difficult and broken right now. They need to let us disable the level scaling at the most basic, and turning off the "mercenary" system at best.The game expects you to kill enemies to complete the story, as you kill enemies there is a "wanted level" mechanic. Problem is these "mercenaries" hunt you down and are often overleveled and very strong and spawn in where you are trying to do missions. It is the most frustrating thing ever redoing a mission over and over because the mercenary spawns there and won't leave. I am giving up on the which is disappointing but I am stuck unable to level because there are mercenaries all over, and I don't have the money to pay them off, but yet they won't let me do quests.Right now there is a woman with a poison spear and a lion following her around and she can turn red and instantly kill you. Its broken unbalanced and unfair and ruined the experience of this game for me.
AbstractRobbie	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/abstractrobbie/	Tut tut... I think I have hit the world record for the shortest time a game has been run and installed on my computer. 1 hour downloading, never even bothered to get past the initial scene killing many soliders. Cut scenes are choppy just like the last title by the way and the game is badly optimised which is becoming a commonality with Ubisoft games recently. I used to use Ubisoft as the example of how to make and release titles in reviews to poor releases years ago. What happened??? Anyway I am not paying to send you bug reports and wait for you to fix simple issues whcih exist it seems in so many of your recent titles, and always the same issues. My rig is bursting with memory and GPU/CPU that isn't anywhere near utilized by most Ubisoft titles and yet still they play like a bag of S%%T.... I will NOT purchase a Ubisoft title again and I have already refunded this one.
Oberman	Not Recommended	27.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971715140/	An enthralling story and historical setting with horrid writing and dialouge. I love the RPG aspect but hate the Ubisoft washing of history like it's the "be-all-end-all". Taking the non-historical phallacies Ubisoft presents, it is a very fun and addicting game, I do not regret buying this one. I do however implore people to not buy any thing from the ubisoft store PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT.

I like the fact that it is more or less following in the format that the witcher 3 was, how could you not? purists will say its not an AC game for this fact, but to me the new way they have taken the series is far better and feels more grandios as it should for places steeped in mythologies like egypt and greece. to each his own but i love the new style.

Metzir	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009949535/	With about 30 hours of play time, and I've bearly put a dent into the map of the game. This will surely keep me entertained for a long time. While I have a pretty decent laptop I'm running, it is going on 3 years old, i can still run on a customized high settings and get a good 30 fps, but have chosen to run a cutomized medium to get about 45 to 60 fps and it doesnt look much different. The game play is similar to that of origin. While the story has got me hooked, i personally feel like I'm playing a skyrim modded with assassins creed gamestyle. In other words, other then the animus that the backstory of "Long ago" civilization. There has been nothing to do with templars and assassins. Almost as if Ubisoft wants to create a new title, but is afraid to leave the Assassin's Creed title line.I would highly recommend this game to anyone who has played previous from this line, and those who some how have never touched an Assassin's Creed game(you wont be lost other then the 2 mins of Leyla's story so far).

Enstage	Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/enstage/	Playing 4K @ 60Hz with an i7 8700k, ASUS GTX 1080Ti, average FPS of 48Hz on full ultra. I have been playing on nightmare difficulty, with exploration mode enabled.While I’m only a few hours into this game, there are definitely a number of things I can say about it. Firstly, this is not an “Assassin’s Creed” game, similar to how Origins wasn’t, but this time even it’s more detached in my opinion. I don’t necessarily see this to be a bad thing, the old mould was getting tiresome, and this detachment allows for drastically different stories to be accommodated for.To start the game you are asked to choose a number of things; difficulty, exploration mode, and who you’re going to play as. The latter is definitely interesting…you cannot change your choice once made, so I spent some time making this relatively simple and binary decision. At first I went with Kassandra, but something didn’t feel right playing as her, the voice acting didn’t match what I expected, among other issues I had. After a short time playing as Kassandra I completely deleted my save, went through the prologue again and switched to Alexios, I’m enjoying him much more.Graphically, the game simply looks stunning, the first thing I did was climb to a high place and just observe. I seriously can’t wait to explore the rest of what this map has to offer (which by the way is considerably larger than that of Egypt, and consisting of a lot of water…)Completely unable to comment on the story thus far, but it was definitely a welcome sight seeing more RPG elements making it into this installation.I will update this as I progress.
Lee	Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecandyman/	Not very far into it yet, but what I can say is the intro storyline is can be very cringy at times. I mean that a lot of the characters and cutscenes so far are full of cringe. Seriously, why do this? Also, ultra graphical settings look nothing like the trailers unfortunately. Feels console-ish. Still looks good, but the trailers present a different look entirely.That being said, I will continue to play it.

Buurt	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017188551/	First of all : the game runs very smooth ive got a 1070 and a I7-3770 so an kinda old CPUbut it runs on very high to Ultra with 60 fps.for all Black flag fanboys, this game has the ship gameplay in it again and its the same funas in black flag but looks better and feels a littel bit smoother.Gameplay : it feels smoother than origins and funnier its kinda the same system but just a little bit better.The RPG system is way higher than in Origins, you can choose what you say or choose what you do, you choices even have consequences. Armor system is more RPG than before too.Map is very big but it doesent feel empty or anythink.many quest and cool quests.You even have a system in the game like the blacklist from NFS Most Wanted.i play with controller so dont know about Keyboard but with controller it plays good.Story is very very good, better than the last few assassins creed.For me this game is a 9/10 no bugs or crashes so far. It feels and is better than Origins to me.so if you like Origins and black flag and good ARPG i would recommend it.

Bob Saget	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198367592410/	Now i havent played much but i have played enough to say this, in short this game is an amazing game with its flaws but I highly recomend buying it, and if you want more on that keep reading my novel. First flaw is that this game is basicly a mash between AC and The Witcher, which i mean you cant really blame them for trying to copy them since TW3 has been title best RPG so give them some slack with that, and im not saying its a bad copy of it, it just could use some improving in some areas, like for example bring back the old icon that tells you if you are spotted or hidden, thats just a personal preffernce. Another thing that could be improved on but wont because its a main part of the game allready is the basic combat system, its litterally just a clicking game, thats a part of The Witcher that they should have copied is the timing in your clicks, it just engages you more and is a better experiance. It isnt like the traditional AC game as im sure you allready know, but it is pretty different, not a bad differnt for the most part, just different. Most aspects in this game look great but feel rushed,  the AI in this game was based off the metaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ folk because if you shoot an enemy in the face it can take a few seconds for him to realize hes been shot, that and once he has been shot he will slugishly wonder up to you and kind a just push you intill hes built up enought courage to swing at you. other stuff is jsut things like terrain improvements, your horse will sometimes when going along a hilly area just vere to a path that it cant accuallly go up then it will just stand verticaly on a wall whilst it realized its mistake. That and some parts of the game can be made easier buy paying real money and to me that counts as pay to win, also they made it so you can buy skins for yourself and honnestly that feels like just a waste but if you want to throw money into it fine by me. Now that was just some of the bad, and im sure i left alot out but on to the good.This game is amazing as i have allready stated, graphicly its a masterpiece, optimization was done pretty well for what i have seen and the feel of almost everything else that wasnt mentioned up there is great. Keep in mind im playing on mostly the highest settings. The Bird was well done it really is fun to fly around like that and spot people and objects and when playing the way where you dont have all the areas unlocked yet, you use him alot and its nice to see that he is usefull and nice to use and not something you dread haveing to use everytime. Charachter models are amazing as well, for some reason and its probally that there is no depth in the voices (it feels like they are talking from 3 inches from your face and the direction of the camera angle dosent change how you hear the dialog in a cut scene or interaction) it just dosent seem natural in some part but only in some areas not all the time rember that, the lip movement is pretty on point and facial expressions are done very very well. shadows (with no RTX) are quite nice to look at to, they are done accuratly and dont look like they are artifical, they for the most part look quite real. textures in this game are amazinf from under water, to a boat, to just walking around town, the detail put into it is astonishing, the carpets look like they are woven, the walls look rough, the ground looks like its been trampled by horses and humans, the water surface could use some work mostly the ripples (like when youre swimming, there are no ripples going from your side out, but thats minor details and can be easily overlooked), but other wise the water is great, under water is done with the same attention to detail as most parts on land. The missions so far are quite fun to do and each has been unique, i have  killed a shark for people, stole a mans eye, made someone give me his money...well he owed it to me, surched a sunken ship, assassinated a whole compound of people, killed a bounty hunter, climed zues' genitals (yes you can do it, and hes tiny), killed alot of people,  and much more content because im only on  like 1/4 of the whole map and im still no where near finninshing this 1/4 part of it, and all of it has been made with care and the dedication of bringing the best player experiance that they can bring to you.well that was my ramble and belive me i could have gone on for alot more but i figured id spare those few who have read to this part some of your time, but if you are reading this i say to you, if you want a great game with alot of content, good content, and you like RPG, or ancient greek/roman mythology, or good games, get this one, i dought you will regret it AND IF YOU DO you get to experiance some much of this great game in so little time that you will know if you like it or not before the 6 hours are up for a refund, in this game which is accually really cool, Time slows when haveing fun, i feel like i have played 10+ hours in this game and have enjoyed every one of them.
OhHelloThere	Recommended	22.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhunterfi/	Pros:The game is very good. The map is huge, the progression is interesting and you can choose between different abilities. If you mess up or want to try another arsenal of abilities, you can reset them with a small amount of in-game money.The naval combat is excellent. Boarding, ramming, shooting flaming arrows... Just 10/10.The combat is immersive. It's easy to pick up but hard to master. I love the finishing animations. Now you can block hits from your enemies. Timing it correctly also stuns the enemy for a brief moment, giving you time to attack.There's a huge amount of different armor/clothing items and weapons.The game allows you to hunt. The hunting is somewhat one-dimentional but it's a reliable source of money and trading goods (which you can sell, you can't do anything else with them).The characters are good, but the voice acting is bad for some characters. This doesn't bother me, however, so i'm fine with it.Cons: The game is poorly optimized. I have a high end PC so i get around 90-110fps on ultra at 1080p, but i know that people with lower specs get very poor performance.Hunting could have some improvements done to it.Nothing else, i completely recommend this game to everyone.
DragonSlayer848	Recommended	23.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DragonSlayer848/	For the total of 15+ hours I played I can say that I love the game. If you played Assassin's Creed Origins and like that game then you will like this one. It is esentually the same mechanics as Origins execpt some of the fighting bugs have been fixed and the game is overall better as though the mechanics have been fine tuned from last game Origins. In Odyssey you start off being able to assassinate (which you could not do in the beginning of Origins) and also it seems like combat is smoother and easier. I won't say that the game is perfect, there are a lot of things that I would have put into the game if I had created the content for the game developers to craft. But even with those small things that bug me, the game is great and will continue to occupy my attention until Fallout 76 arives. In any case, going back, if you want to know if you will like this game, the best way to know would be to play AC Origins and see if that new look on Assassin's Creed intrests you. If you have never played any of the AC games before I would urge you to play them, they are great and the best will always be AC Black Flag, to me anyways.

DeathStalker	Recommended	40.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathStalker131/	i bought this game with low expecations and i was pleasantly surprised! All i am gonna say for this Review is that this is The Best Assassin's Creed game yet, sure they might have removed the hidden blade and there is no longer "real assassins" in the game.. But that honestly doesn't bother me, especially considering how good this game actually is. If you are looking for a Good RPG game then buy this.
Coopy	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoopytheSlavik/	A wonderful and enjoyable experience mixed with a much needed revision to Assassins Creed. Change is needed in video games, much like cars and everything else. Throughout the years games cannot stay the same. This was a beautiful way to go, and I enjoy the new RPG aspect of it, just like Origins. Although I must say the performance is indeed as awful as they say. I'm gunna have to blame the DRM for this considering I have an i7-8700 cpu, and the fact that only Ubisofts DRM games run with 100% cpu power, clogging my machine running it, regardless, fun and entertaining game though.

The Bird was well done it really is fun to fly around like that and spot people and objects and when playing the way where you dont have all the areas unlocked yet, you use him alot and its nice to see that he is usefull and nice to use and not something you dread haveing to use everytime. Charachter models are amazing as well, for some reason and its probally that there is no depth in the voices (it feels like they are talking from 3 inches from your face and the direction of the camera angle dosent change how you hear the dialog in a cut scene or interaction) it just dosent seem natural in some part but only in some areas not all the time rember that, the lip movement is pretty on point and facial expressions are done very very well. shadows (with no RTX) are quite nice to look at to, they are done accuratly and dont look like they are artifical, they for the most part look quite real. textures in this game are amazinf from under water, to a boat, to just walking around town, the detail put into it is astonishing, the carpets look like they are woven, the walls look rough, the ground looks like its been trampled by horses and humans, the water surface could use some work mostly the ripples (like when youre swimming, there are no ripples going from your side out, but thats minor details and can be easily overlooked), but other wise the water is great, under water is done with the same attention to detail as most parts on land. The missions so far are quite fun to do and each has been unique, i have  killed a shark for people, stole a mans eye, made someone give me his money...well he owed it to me, surched a sunken ship, assassinated a whole compound of people, killed a bounty hunter, climed zues' genitals (yes you can do it, and hes tiny), killed alot of people,  and much more content because im only on  like 1/4 of the whole map and im still no where near finninshing this 1/4 part of it, and all of it has been made with care and the dedication of bringing the best player experiance that they can bring to you.well that was my ramble and belive me i could have gone on for alot more but i figured id spare those few who have read to this part some of your time, but if you are reading this i say to you, if you want a great game with alot of content, good content, and you like RPG, or ancient greek/roman mythology, or good games, get this one, i dought you will regret it AND IF YOU DO you get to experiance some much of this great game in so little time that you will know if you like it or not before the 6 hours are up for a refund, in this game which is accually really cool, Time slows when haveing fun, i feel like i have played 10+ hours in this game and have enjoyed every one of them.
OhHelloThere	Recommended	22.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowhunterfi/	Pros:The game is very good. The map is huge, the progression is interesting and you can choose between different abilities. If you mess up or want to try another arsenal of abilities, you can reset them with a small amount of in-game money.The naval combat is excellent. Boarding, ramming, shooting flaming arrows... Just 10/10.The combat is immersive. It's easy to pick up but hard to master. I love the finishing animations. Now you can block hits from your enemies. Timing it correctly also stuns the enemy for a brief moment, giving you time to attack.There's a huge amount of different armor/clothing items and weapons.The game allows you to hunt. The hunting is somewhat one-dimentional but it's a reliable source of money and trading goods (which you can sell, you can't do anything else with them).The characters are good, but the voice acting is bad for some characters. This doesn't bother me, however, so i'm fine with it.Cons: The game is poorly optimized. I have a high end PC so i get around 90-110fps on ultra at 1080p, but i know that people with lower specs get very poor performance.Hunting could have some improvements done to it.Nothing else, i completely recommend this game to everyone.
race533	Recommended	5.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058987312/	So far fantastic...best open world I have seen...and I have seen a few. The quests are fun, interesting..the cut scenes are all masterpiece.
Throbbing shaft of the forbidden	Not Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cole62195/	game is ♥♥♥♥ing tedious in melee combat on normal, it was perfect in origins, how they managed to ruin it makes no sense. either dont play it, or play it on easy.
JayNiner	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039620145/	If you like The Witcher 3...this game is for you. It's great to see that other Devs are learning from The Witcher on how to make an amazing game. I would definitely say that this will be in the running for greatest or Top 5 RPG's of all time. Great story so far, with Assassin's creed base, impressive.
Coyote-6	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059312730/	Ubisoft's dumpster fire of a release; classic.

Veteran Sergeant Servius	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004949187/	Returning this game, it's a buggy mess.  I've played 86 minutes.  In that time I encountered some geolocation file problem wtih uPlay.  Fixing that took over an hour.  Then I made it to the cave with the "gods", snuck in behind the statue there, died, and encountered the bug where you can't load a save (all you see is a black screen with the music playing in the background, but the game never loads your save).  Gave up, went out, came back, tried to start it back up, and encountered another uPlay bug saying it was a bad time to activate the game right now, please come back later.  That happened when I tried to start the game with the desktop icon.  When I go into my steam library and click Play, it worked.  But the load bug is still there, so when I died, trapped in a Black SOD again.

Its as if black flag and origins had a kid but had a decent story to tell.  The world is massive and quests come on organically.  I've had no issues with freezing or crashing and those who are complaining about microtransacitons I honestly don't understand.  Yes, there are microstransactions and that sucks but they're in no way intrusive and you have to go to a specific page to even find them.  The entire game can be enjoyed greatly without even looking at that page.  I definitely call this one a BUY.

Pugzilla	Recommended	9.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ichii3d/	I havn't played an Assassins game in a long time, which probably makes this game feel much more fresh to me than other people. Honestly, I'm really enjoying it. I would say the starting is a little rough, but within the first hour I was drawn into the world and enjoying the game loops. Its a big must to play the game on Exploration Mode, not being told exactly where everything is hidden makes it all the more rewarding finding objective locations and gives meaning to using your bird and syncronizing locations, it enhances the core loop of world exploration also. I would highly recommend.

JimBeamJr	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JimBeamJr/	Hey Ubi, so, i have to wipe my whole computer, buy a new motherboard with Ram, a new processor, a new cooling system, and a new hard drive, just to play your game, because you wanted to include AVX, which makes it so people who rely on older reliable computers, who bought YOUR game, need to upgrade just to play it, and you wont even accomodate us with a patch.you may think i dont need to buy all that, but all those parts are old and incompatible with eachother, if i buy a new motherboard ill need ddr5 ram because i'm using ddr3 on my current, which as far as i'm aware is out of date, i also need a compatible cooling system for said motherboard that won't fry it, and the motherboard is because my old motherboard wouldn't support a new processor, and if i'm upgrading it all i might aswell add more space cuz god knows these games are too damn big now. i must say the only savior in this was the customer service guy who gave me the info i needed, said sorry that he couldn't help, understands where i'm coming from, and wished me a good day, god bless him.All this for AVX, thanks UbiEAsoft.

You do not need them, therefore if you do not buy them, the problem is solved. The micro trannys are okay imo because you do not need them to succeed or get through the game. There is no pay wall for advancing. With that said, the game is great. I really like the story of this one, it truly feels like an Odyssey.

Captain DOTS	Not Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dotsFU/	This was my first entry into the AC Franchise, and I gotta say, the gameplay is fun. However, I am completely and totally incensed that I spent $120 on a game that crashes or freezes up (I cant force close it with Task Manager either) anywhere from getting past the loading screen to randomly and without warning crashing 20 minutes into gameplay. My system more than meets the recommended hardware specifications, and there is no hardware reason for these failures.Ubisoft, you are a AAA studio and quite frankly, I expect your products to be fully finished at launch. I am tired of trying to make this product work. Give me my money back.

(♥♥♥♥ the light guys who parry every attack). I don't need some over the top green gas to tell me i've poisoned a man instead you should do something subtle like in the old games. Also holy ♥♥♥♥ are the physics terrible in this game all the falling feels like its in slow motion (drop a body off a cliff you will see what I mean) and the dodges look terrible they look soooo cartoony and unrealistic like your contorting your self in order to get away.

There is also a problem with the clibing as I frequently press shift to run, cause of fps games, and sometimes the person goes and climbs things which are not in ur line of sight.

I don't know if this is a problem, but, it runs at 30fps top with a 1070 and a i5 6600 at 1080p, the reason I find that maybe this is not a problem, is because I'm playing this at 4k 30fps. That makes it weird, because I'm having the same performance at two very diferent resolutions (?). Ain't complaining, tho.

juggernog777	Recommended	25.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073522020/	The game looks great! A very good immersion. One bad is the grinding for levels, but generally a good experience!Playing on a Inspiron 7577, 7700HQ, GTX 1060, 16GB RAM, single channel, 256 NVMe SSD. Everything ultra high, but volumetric clouds (+45% perf if you put on medium) and fog to medium (same quality as high basically for +4% performance). Getting around 40-50fps.
Thetombomb	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetombomb/	There is always something to do in this game and you can do it in whatever order you want to. It does not feel repetitive like some of the previous games. In addition to the numerious ways to approach the game, the game world is huge. The game is gorgeous. The plot is good and the game actually has some substance behind it's theme and gameplay. I think this is mainly because Assassin's Creed is finally to the point in history where there is some recorded history to utilize as guidance. The substance relies less on the developers' creativity and takes several cues from history itself. This make the game more exciting.

Jarnbjorn	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021162063/	Haven't played an AC game since AC 3, this time period sings to me. Easily one of my favorite periods in history and it delivers well. The controls for PC can take time gettting used to like climbing, and using abilities but all in all great game. Somewhat repetitive so 8/10.Gorgeous scenery, using a spear makes you feel like the spartan you are.

Sgt. MG	Recommended	29.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962426646/	Going to keep this review short for now, as I have only completed the first Odyssey Chapter on Alexios and there is much much more game to go through.Immersion is good.Graphics are good.Gameplay is intuitive.Story is deep and I like how your choices in dialogue or actions effect how your story plays out.You like a style of armor that you got in the beginning but don't want to lose out on armor defense points? Well, just like it's predecessor (Origins) the upgrading of a equipment is a major pull through for AC games.Naval Combat is fun.  Nothing like watching your boat going full ram speed into another ship and watch it sink.I saw some negative reviews that stated they could not play but they have the same spec in hardware that I have for CPU and video card.  However, I have experienced a minor issue that has not repeated itself so far.On my first desychronization death, the loading splash screen did not appear but the loading background music was playing and I could heard the loading sound prompts going off.  I couldn't do anything except close the program and restart.I will update my review when I get through more of the game.Edit: I have an i5-4690k CPU @3.50GHz and GeForce GTX 960

SladeWolf	Recommended	34.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109051066/	An amazingly beautiful experience visually, audiotorily, and emotionally. I did not expect to be greeted with such a great game. The few aspects which I did not like in Black Flag were addressed and fixed. There is more to the world than water. But there is still the naval aspect of the game. The game lets you choose what you want to do, when you want to do it. The storytelling is amazing, minus a few tids and bits that stand out. Whatever issues I found were minimal to the sheer scope of magnificence in this game.
Chapter Ancient Marius of Ultam	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263409297/	good game so far, other than the fact that my graphics cards is a 650 and the min is a 660 so now after a few months of saving for the game i get to save for a few more month for a 660 to play the game without bluescreening my PC. However i highly reccomend giving the game a go if youre a fan of assasins creed. i have poured hours into the game despit bluescreening my pc several times and assoon as i have the money for a 660 and have it installed i will become a assasins creed hermit!

Operator Sandwich	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/arbitres/	Story telling is less involving and interesting compared to Origins, but mechanically this is a far better game.Mercenaries mechanic is great, feels like Shadow of Mordor kind of thing a never ending cycle of tough enemies that hunt you down and drop great loot.War where you help one of two sides to switch back and forth territories with finally massive battles.Generated quests to get xp and money going if you run short.World is huge, it feels larger than Origins, but maybe because there were some locations with barely any points of interest. Now we hunt down cultists who are many, spread around the world and you need clues to find them and kill them.Ship is kind of the same, with more different expensive upgrades and yet ship battles too return decent loot sometimes.All in all resources are more than manageable I have tons of resources and cash and basically break down all weapon I don't need.On my PC i5 3470, ddr3 8gb, 1060gtx 6gb it runs around 35-57 on max settings in 1080p. Lowest I had was 28 fps in some really heavy scene. Runs even better than Origins.A great game to my surprise.

I have never played an Assassin's Creed game before now, and it gives the series a good first impression on me. I'm running it with a very old and not so good laptop, so I lagg sometimes, but that is to be expected with this big of a game. I'm just surprised I'm able to run it at all tbh.Also... I don't get why a lot of people are saying this game is "Pay to Win". Like who are you paying to "win" against? I understand pay to advance quicker, or to save time, since there is a gridning system. But there is no "winning" in a non competitive game..
Martin	Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/regi123/	Love it so far. Very happy with the direction UBI are taking the franchise.Performance is pretty bad if you're trying to run on Very High/Ultra High. To be honest there really is no need. With some tweaking and a mixture of Medium/High/Very High (Volumetric clouds on medium) I get 55-90fps (55 being the minimum) at 3440x1440 (100hz G-Sync) with a 1080ti. It looks stunning.Certain settings such as Character Detail and Environment Detail and even AO and AA (at higher resolutions) have very little visual different from Very High - Ultra High or High - Very High but have a significant performance hit... especially to your minimum FPS. Volumetric clouds also have a major impact on FPS. Dropping clouds to Medium, Character and Environment to Very High and Shadows to High took my minimum FPS from sub 30 to 55, increased my maximum a little and my average was 70ish FPS. Comparing Screenshots at these settings to all out Ultra showed very little difference. Certainly not enough to worry about.

Ann Takamaki	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vayne778/	Assassin's Creed evolving to Action RPG. And that's a great thing.I love it that you can pick male and female character here.... Kassandra is Perfect :)This game has better Skill sets than AC Origins, so many cool abilties that you want to unlock ASAP.And yeah...the RPG element is great as well, I love the new direction of Assassin's Creed franchise now.CAN'T WAIT FOR Assassin's Creed IN JAPAN!!!!
Scoobert	Not Recommended	52.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Scoobert1/	The series has clearly lost it's identity... Origins was a step in the right direction but turining AC into a complete RPG is not the right thing to do.
Resurgam ex Styx	Not Recommended	0.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017526338/	Can't play because apparently the game requires a CPU with AVX. Ubisoft never mentioned this in its system requirements for this game. Moreover, from what I gather, AC Origins and The Crew 2 had the same issue, and it was later patched for both games with no impact on performance for CPUs without AVX. Mind-boggling why this kind of problem isn't sorted out before launch, especially for people who pay to access the game earlier.

Haywire Hayley	Recommended	24.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/haywirehayley/	20 hours in and I think it may be the best Assassin's Creed game in a while. I haven't been captivated by an AC game for almost an entire day without breaks since AC4. The world is beautiful and Kassandra is incredibly likeable.I never really find myself bored due to the size of the map and the amount of content packed within it. Story seems solid so far too. If you're a fan of AC in general then you'll adore this, and it might be different enough to bring in people who previously disliked the franchise as well due to the fresh combat system (that started in Origins) and new RPG mechanics.I also received 5000 XP for partaking in an orgy and that was much appreciated.

Very ambitious, super open world with tons and tons of things to do, while still being able to push out AAA graphics,sound,story and gameplay. This and witcher 3 is the perfect example of how gaming should head towards, no limitations, no half arz game,  this game perfects the AC foruma and makes it even better then all the previous games.PROS:-Most beautiful vibrant graphics i seen in an open world yet.-Amazing amount of content the game offers.-Perfected Land and Naval gameplay.-Gameplay-Combat-Story and locales-Depth-no compromisesCONS:-4K performance- GTX 1080 TI, 2080 TI, cant seem to play it ultra 4K 60 FPS constant. Anything below 4K is more then fine in the performance side. Once they patch up the performance issues in 4K, this game will be perfect.-Not for the casual- Game is more like an offline MMORPG then a action game, it takes many many hours to get started and start becoming a true assassin, build up is slow, yet super epic once you get there.For me its not a CON at all, but for the casuals, call of duty kids, stay away, this game is meant to take weeks/months to 100% everything.

jvstnp	Recommended	20.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jvstnp/	This game so far is Origins 2.0. Although this comment seems like a bad thing. It is not. It is an amazing thing. It takes all the great mechanics in Origins and expands upon it though new combat, crafting and RPG dialogue; all while maintaining the Assassin feel. The new exploration mode is a great way to incentivise exploration and the setting is perfect to do just that. Admittedly it feels less like a stealth intensive game; but the stealth mechanics are still available and the new combat makes up for the lack of stealth and then some. Performance is solid. I needed to adjust some settings but it runs pretty smoothly around 60-70 fps at max settings with the 1070. Will update review as I play more of the game.
sonicmyst	Recommended	52.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sonicmyst/	Early Review (22.6 hrs on record, 06 Oct 2018)This iteration of AC is amazing. Direction towards RPG is good, but still not in the level of Witcher 3, though the branching dialogue and gear and skill customization are very much welcome. Losing the shield in exchange for active parrying and dodging makes combat more alive than ever. Environment, as usual is captivating. Mercenaries are welcome improvement over the Phylakes system of Origins, but needs more tweaks.Performance is almost the same with Origins, dropping a bit below 30fps but still very playable.P.S.Dynamic weather system adds more beauty to this game. Looks even better if you experienced storm while at sea.Microtransactions are not required. You will only need it if you do not have enough time to play this huge game, or too impatient and want to uncover that region blocked by level wall.

dark-raven	Recommended	77.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dark-raven/	This is the best Assassin's Creed game yet and I have played them all. 45 hours in and loved every minute of it! If you love games like Shadow of the Tomb Raider, Skyrim, Witcher 3, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor then this is definitely the game for you!
Rhinala	Recommended	52.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198815853827/	One of the best games that i have ever played. in my opinion it is a highly recommended game.Assassins creed Odyssey feels like the love child of the witcher 3, elder scrolls and assassins creed. Haven't felt so immersed in a game in a long time, i find myself ignoring the main quest and do a lot of side quests for the fun of it, every quest have a back story, the bounty quest feels line skyrim's radiant quest made a lot better. the crafter quest are interesting and captivating.It is very easy to create a hybrid build that will suite the player's favorite gamestyle. the skills in the game doesn't work in a linear way, once a skill is unlocked it can be used immediately even if the player never invested any point in that tree. The combat is fast and fun, every weapon feel different and have a different impact and weight. I love the mercenary system, i found myself overwhelmed by bounty hunters so many times because kasandra went on a killing spree.
UMC	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198108045061/	If you're having issue with cursor flickering/resetting on main menu try manually turn on the Keyboard and Mouse in the ACO.ini file in C:\Users\.....\Documents\Assassin's Creed Origins.

Pete_Peter_Peterson	Recommended	39.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984153498/	So many reviews in the negative in regards to performance.I have a 1070 ASUS STRIX and an i7 5820k, I also run a HEAVY reshade from Origins on top of it and I run a smooth / locked 50 fps (I can't play without the reshade, I'm a total GFX wh*re).The game is nothing short of amazing, I thought Origins was great but this one takes the cake thus far, I don't even feel like I've got started, the scope and size of this world is insane. The combat is expanded on from Origins and is hella fresh, very visually pleasing and gratifying. Choice of Dialogue for hardcore oldschool RPG fans and the exploration game mode is 10/10, bringing back an old gem.To those moaning about performance, you're trying to run (to date) one of the most demanding / best looking AAA titles that's in a GIANT open world sandbox, making bad reviews when it's not actually the fault of the game but rather yours as  a consumer expecting your less than stellar rig to make magic happen. I stated my specs above, I do not have an enthusiast build and I run a heavy reshade, without the reshade I lock at 60 fps and never dip below fully maxed out.If you want to PC game, tweak your settings if your PC is trash, have a marginly decent PC or go and join the Console noobs and play 30fps.
Neuro	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198861461728/	So, having to put 10 hours into the game these are some of the pros and cons I am experiencing in a short review.-Pros-Graphically the game is stunning. I am not currently running the game in Ultra, but even with high settings the game world is absolutely gorgeous. The fog literaly moves with your body as you walk through a village burned to ash. The sunlight beaming through the trees is as if I am walking through Narnia itself. Sailing the seas is just as beautiful as it appears in Sea of Thieves. Waves crashing along the boat with the sound and song of each crew member is nothing short of feeling immersed.The World. The zones are big and full of wildlife and humanoids that both pose a threat or alliance. Additionally, each zone feels unique. There are some islands that feels as if I am scaling the mountains of Colorado while others make me feel I am walking through the fields of grain in Kansas. The zones feel fresh and even the characters feel unique with the different factions at war.The loot system. If you are a fan of gathering various items and like different appearances as you progress through the game, this is a must have. It feels as if you are gathering a new piece of gear every 5 minutes and have the choice to use the gear, or to upgrade your current set (most of the items are upgradeable; few exceptions).Exploration Mode. If you want AC to feel like a hardcore RPg and you want to really immerse yourself in the world, then this added feature is amazing. Exploration mode removes quest trackers and will not "hold your hand" to a quest. You must fully listen to what NPC's tell you to do and read quest descriptions to figure out where you need to be."Attributes" and skills. They are not called attributes but your character will have 3 unique "damage dealers;" Hunter, Warrior and Assassin. Hunter being your bow damage/ranged, warrior being up close combat and assassin being damage dealt with assassinations and knockouts (the number it represents does not mean you will do that damage. I am unsure of the calculator at this time). Additionally, you have skills that you may mix and match to fit your play style. From healing, to bull rushes to ripping shields from your enemies, you pick the skills available to match your preferred playstyle (there is a con to this as well. See below). Story and Lore. So, there is a con here as well (see below).  However, if you are a fan of Spartan lore, you will absolutely love this one. Although, there are the typical fictionous character that Assassins Creed has offered, there are still many unique characters whose name may be familiar to you.-Cons-Combat. This is a big one. The combat feels better than Origins. Bosses are more difficult, they all can adapt to your weaknesses and strengths. However, I feel there are many times I am using the same technique: dodge, slow mo attack, dodge, slow mo attack, etc.. The combat feels fluid and great but I don't feel a lot of variety, even with the bonus skills. In fact, I almost feel some of the skills make the combat easier (bull rush for massive damage or heal every 25% loss back to full).Microtransactions. Oh yes, they are in here. Grant it, I never buy them and will never support them. They don't actually advertise them, or throw them in your face, but they are there so it still gets a negative down (please note, this con will not be applied to the overall score of this game. It is something you can buy but I don't see it giving a "leg up" as it is a SP RPG; it is just annoying they are there).Story (con). Although the story is good and involves vengeance and mystery, some of it feels rushed. For example, many Assassins Creed will focus on a central theme throughout the whole game (what is the apple, did Connor get vengeance, etc.), but this game seems to take turns here and there. What you thought may be the central theme/who the main antagonist may be will quickly change within an hour's time. Additionally, some big questions that kept you intrigued will be answered rather quickly. However, I am still rather early in the story arc but it is something I have noticed from the beginning parts of the main story.Rating this game today I would list it as a easy 8-9 category. I have experience 0 bugs and am enjoying my time with the main story arc and the side quests are just as enjoyable (perhaps even more enjoyable)!
CrzyProF	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrzyProF/	This game has an exceptional story by far and yes, it is difficult to level up and will force you to take part in the side quests. I am not a fan of "TIME SAVERS"(ffs)  IF YA WANT TO SAVE TIME DONT PLAY THE GAME  I would have been let down if the side quests were garbage, but they really are not. It can easily go past 50hrs of gameplay.PS.The game is very hardware dependant so scaling down resolution helps.

Dcentrics	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dcentrics/	Good game even if you do need a monster pc to run it decently at 1440p, I have an i7 6850k with a 1080ti and i sit stable around 80 to 90 frames per second. I see some reviews complaining that the game requires the AVX instruction set and that it wont even run on first generation i7s. To that i dont know if those are true or if it might me error on part of the revierer but i do know the game exhibits stunning graphics. So yes i would recommend you play this game if you liked Witcher 3 but im not far enough in to recommend it if you're here for an Assassins creed game.

󠀡 A.Z.	Recommended	29.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021613237/	To be clear, this is the first Assassin's Creed Game I've ever pre-ordered and also the first I've ever bought on Steam. Simply because I loved the setting and tell you what, I'm really glad I did!+ Really good story, which I can't really get into without spoiling anything.+ Choices actually have consequences, some being small and some big.+ Game is downright gorgeous to the detailed backgrounds and characters, making for some nice screenshots.+ Huge open world where exploration is a must since there are so many interesting and beautiful areas to discover, full of exp, npcs with quests, treasure and things to kill.+ Lots of Romance Options.+ Like the gameplay with versatile combat and movement. Especially since the enemies no longer wait around taking turns for you to just counter attack them and no I did not play Origins so I have no idea if all these changes were implemented then. I also did not watch any videos in case I ever wanted to give it a try after this playing this game.+/- The usual microtransactions crammed into a single player game which makes no sense, instead of just allowing the player to unlock everything by actually playing the game. I say that as a person who has no problem spending a few more bucks to get the cosmetic look I want in a game but only in a multiplayer/mmo always online game like For Honor or PoE. Not going to crucify anyone who actually buys them but it's a no no for me personally, just gonna grind for orichalcum in game, instead.- Having to use Uplay at the same time as Steam, it just isn't as responsive as Steam. I mean there's a reason I bought it on Steam instead of Uplay but I still end up having to use Uplay, lol.Overall the game is amazing and I recommend it to anyone new or old to the Assassin's Creed series. Here's to hoping the next one is actually set in feudal Japan!

As a history buff these two games really let me dive into a bygone era that we have all learned about in school. graphics are awesome, characters are likable, world is amazing. almost every session im inspired to look up the real history behind many of the places you are visiting in these games. 9/10

REALLY REALLY burned out by Origins).+ Great RPG mechanic and system functioned into the game.+ Story is good/great as of now.+ GFX most of the time.+ Less Bugs then any AC game so far.+ Animation has improved upon Origins and possibly others.+ Combat has been kind of improved but also more brutal.+ Game allows you to choose a main female lead protagonist for the first time, as well as a male one (Excluding AC: Liberation)+ NO desynchronisation when killing civillian NPCs.+ Ships are back! And honestly better then and more smoother than AC: IV Black Flag dare I say.+ You get bounty hunted by several bounty hunters if you commit crimes in a way or whatever you've done.+ You may side with the Spartans or Athenians.

Eclair	Recommended	23.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086208810/	Ive been playing games like the witcher 3, nioh, and the last origins as my go to single player games. And i completed witcher 3 and most of its dlc's on hard difficulty. THEN i played odyssey on Nightmare difficulty and exploration mode. Then i must say dont believe the haters. This game has surpassed the witcher 3 (a game i loved) in many ways:-ITS massive beautiful open world that feels alive-ITS combat when done properly and especially in higher difficulties feel rewarding to master-ITS quests and even side quests are beautifully done with tree like choices and conscequence -Leveling up is no longer a drag like origins, as all the side missions are beautifully voiceacted and designed along with the various outcomes.-The controlls may seem familiar to origins but it feels and controls way better-ON pc it is very well optimized, im getting an average of 100 to 120 fps everything maxed out on 1080p with my humble 1080ti.PEOPLE who dislike this game are most probably the people who are just hating on UBISOFT for no proper reason.THE only thing i dislike is that the horse uses the same animations as origins, that is my only
TikKop	Not Recommended	22.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975959943/	Was looking forward to playing this game, and for the first couple of hours it was amazing.But now the game keeps on crashing. So i cant recommend it.

WhoMe	Not Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198325566262/	So to start with a positive note I liked the game at first. But I don't understand the point of leveling up, I went to a fort that was the same level as me and I said I will grind out another level since I am playing on a higher difficulty than normal. Once I leveled up I came back and the fort is now the same level as me. So what is the point of leveling up if everything scales with you. I would have more interest in upgrading my weapons if I wasn't on this grind-fest. I don't mind leveling up, in fact I like it, I just want it to seem worthwhile. Doesn't seem fair that as soon as you progress so does your missions so why try to level up??? Plus they made the bow mechanics worse, I loved the predator bow but now stealth seems to have taken a back seat. I should have just replayed Origins and waited for Red Dead 2.
Dire	Not Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980903354/	Crashes & runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ I get 60fps yet it stutters horrendously, making the in-menu fps graph look like a constant zigzag between 60fps & 24 fps for some reason, no matter what I'm doing. Putting the settings lower than I should have to has mostly relieved it thankfullyThe story also has a weak start (both the story itself and poor conversation animations) but its improving since leaving the starter area. For some reason 2 characters speaking to eachother will pronouce the same words completely differentlyWait for patching
Ally	Recommended	61.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205782080/	I never write reviews. This game deserves a review. It is long and filled with quality, quality content. I am never one to go every single place in a game, but in this game I am doing just that and love every moment of it while never getting bored. 9.9/10Edit: I am also on Nightmare Mode with no HUD. Amazing way to play.
Nickname Failure	Not Recommended	19.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/32246321/	Level scaling is forced... this ruins the game experience for me. First they say it is possible through the option, then after the huge replies, they state that it was intentional and not a bug. That smells like a stinky 360 flip and a huge bummer in comparison to Origins.If you're like me that thinks level scaling makes level grind obsolete, stay away from this. This might change to a positive one once they change this, but before then I will not pick up this game anymore.

Meow the Force be with you	Recommended	9.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198254805445/	The combat is basically the same as in origins only a bit harder (and you really need to get used to the parrying). You can still get overwhelmed so be careful (for example I boarded a ship of my level and they killed my crew instantly and then attacked me as a group).The mappable abilities are also very useful and the spartan kick is soooooo satisfying. I’d say the naval is a bit more fast paced than in black flag (but that could just be me) and I think that boarding is really fun. I like that there are still “shanties” cause otherwise my voyages would be eerily silent. The soundtrack overall is pretty great (as with all ac games). The photo mode has been tweaked a bit and is still very fun to use (especially because the game is beautiful). The only nitpicky thing I have a problem with is the slightly zoomed out camera angle but I could get used to that. The game is overall really fun and I would definetly recommend it to any RPG fan.
r2j2612	Recommended	15.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/r2j2612/	 This is Assassin's Creed Origins, but better & stronger however,ending up with minor nagging issues which are very different than Origins had at launch There is so much to love in this game  Spartan KickThe story (which is pretty tight so far)The Greek SettingThe mountains and vistas Those well known Landmarks and architectureThe CharactersChoices and Consequences e.g I allowed a family with a sickness to live, which ended up wiping the population of an island in later phases of the gameCombat which is tighter than OriginsNaval Combat"Pimp My Ship Simulator" inclusionKassandra's Story Arc  Have to check the Alexios Story Arc to check a specific key event and how it wentExpansive Skill TreeThat HUGE Map But its within those aspects that Odyssey finds its faults Greek/spartan setting but main character missing a shield. What? Werent Spartans known for their shields and war formations?Sometimes the Dialogue tree ventures into weirdly funny terrirtory. May end up undercutting a speciific moment.Romance options are pretty weird to say the least, so farChoice/Consequence dont have any game changing effect. They are just....."there". Thats all.That map size will cause some serious exhaustion trying to 100% or anywhere close to it.Weird camera angle movement when target lock moves about during Combat (carries over from AC:Origins)Performance a litlle worse than Origins on Launch (I played from Early Access)It may sound like nagging but hey, issues are issues. Apart from those small things on the top of my mind, this is a top notch game. It has kept me invested and interested so far, so definitely a Thumbs up for me. Plays "Ok" on an RX 580/R5 1600 FPS drops upto 45 on a 1080p res but thats about it.

Too many glitches:1) In-game store not working; purchased Helix Credits - never showed up. Steam not offering support nor refund. Ubisoft Support is c*** ("network connection" issues).2) During a later stage of the game, there's an outfit you have to wear once. Curiously, the game glitches to a point where you can never switch out of that outfit. Not fun heroing about Ancient Greece dressed like a clown.3) Sometimes severe FPS drops (especially during the large battles). 4) Once I got permanently stuck in a position where I could only exit via a hard reset.

Vonbismark	Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonbismark72/	Ubisoft is like the Monopoly guy's a****** brother. Instead of collecting $200 when you pass go, you have to pay $200.

Don't get me wrong, this game is great and if you loved Black Flag and mythology (like myself), this game will sure be a blast.

Rambo7112	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156994181/	I only have 6 hours in the game (so far), but to tell you something, those were 6 hours straight.I gave up on the AC series after AC4 as they all started feeling the same. The setting was different but the future story and hilariously easy combat just felt so similar that I quit. I heard Origins made major changes and so I looked at Odyssey.If you're coming from the old AC games, Odyssey is a pleasent breath of fresh air. The sideqests and world remind me of Witcher 3. The combat makes you respect your enemies, but still makes you powerful. Every activity is worth your time reward wise and every quest feels different. I know I don't have enough time to say this properly, but AC Odyssey is amazing. It feels like an RPG with good mechanics, story, setting, and more.I also saw some hinted mythological stuff. I'm really excited for that, but I have no idea how they go about it as I never played Origins. If you're wondering if this is worth a buy, I'd say definitely. There's only so many good large RPGs out there and I'd say this is one of them.

Silith	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098677107/	-TL;DR-+Great open-world, good atomsphere (yes it's better than Far Cry 5)+Mostly Interesting and meaningful quests+Impfactful choices-Overly grinding middle-game-Awkward spear movements (seriously)-Helix points, I know it's not necessity but I just dislike it-Enemy radar leaped from one extreme to the other; you're detected too easily that stealth is a useless system overall-Merc system is not only much more trivial than Middle Earth, the infamy thing is beyond simply 'bad design'~Some abilities are ripped off from Middle Earth and have really awkward visual performance in AC context~Heavy RPG emphasis means level difference = nearly everything in combat~System requirement can be quite high, but for one of the best graphic performance around ~quite some contents are about the same to Origin (about 1/4)Overall:8.5/10【About This Game】Odyssey appears to be a compiliation of the most acclaimed features in many games, but fails to be the unique piece of itself.Don't get me wrong; this statement doesn't mean Odyssey isn't a good game - the fact that it successfully merges all of these features into one game is already worth endorsing. It's simply too difficult to call it an 'Assassin's Creed game' when you find more Witcher and Middle Earth in it than any other AC predecessors.It seems to be another 'Ubisoft formula open-world' at the beginning but soon you realise it isn't. Ubisoft didn't lie on this: Odyssey is defintely their largest installment in at least three years time. The world is large, well-crafted and filled with contents, and both protagonists have their unique dialogues and some features. It's just different. This is the only word I find suitable; it's different from the early ACs, and even different from Origin. You can sense the obvious 'referrence' to Witcher and Middle Earth (I just find it funny: Middle Earth began its title by coping many features from AC, and now the table has turned), so much so that the original 'AC style' has been nearly completely disregarded. If Origin at least kept a valuable part of it, Odyssey seems to have discarded all of them without mercy.Still, I like the new quest system (personally I find it even better than Witcher), the ability trees (well some of them really feel awkward but overall is fine) and the story development (it falls trivial at certain points, but not entirely flawed). I won't say everybody will like Odyssey because I already know lots of people, especially many who liked the old ACs, would not. I also agree that this series might really need a longer rest to figure out where it's heading. But come on - we all know there's only one Altaïr, one Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Their stories, no matter how epic and stunning, would not and should not be successed by just some duplicates differed by only cloth designs (yes I AM talking about Syndicate and Unity). I'm very glad that Ubi has tried, and to a great extent successfully accomplished, to present something different.

Weeb-a-BOO! 👻	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Weebaloo/	It just takes everything from AC Origins and makes it better. The game also takes some mechanics from other games and throws those in as well. I have no complaints so far. A couple things to note:1. If you have passed any intro level computer science class then you won't have any performance issues in this game. Only 12-year olds who made their parents buy them an Alienware computer seem to have issues with performance. 2. If someone gives the game a bad review and then blocks comments on their review do not trust them. 3. If the Spartan kick is not the first ability you learn when you hit level 2 then you might as well not play this game. It's just not for you chief.4. Anybody claiming you need to pay micro-transactions to "make the game playable" is a sheep that just listens to Jim Sterling and only contributes to the increasing plague of group-think. Not a single micro-transaction needs to be purchased to enjoy this game. I bought the $60 normal edition of the game and am perfectly happy with it.

Basil_the_Brush	Recommended	22.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198174747730/	And to think I was very close to not buying Assassin's Creed this time around, but I am so pleased I did! Odyssey is a breath of fresh air to the Assassin games. Love the RPG elements and the ship combat (not as good as the ship stuff from Black Flag). The characters are full of life and offer at times some very funny/witty dialog and other times very meaningful. There are unfortunately in game purchases, but to be honest you can play and enjoy the game 100% without them.There is still areas for improvement, but I do truly feel this is a big step in the right direction. For me it is a 9/10 Love It!
Starcatraz	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starcatraz123/	the game itself is nice, new setting, world is beautiful, new skills, new better looting system.No the faults before i get into more positives.- Same animations as Origins.Really. Why? why can't you make new animations? horse riding animation same, running animation too similar, limping animation literally the same, spaghetti legs yet again from Origins when you are using your bow or you are locked onto someone, that is horrible. even your old AC games looked better than this wonky animation.its lazy. and not something to put in a game of this scale.- Same HUD / UIwhy can't you improve on the UI? the difference between AC - AC2 - ACB - ACR - AC3 you saw the UI improve and evolve to be better. in this game there are some QOL improvements, like your quest if finished you get that marker so you can go turn it in. But thats all i can say about it, Make a better UI.- Combat is way too similar to the old game, this time without a shield though, kind of weird considering spartans / athenians used shields all the time, yet we can't use it, but this is aminor complaint.Story so far? im actually interested compared to Origins, it doesn't seem bland, i actually want to know more.That sums up most of my complaints, id say the game is an 8/10 compared to a 7/10 for origins, could be a 9 if t he animations weren't reused.Game just feels made by lazy animators sadly.

Kath Sun	Recommended	64.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dckinsonforsure/	Although some game settings really annoyed me, the story itself's damn fun.
Homosexual Tractor	Recommended	40.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lightdragon1775/	Most of the complaints for this game have been due to bugs and questionable performance, apart from that however, this game is a must have. The game is beautiful, no question about that, although you may want to double check the requirements. Characters and story are fantastic, I love every interaction I can find on this absoloute monolith of a map. I've laughed out loud a few times and there are some cool easter eggs all over the game and I'm not even halfway finished yet.But you don't want to hear about that, you want to know if the core gameplay is fun. And yes, yes it is. Combat and stealth have all been improved on since Origins, which was already pretty good. Controls are refined and polished to the point where I am no longer yelling at an imaginary assassin to get off a rock when I wanted them to run along a path.  Every time I make a mistake I know its my fault and not due to some iffy controls, which is rare from a traditional Assassin's Creed game.And to those who say it's not an Assassin's Creed game, shame on you. You haven't even played the dame game! Story is more compelling than ever and this time I can actually sympathise more with the protagonist as I get to choose what they say now. My advice? Listen to all the reviewers when they say this is the best RPG open world game since the Witcher 3. It really is. I actually prefer this one...TLDR: Just buy the game.
Ghost	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198151290898/	So far i Like Odyssey because of the Massive World and Environment but i would suggest UBISOFT  that in future please avoid RPG element in Assassin's Creed it looks more like Witcher Creed...i would appreciate the developers for NPC Characters...Finally if someone want to play a game with good graphical and story content i would suggest you to buy this game.
Silith	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098677107/	-TL;DR-+Great open-world, good atomsphere (yes it's better than Far Cry 5)+Mostly Interesting and meaningful quests+Impfactful choices-Overly grinding middle-game-Awkward spear movements (seriously)-Helix points, I know it's not necessity but I just dislike it-Enemy radar leaped from one extreme to the other; you're detected too easily that stealth is a useless system overall-Merc system is not only much more trivial than Middle Earth, the infamy thing is beyond simply 'bad design'~Some abilities are ripped off from Middle Earth and have really awkward visual performance in AC context~Heavy RPG emphasis means level difference = nearly everything in combat~System requirement can be quite high, but for one of the best graphic performance around ~quite some contents are about the same to Origin (about 1/4)Overall:8.5/10【About This Game】Odyssey appears to be a compiliation of the most acclaimed features in many games, but fails to be the unique piece of itself.Don't get me wrong; this statement doesn't mean Odyssey isn't a good game - the fact that it successfully merges all of these features into one game is already worth endorsing. It's simply too difficult to call it an 'Assassin's Creed game' when you find more Witcher and Middle Earth in it than any other AC predecessors.It seems to be another 'Ubisoft formula open-world' at the beginning but soon you realise it isn't. Ubisoft didn't lie on this: Odyssey is defintely their largest installment in at least three years time. The world is large, well-crafted and filled with contents, and both protagonists have their unique dialogues and some features. It's just different. This is the only word I find suitable; it's different from the early ACs, and even different from Origin. You can sense the obvious 'referrence' to Witcher and Middle Earth (I just find it funny: Middle Earth began its title by coping many features from AC, and now the table has turned), so much so that the original 'AC style' has been nearly completely disregarded. If Origin at least kept a valuable part of it, Odyssey seems to have discarded all of them without mercy.Still, I like the new quest system (personally I find it even better than Witcher), the ability trees (well some of them really feel awkward but overall is fine) and the story development (it falls trivial at certain points, but not entirely flawed). I won't say everybody will like Odyssey because I already know lots of people, especially many who liked the old ACs, would not. I also agree that this series might really need a longer rest to figure out where it's heading. But come on - we all know there's only one Altaïr, one Ezio Auditore da Firenze. Their stories, no matter how epic and stunning, would not and should not be successed by just some duplicates differed by only cloth designs (yes I AM talking about Syndicate and Unity). I'm very glad that Ubi has tried, and to a great extent successfully accomplished, to present something different.

I would really like to see this game title on Steam Workshop / Nexus mods. Then if some of the really good modders were to make some / a lot of " Titan Quest " mods for the Exploration [ side-quests ] mode of the game that would just be beyond amazing.I have not ventured / progressed that much into the game as of yet but of what I've seen so far is very very impressive, if there is'nt any very large cave systems or even larger creepy ruins to explore I hope that more are added to the main and side quests [ much like Elder Scrolls Oblivion / Skyrim ]One of the best most polished Game Titles yet.

Donald Trump	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DonaldTrumpIsMyMom/	Overall Odyssey is a great game and has surprised me in so many ways. Odyssey has taken some of the best aspects of previous titles and paired them with rpg story elements which combined make Odyssey a really fun and enjoyable game. I havent had this much fun playing a Assassin's creed game since AC2.Story: The story is really good compared to other AC games and in my opinion rivals AC2's story. It manages to really make the setting come to life and also does a very good job at keeping you interested. The game allows if you to make a choices that impact the story which is new to AC. Overall it isn't Witcher 3 or anything, but the game gives you enough meaningful choices that you won't feel disappointed.Graphics: Basically what you would expect out of a AAA game. Graphics are great and have high quality textures.Combat: Still has the normal AC stealth combat system that you would expect, but also has kept the combat from origins. Overall I would say that the combat is pretty good and has a lot of different abilites which you can unlock and use throughout the game.World and Setting: The game does a good job of selling the setting which it is trying to portray. For the most part much of the animous♥♥♥♥♥♥has been left out of greece and instead takes a much more believeable tone that actually manages to make sense within the context of the story.Performance: I have a GTX 1080, I7-8700k and 16gbs of ram and didn't drop below 60fps at max settings. If you have a less powerfull system or have a amd card sorry, but i'm not sure how you're experience will be. From what I experienced the game didn't feel like it was badly optimized or anything, but I simply can't successfully perdict the experienceyou will have if you have worse or different hardware.Overall Odyssey in my opinion is a must buy. This is easily the best AC game I have played and in my opinion is even better than AC2. The way Odyssey pairs AC with rpg elements and story choices makes the game a lot of fun to play.

DilFunk	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingPip3/	Neil deGrasse Tyson would have some issues with the depiction of the night sky. Stars stay in the same position all night. If the Earth is not rotating and not orbiting the sun, then the sun must be orbiting the Earth. Therefore, Ubisoft could potentially support flat earthers. This is the only conclusion that explains the lack of an accurate stellar depiction from Ancient Greece.Or maybe the $499.98 edition (with 20 additional purchases of Totinos Pizza Rolls) comes with physics. At least it is relaltively fun.
janusqc	Recommended	21.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201384691/	Some people have said that this is not a real Assassin's Creed game; I was almost of that opinion until I started playing it. Not only it is an Assassin's Creed game but probably one of the best. This game is gorgeous and quite fun to play. The combat is more challenging than Origins but feels more rewarding. While playing I keep thinking about The Witcher 3; the world, the music, the way the stories are told. This is a great game.Edit: I just took a break from the game to state that there are WAY too many f*** words in this game; it tends to get annoying. I don't think people really talked like that in those times.
kelkin1	Recommended	17.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032374511/	so good! If you don't like microtransactions don't buy anything! It's a single player game so that stuff to me doesn't matter.

taeles	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/taeles/	Pretty simple review.Odyssey takes everything that was Origins and smooths the edges, adds polish to the product in fantastic ways. Toss in even more Witcher 3 (seen a lot of folks refer to this as Witcher's Creed, and not in a bad way). There's also some Farcry 5 in here. The naval ship system is a significant improvement over its token presence in Origins though I still don't think any title will ever quite hit or surpass Black Flag.I give this a 9/10. Not a 10 because I believe there is always room for perfection and if I were to sit back and think long enough I could find something to gripe about. As is though, I've zero complaints :)My hardware:https://us.msi.com/Laptop/GT80S-TITAN-SLI-6th-Gen-GTX-980-SLI/Overviewnote : i got the optional 64gig ram upgradeGame runs consistant mid 40 fps -> 60 fps at 1920x1080 on the default settings the game set up for me on first launch.-three thumbs up-Oh and note, unlike pretty much every other AC title before them, This and Origins mechanically play so identical that you can own both, have both installed and enjoy moving between both as often as you like with no real re-learning curve when you do :)Anyone wondering which to get first? This one feels bigger and the naval gameplay is vastly improved. Aside from that they both play near identical so your decision in my opinion will come down to one question : Greece or Egypt.-waves-
Disquietude	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044898722/	Game is fun, killed by chicken on my 2nd hour play however the price for the game is way too expensive. I mean $134 for Ultimate version... That's is way too much.
xFrost_	Recommended	53.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xFrost_/	*review on 40 hrs. total playtime.AC:Origins with an upgrade.- Have a great story and more choices - RPG in AC is not really bad, Dev. team really done a great job with it.- Great gameplay experience ( Land/Naval combat, leveling, gathering things etc. )- Have lots of side quest ( some are more story to find beside the main quest )- Beautiful Greek world environment
danaketh	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/danaketh/	Possibly the best AC since Ezio. Stronger focus on RPG-like gameplay, naval battles, exploration of a really beautiful world and an interesting story. 18 hours in I've enjoyed every second of it. Mixing the AC lore into Greek mythology and pushing deeper into history, long before the Templars and Assassins was a great choice.4K on Ultra High has returned avg 42FPS, but I haven't really found a place in the game where I would get this low. Most of the time it doesn't fall below 60.Just like every other RPG-like game, it's a bit grindy but you get XP for almost everything you do, making the leveling less noticable unless you wander into a higher level area and get ripped apart by a pack of wolves. But since gear is everywhere (and you can upgrade and modify what you're having), it's hard to find yourself in a situation where you'd be undergeared. Resources for upgrades are also everywhere.Overall it's a great game, and for me, game of the year. The only reason I won't give it full 100% is presence of Helios currency once again. While I don't really give a damn about microtransaction as long as they don't give paying people unfair advantage over others (thus they don't bother me at all in SP-only game), as someone who likes to collect cosmetics in games, I really don't see any way to justify paying more money for a different texture after spending €60 or more on the game itself.So, I'm giving [bold]94%[/bold] as the game is absolutely great!
D3VicEs - Raz	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198216658941/	-Honestly i bought this game thinking im going to refund it after 30 minites but so far i am surprised for the good. The story is interesting, the combat is renovative and the loot and level system work together great. -My worries were that this is going to be Assassin's Creed Origins but with a different story (Which basically it is) but the greec mitholigy is mixed well here to keep you interested, the option to choose what to say really shapes who your character is and who you want to be. -The sea battles are a refreshing break from leaping from roof to roof. -Exploring the game is interesting, hunting animals and other side quests the world has to offer can really make you forget the main quests and make you busy for a while.-Boss fights are challenging and fun

Sadly, the buggy mess that is the PC version is really infuriating. The performance and fluidity; I have no issues with. Its the game-breaking bugs like: A whole area of the main questline not loading its NPCs no matter what I do is stopping me completely from moving forward, the black screen I now get every time I die that requires a restart (making you lose all progression) is also incredibly taxing on my patience. The longer I stay on the forums the more these issues are being flagged as its seems its a ... cumulative corruption? of your save. The game looks great. I just cannot recommend it for PC users in its current state.

Vonbismark	Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vonbismark72/	Ubisoft is like the Monopoly guy's a****** brother. Instead of collecting $200 when you pass go, you have to pay $200. He says you can only pass go only after the minimum requirements have been met just like every other millionaire but as the day to which you can do so draws closer you realize he changed these requirements 2 days before you are allowed to in an attemt to try and get as much money out of you as possible.An amazing game developed with greed being as important as anything else. Don't get me wrong, this game is great and if you loved Black Flag and mythology (like myself), this game will sure be a blast. But it just feels like you are missing out on a ton of stuff...even when you buy the deluxe edition...Unless you give Ubisoft Park Avenue (your home).PS...The AVX requirement crap Ubisoft pulled is a joke and they should be ashamed.

Frugl1	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/frugl1/	Review in progress! - Will update once i'm done with the game AC:OD continues the work that started in Origins: Turning Assassin's Creed into a flow blown action-RPG, this time going all in with dialog choices(that matter) and full gear progression.The game itself plays like a somewhat like a poor man's Witcher 3 in the way it handles it story telling and dishes out sidequests, this is very high praise with Witcher 3 being my all time favorite video game, and Ubisoft is getting VERY close to matching it's quality in story telling.Unlike Witcher 3, however, AC:OD has an amazing combat-system that'll make you feel like a bad♥♥♥♥♥ while still allowing for some pretty challenging boss-fights(as side-content).There is so much content in the game, that map is HUGE, and in my 15 hours of playtime, i've only been to 2 out of like 15 regions.Pick this up and you wont be dissapointed!
xFrost_	Recommended	53.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xFrost_/	*review on 40 hrs. total playtime.AC:Origins with an upgrade.- Have a great story and more choices - RPG in AC is not really bad, Dev. team really done a great job with it.- Great gameplay experience ( Land/Naval combat, leveling, gathering things etc. )- Have lots of side quest ( some are more story to find beside the main quest )- Beautiful Greek world environment
danaketh	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/danaketh/	Possibly the best AC since Ezio. Stronger focus on RPG-like gameplay, naval battles, exploration of a really beautiful world and an interesting story. 18 hours in I've enjoyed every second of it. Mixing the AC lore into Greek mythology and pushing deeper into history, long before the Templars and Assassins was a great choice.4K on Ultra High has returned avg 42FPS, but I haven't really found a place in the game where I would get this low. Most of the time it doesn't fall below 60.Just like every other RPG-like game, it's a bit grindy but you get XP for almost everything you do, making the leveling less noticable unless you wander into a higher level area and get ripped apart by a pack of wolves. But since gear is everywhere (and you can upgrade and modify what you're having), it's hard to find yourself in a situation where you'd be undergeared. Resources for upgrades are also everywhere.Overall it's a great game, and for me, game of the year. The only reason I won't give it full 100% is presence of Helios currency once again. While I don't really give a damn about microtransaction as long as they don't give paying people unfair advantage over others (thus they don't bother me at all in SP-only game), as someone who likes to collect cosmetics in games, I really don't see any way to justify paying more money for a different texture after spending €60 or more on the game itself.So, I'm giving [bold]94%[/bold] as the game is absolutely great!

Cønnor	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TGConnor/	Played all the AC games, this one is the best great changes to the franchise and an incredible setting and story.
Homosexual Tractor	Recommended	40.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lightdragon1775/	Most of the complaints for this game have been due to bugs and questionable performance, apart from that however, this game is a must have. The game is beautiful, no question about that, although you may want to double check the requirements. Characters and story are fantastic, I love every interaction I can find on this absoloute monolith of a map. I've laughed out loud a few times and there are some cool easter eggs all over the game and I'm not even halfway finished yet.But you don't want to hear about that, you want to know if the core gameplay is fun. And yes, yes it is. Combat and stealth have all been improved on since Origins, which was already pretty good. Controls are refined and polished to the point where I am no longer yelling at an imaginary assassin to get off a rock when I wanted them to run along a path.  Every time I make a mistake I know its my fault and not due to some iffy controls, which is rare from a traditional Assassin's Creed game.And to those who say it's not an Assassin's Creed game, shame on you. You haven't even played the dame game! Story is more compelling than ever and this time I can actually sympathise more with the protagonist as I get to choose what they say now. My advice? Listen to all the reviewers when they say this is the best RPG open world game since the Witcher 3. It really is. I actually prefer this one...TLDR: Just buy the game.
Ghost	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198151290898/	So far i Like Odyssey because of the Massive World and Environment but i would suggest UBISOFT  that in future please avoid RPG element in Assassin's Creed it looks more like Witcher Creed...i would appreciate the developers for NPC Characters...Finally if someone want to play a game with good graphical and story content i would suggest you to buy this game.
Penguz	Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/InsaneAu/	Fantastic GraphicsDecent Frame RateOpen World a lot to do and seeMore combat and better options to explore you can either walk,ride or take a boat or swim with the sharks take your pickThis game is everything origins wasn't i enjoy this game because everything you do has different situations if you choose off the path.Sometimes crash when executed through steam on save loadWorth its money i say yes if u enjoy assassin's creed you will enjoy this
hopheylalaley	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087437508/	At the start when i heard that there is a new AC so soon I was afraid it would be quite boring and raw project. To be honest Origins kinda of dissappointed me as I only enjoyed the graphic there but the rest of the game was pretty boring, boring side quests and storyline made me pretty soon play only main storyline and quit. I play every AC so i gave a try to this one and omg i dont regret at all. I played only 3 hours but can already confirm this game worth its money. Its origins with cut bad sides. The game is improved so much. Like the really decided to pay attention to what ppl wanted and didnt like in the prev game+fighting feels way more nice, not that annoyingly slow like in origins with more options like new abilities u chose from talents+shooting with the bow feels amazing in this game+dialogues make even side quests be way more intresting coz now their have soul and side quest's stories are  more intresting and not typical like in Origins where each quest was askin u to find lost son or kill bandits because they are bad+not annoying or boring main characters, i love cassandra already+extremely beautiful setting and sound+more new options in the game, from abilities and headhunters to explorer mode + huge pro: unlike origins, in this game u dont have to battle enemies only face to face, u finally can clear the camp by simply hiding in the bushes and not alarming anyone+enemies wont stop looking for u, they finally feel not like utterly stupid mobs+ even tho some ppl call it a con, it is a pro to me : there is also some unreal stuff in the game connected to the ancient mythology and i believe it is awesome, as i was disappointed that in origins, was no mummies. I know that ppl complain the game should position itsel as a historical game, but come on its a game afterall, purely for fun and it wont replace historical books.+ u can see blood now!Ac Odyssey is a polished "stone ORIGINS" into DIamond
Donald Trump	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DonaldTrumpIsMyMom/	Overall Odyssey is a great game and has surprised me in so many ways. Odyssey has taken some of the best aspects of previous titles and paired them with rpg story elements which combined make Odyssey a really fun and enjoyable game. I havent had this much fun playing a Assassin's creed game since AC2.Story: The story is really good compared to other AC games and in my opinion rivals AC2's story. It manages to really make the setting come to life and also does a very good job at keeping you interested. The game allows if you to make a choices that impact the story which is new to AC. Overall it isn't Witcher 3 or anything, but the game gives you enough meaningful choices that you won't feel disappointed.Graphics: Basically what you would expect out of a AAA game. Graphics are great and have high quality textures.Combat: Still has the normal AC stealth combat system that you would expect, but also has kept the combat from origins. Overall I would say that the combat is pretty good and has a lot of different abilites which you can unlock and use throughout the game.World and Setting: The game does a good job of selling the setting which it is trying to portray. For the most part much of the animous♥♥♥♥♥♥has been left out of greece and instead takes a much more believeable tone that actually manages to make sense within the context of the story.Performance: I have a GTX 1080, I7-8700k and 16gbs of ram and didn't drop below 60fps at max settings. If you have a less powerfull system or have a amd card sorry, but i'm not sure how you're experience will be. From what I experienced the game didn't feel like it was badly optimized or anything, but I simply can't successfully perdict the experienceyou will have if you have worse or different hardware.Overall Odyssey in my opinion is a must buy. This is easily the best AC game I have played and in my opinion is even better than AC2. The way Odyssey pairs AC with rpg elements and story choices makes the game a lot of fun to play.

DilFunk	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MeltingPip3/	Neil deGrasse Tyson would have some issues with the depiction of the night sky. Stars stay in the same position all night. If the Earth is not rotating and not orbiting the sun, then the sun must be orbiting the Earth. Therefore, Ubisoft could potentially support flat earthers. This is the only conclusion that explains the lack of an accurate stellar depiction from Ancient Greece.Or maybe the $499.98 edition (with 20 additional purchases of Totinos Pizza Rolls) comes with physics. At least it is relaltively fun.
janusqc	Recommended	21.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201384691/	Some people have said that this is not a real Assassin's Creed game; I was almost of that opinion until I started playing it. Not only it is an Assassin's Creed game but probably one of the best. This game is gorgeous and quite fun to play. The combat is more challenging than Origins but feels more rewarding. While playing I keep thinking about The Witcher 3; the world, the music, the way the stories are told. This is a great game.Edit: I just took a break from the game to state that there are WAY too many f*** words in this game; it tends to get annoying. I don't think people really talked like that in those times.

I would really like to see this game title on Steam Workshop / Nexus mods. Then if some of the really good modders were to make some / a lot of " Titan Quest " mods for the Exploration [ side-quests ] mode of the game that would just be beyond amazing.I have not ventured / progressed that much into the game as of yet but of what I've seen so far is very very impressive, if there is'nt any very large cave systems or even larger creepy ruins to explore I hope that more are added to the main and side quests [ much like Elder Scrolls Oblivion / Skyrim ]One of the best most polished Game Titles yet.
DJKASMA	Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084630040/	If you liked Assassin's Creed Origins you will love this game. It's similar, yes, but it has lots of new systems to keep you interested. If you're wondering about the review score, most of the negative reviews are from people who can't run the game well (which is baffling to me, since my 1070 and i7 4790k is running the game very smoothly in 1080 on high settings at about 60-70 fps yet I'm seeing lots of people claim to be having performance issues with more powerful gpus and processors) or who are upset about the microtransactions. I don't agree with the microtransactions, all that stuff should be available to unlock in the game. However, what you get when you just buy the standard edition is still such a great game that I must recommend it.

I am returning my copy and will likely not be playing any other Ubisoft games in the future due to their apparent need to alienate large chunks of their potential playerbase.EDIT: Ubisoft claims that they're patching the issue. I'll update my review if/when I can actually play the game.
Myrault's Hinder-Gast	Recommended	56.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/asdqwefzxcv/	What an Odyssey!40 hrs in and its only 3 days! I am enthralled by it.This is the best Assassin's Creed game I've ever played. Ubisoft clearly learned a lot from CDPR's renowned RPG title TW3.In my opinion:Pros:- By far the most entertaining combat system, far better than which in Origins. Combat feels challenging yet fluid and manageable(I play on Hard difficulty and have no problem "assassin" or "sparta" my way through all kinds of situations).- Faaaaaaaaar better story telling and, generally speaking, better story line. Surprisingly I was intrigued by the plot and wanted to keep playing to see the story progress and actually cared about the characters in the game.- More RPG elements that Origins and more depth in character build, which could be a Con for some players because they want the traditional AC games.- Most side quests are well written.- Your decisions matter now, and will have consequences.- Debate with Socrates!- Naval Battles! The changes in naval gameplay they've made from Origins to Odyssey is like the differences of which between AC3 and AC4.- Beautiful scenery, though if you've spent a lot of time in Origins already, then it won't be as astounding as if you first played it without playing Origins(The two titles use the same engine and is visually similar to each other).- Outstanding soundtracks.- Leveling up is relatively quick and is not very grindy.Cons:- Some side quests are not good.- Some dialogues are a bit off.- New combat systems make enemies a bit like "bullet sponges", that is, it takes a lot of slashes and smashes to kill enemies.- Now the enemies levels up with you, which makes leveling up meaningless besides of the skill point you get if you don't upgrade your gears correspondingly(Not a problem for me but I can see some people may have problem with it).Overall Score for the first 40 hrs: 9/10Definitely should try this one out if you have fun playing Origins or other RPG games like TW3.
PlainPickle	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cesto123/	Just under an hour into the game and I've already grown bored of the game's mechanics. Our character runs like he's constantly on the run towards the bathroom and combat feels extremely choppy. Also early on in the game (prelude), I can already tell the game is one of those grind (for a few hundred hours) unless you buy every single DLC and add-on Ubisoft shove in your face. Overall, the game is tedious and the mechanics feel rushed. Next time Ubisoft, thoroughly focus on the aspects of a unique game that will make it fun to play. Don't just forcefully put a BiG map in the game to satisfy the shallow, blunt and spoilt individual who can't appreciate a game for the SMALL things.

Ubisoft pulled a fast one this week with preorders and left off this bit of info that Gen2 and higher processors are required. This is due to the AVX software they are using. This causes the game to get to the splash screen and crash afterwards. There is no word on this being patched out and there is no workaround.

Dragon	Not Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022319339/	Assasin's Greed: Odd I seeOk so as a gamer, I've been having a very repetitive and irratating conversation with myself over this game for the last couple of days. Im going to attempt to get it out because im sick of it being trapped in my head torturing me:How do I start... ok ill start at the ending... This 3d engine is AWFUL!!! Ah, I already feel better, phew.Ok let me explain my opinion of why: First of all, there is no way those screenshots up there represent what this game looks like, i dont know what the hell game those awesome looking screenies are from, but it CANNOT be AC:O. Are they editing the pictures to make the game seem better? perhaps using some super ultra setting of graphics that runs at 1fps yet makes for great screenies?? Sorry but, im really not a fan of deception from the product im supposed to be buying, maybe that makes me an unusual person... but thats just the way it is, id rather not be blatantly lied to...I think basically whats happened is (ive done no actual research but i know what i see and feel), while they were planning AC:U, they basically decided, that it would be best, for one of the best games series ever, to buy a unbelievably cheap 3d engine. it feels to me like its one of those cheap asian 3d engines (no offense to asians, but hey, you get what you pay for) that they use for dodgy mmo's. Since then, they have decided that the best thing for thier profit (ubisoft) is to use this same TERRIBLE 3d engine for game after game after game. The main problem with this being, that no matter how much brilliant work the artists and gameplay designers do, it is absolutely RUINED by an engine that is, pardon my french, utter dog♥♥♥♥♥♥(sorry if that is insulting to dog♥♥♥♥♥♥. How is it dog♥♥♥♥♥♥ one might justifiably ask? Well, lets see: it look and runs terribly. Compare this game to Lotr Shadow of Mordor for instance, looks brilliant, while actually utilising my current hardware 8gb card with beautiful textures, and a constant smooth 60fps performance. AC:O, currently uses about just under 3gb of my cards ram, even in max settings, and only just goes over 30fps in max settings. 30 fps, with other engines, might be acceptable, but NOT with this engine. Anything under 60fps with this engine, feels jittery, sluggish, unresponsive and is extremely hard to ignore while playing. It is absolutely ruining the otherwise wonderful gameplay in my opinion. Looking at the official recommended specs, they dont even list 60fps as a target, the target is 30fps even for very high end hardware. This to me indicates ubisoft knows damn well this engine runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ But they dont care. They are happy to ripoff customers and imo there is no excuse. You can't tell me that this ac franchise hasnt made a TON of money over the years. I've personally bought i think 5 or 6 of these games over the years. Not pirated. Bought. They have no excuse whatsoever to NOT invest that money properly into the game, but clearly they have not done so. Oh well, there is one excuse I can think of: Greed. This game is now Assassins Greed.Will they do a performance patch soon? I think if they do, it will not be anywhere as effective as it needs to be and will basically be a dodgy bandaid solution to what is a gaping maw of a wound. This engine needs to run at LEAST 40% better than it does AND needs to be able to do that while running high res textures which at the moment there is no support for at all. Will they spend the massive amounts of microtransaction and deluxe, gold, ultimate versions money that they have gotten before and are getting again right now to fix this issue? I don't think so, because management needs another new golden throne this month to finish the set of 10 golden thrones they have already at home? I am a hair fraction away from refunding this game...I'm going to finish with a suggestion, that whoever had the power and made the decision to use this 3d engine in the first place, should not just be fired from thier job/s, but also banned from working in the gaming industry ever again.

BirdOfPray	Recommended	42.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZIPTIRCIK/	WARNING: There's a semi-forced microtransaction in the game -> You might have to pay an extra 10 $ to reduce grinding to a normal level. Gaining exp is kinda slow. For an optimum gameplay Ubi wants you to pay for %50 exp boost. This boost is permenant and you can use it on all your saves. Which means you'll buy it once and you will use on everywhere. The biggest con for me in this game: https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/3/17931920/assassins-creed-odyssey-level-grinding-microtransaction-problemFrom what I've seen Ubi devs decided to steal from other games. In the core It's AC:Origins and AC 4:Black Flag(for sea battles) combined with abilities like MGS:V style recruiting, Witcher 3 style dialoges and Shadow of Mordor style blink & assassination (Yes blink, you can teleport in this game with a skill in assassin tree). So Why do I recommend this game? Not because it's an assassin's creed game but because it's a beautiful rpg with nice dialoges, beautiful characters and fun combat. You are no longer playing an assassin. You are a sell-sword who is profiting the turmoil between Spartans and Athenians. Grand battles are super fun. You can choose your side and start butchering. The skill tree allows you to decide how you wanna play. There are 3 skill trees: Hunter(ranged), Warrior(melee) and Assassin(stealth). You can choose however you fit between them.The choices you make have consequences for the first time in AC series. You can choose your character male/female and suit yourself however you like. Game relies heavily on looting. Once you find best pieces you might want to upgrade them.Before I proceed to pros & cons, I'd like to say that I never had crash or seen a game breaking bug. I can run the game around 65 fps in medium-high 1080p.My specs are: Gtx 970, i7-4690k 16 gb ram game is downloaded on sshd. Pros:+ Combat & Skill Tree+ Freedom in dialoges and consequences+ Vast open world map with the ability to use your own ship+ Choosing your own side between two nations+ Historical landmarks and mythological events+ Grand Battles+ Spartan Kick!Cons:- Unrealistic abilities and events: Blinking, Predator Shot...- Semi-forced Pay Wall. (Even for once, it still is a pay wall.)- Not a truly Assassin's Creed game I'd like to seeAs a conclusion: I'd say wait for a sale. But If you liked Origins then this game will satisfy you more thus you might want to buy now. I played and finished all AC games (exluding 2d games like AC China, India, Russia) and I can say that this game is not what I liked to see. But for a rpg-genre this game has a lot to impress you. Forget that you are playing AC, sit back, enjoy the beautiful landmarks in greece and shout this is sparta..!
phil	Not Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ccccvvvvbbb/	System Specs: i7 7700HQ, 1050Ti. Game runs great at 30 - 40 FPS.However: Game crashes every 20 mins of gameplay or upon start up randomly. Feels just like AC Unity all over again. Would not recommend until a patch comes through to fix the crashing issues.

McCarry	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997500794/	This is the best AC ever in my opinion and one of the best rpg for a while.The Pros:Beautiful and huge world full of detail with many different environment.Skills are a nice addition and make the combat even more fun.The story so far is great.The amount of content is humongous.The Naval Combat is a lot of fun.There is a lot of new feature.The Cons:The only downside that i can see its that he is very very demanding,the optimization is not very good.Its way more then just ''Origin 1.5'' its the most ambitious Ac and it is Overall a wonderfull game that i reccomend to everyone who is fan of AC and rpg in general

Fantastic story and mechanics polished beautifully from origins. New mechanics make game even more enjoyable, Bounty hunter system fun and ejoyable but also challnging at times.

Army of Blood	Recommended	52.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkknightrises/	If you loved Assassin's Creed Origins and how it revamped the series, then I highly recommend getting Odyssey. I'm about 18 hours in since I started playing on October 2nd. I loved Origins a lot, it was my favorite game of 2017, and prior to that, I had not loved an AC game since Black Flag. I like this game a lot and I think it's a great follow up to Origins, but I have a few issues so far:1. Why can't I have a shield? Instead your left hand is holding the Spear of Leonidas plot device. 85% of the enemies you fight carry sheilds, but you can't, and it's one less option of character customization and your defense against arrows is now gone.2. The bounty hunters are annoying. The Phylakes in Origins was a great system. But the bounty hunters in this game are akin to captains in Shadow of Mordor/War. I'll be trying to take down a fort, fighting 5-6 enemies and a captain at once, and one or even two bounty hunters will show up and cause me to die or have to run away.Overall love the game, but these are issues that I doubt will be fixed. Still highly recommend!

Oreo	Recommended	38.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/duckee07_93/	I have played Assassin's Creed before, but this game is far the best. Anyone who says its a rip off from Origins, yeah the mechanics and mostly everything has been remade and rethought in this game. For example no 5 kinds of leather, no clothier and blacksmith, just the latter one etc.The atmosphere of the game is 10/10, this is the most historically accurate AC (for a game) I played before, and as a former Classical Philology student I have to say I love the accents, I love the greek, love everything about the game. Sailing the sea is hella fun too.Anyone who loved Origins will love this game as well, this is a step up from the previous installment.On the negative side, the animations could be better, but it isnt tragic, nothing Ubisoft cannot fix in a future patch.The performance of the game is pretty awesome, considering Origins wasnt running so smooth for me (i7 3rd gen, 12gb ram, gtx 1070 g1) and I had to put some settings to medium to have stable 60fps and no stuttering, this game runs better; only turned the fog to medium and ambient occulsion to one back from the highest setting, and i have stable 60fps sometimes that can drop, still nothing Ubi cannot fix in an upcoming patch.The game is maaaaaybe a little more grindy, you need to explore a lot to gather xp for lvling up, I would fix this a little.Last negative point from me, why are the shields gone? :( spartans were famous for their shield work on the battlefield, it would have been cool to have the phalanx formation at some point in conquest battles,TL;DR- Performance is good, patches to improve it can make it even better- Beautiful Ancient Greek world, atmosphere 10/10- Game is immense in size, lot of content.- A tiny bit grindy -> you need to explore to gather xp instead of hopping from quest to quest- Great story

Playing on highest difficulty on standard edition and everything is quite well balanced with a nice bit of challenge in the mix. The story I found to be far better than Origins and it has a lot deeper RP element to it. There is some glitches here and there (Talk function on the controller glitches out at times resulting in not being able to talk to NPCs for a few minutes, the auto ride function on the horse freezes oddly here and there) but other then that it has been amazing so far.

STROYER	Recommended	37.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/STROYER/	A brilliant mastermind, embark in your own Odyssey and explore Ancient Greece  Categories Calification Explanation Value $59.99 - $119.99 The standard edition goes for $60, but the ultimate edition includes everything the game has to offer. There are other several different editions. Gameplay 9 Ubisoft has included major RPG mechanics similar to the ones in The Witcher (Dialogue Choices, Romance, Improved Skill Tree, etc) and has decided to get the naval fights back. Odyssey improves a lot of content from Origins and adds new mechanics to the franchise. Graphics 9 Overall Greece is beautiful, and Odyssey knows how to make it even more majestic, the breath-taking mountains, noisy Athens and the smooth crystalline waters make your Odyssey a nice-looking one. Fighting 8 Odyssey adds the special powers, which can be up to 4 and removes the shield, thus making the combat a more offensive one. But here is a twist, now assassinations are nerfed and you need to be a similar level to the one of your opponents to fulfill it. Overall 9 Odyssey is a great game, new polished mechanics, overall better fighting system and a great story to uncover the secrets of Ancient Greece and of your own past. It will surely guarantee numerous hours of adventure and fun.

Odyssey is so massive and beautiful. I absolutely love it! I bought the standard edition in steam on Oct 6. Played it for around 2.5 hours, encountered stuttering and FPS drops to below 40. So tweaked with some graphic settings and FPS has improved. But the game keeps on CRASHING!!! WTF!!! No error message! Just quits to desktop. And my system meets the 4K requirements! So why the hell is it CRASHING?

wearewindflowers	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088161368/	Okay. So I am a casual gamer. Someone who primary looks for the beauty and scope and feeling in a game (or any piece of art for that matter). Being introduced officially to assassins creed post syndicate, and only really playing Black Flag, I came to this without expectation, ignorant of the AC lore, the current standard of gameplay mechanics or generally what should and shouldn't be in a game. I tend to attempt taking on the view of the crew of developers and directors same for film and art, which puts me in the perhaps enviable position of being united (as much as possible) with the original intent and creative impetus of those people. In short: I am happy with simply riding and experiencing wherever I'm taken, solely for the journey and sharing of art. I found, for me, Oddyssey to be brilliant. Of course visually, sonically and conceptually it shows off, I could simply be happy and content with this. Call me stupid. But I found the whole experience to be magic. I am only beginning and at my usual rate of play might finish the main story in 6 months, but this is fine for me. The combat might be a little awkward, but I have grown into it's structure and functionality, and find it great, with many endless options for creAtiv play. The world is huge and the tasks are fun and interesting never a dull moment and always time to gaze at the picaresque backdrops so wonderfully conceived. The naval portions are awesome too, though I felt the pirate angle suited me more in black flag, but that is subjective, and they are still well thought out and there is nothing like sailing out across the seas to explore new territory. I am really living the journey and can't wait to see what the Odyssey community discovers over the next year. Also I love the music, so big and epic and spacious. So there it is , a laymans brief thoughts. Love it.

ES7	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Easy_Sweep/	Graphics and World: A game that trumps most open world games with its quality and quantity. Optimization/Bugs/Issues: The game runs beautifully with minor bugs and no crashes, the only real problem I've had is frame drops in Athens and Sparta. I've had however more problems on the PS4 version than the PC. Still no major problems at all. Difficulty: Easy to learn. Just pay attention and you'll pick it up quick. Story: Be prepared, it gets wild and is so fun. Is it worth it? YES!!!Are they taking your money? You don't NEED to spend money to progress! If a comment says that its false. I have the game on my PS4 and PC, I paid for the XP boost on my PS4 and got to level 24, while on my PC I got to level 22 without spending a dime stopping at the same point with the same missions. In reality spending money is kind of pointless as there are many ways to level gear, toon, to make the monies, and materials.  Plus you get Helix credits as you advance anyway, people probably didn't mention that. Final Verdict: 8.2/10, Look if you're looking to get into the AC franchise this is the game to do it! The game will get more updates and optimization as time goes on. An overall fun experience unless you're not a fan of these types of RPG Open World games.

TheGreatFang	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatfang/	Really, I can just see this game is similar to the last version of the game. But then, I want to see some improvement. So I try to give a positive review first, let's see how it goes.
Darcy	Recommended	20.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PerfectTemplar/	The best AC game so far imo. I liked origins but this is actually way more fleshed out and polished. The choices actually feel impactful and not a gimmick also. Read someone elses review for more information though.Performance from my perspective:I actually don't hate the performance. It isn't ideal but with a few tweaks to settings that should NOT be in the default presets you can gain massive amounts of performance for little to no visual downgrade.Anti aliasing in this game isn't great and can look worse than turning it off altogether. Volumetric clouds are barely noticeable most of the time but tank frame rates by up to 45%! Set this setting to medium for best performance.Most of the other settings for me had little to no impact on performance (1-2%) Obviously a combination of turning all of them down would be beneficial depending on your hardware. This game looks amazing on high+ settings and pretty garbage on anything lower, it does not scale well on low end systems so it is something to keep in mind. If you have a high end system (GTX 1070 for 1080p and GTX 1080 for 1440p with a good CPU for 60fps high settings) then you should be fine.I run this game at a 99% average 60 FPS with 4K and the only settings below maximum are the ones I mentioned (AA, Clouds). Specs: RTX 2080i7 6700K16GB RAMGame installed to SSD.I also did want to mention that I have encountered very few bugs in this AC title, and I have only crashed once in 16 hours of gameplay. This is definitely just my experience and yours may vary as there are reports of people crashing frequently and experiencing more performance issues.
Texa-Glorious	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145107983/	I  enjoy playing this game but the optimisation ruins the whole experiece. There were always frame drops and micro freezes even when I lowered the setting to low. Hopefully Ubisoft will patch this.

The game is a little bit hard and grindy but it's makes stealth more relevant, makes you think about your approach towards the enemy camp\base.Graphics are AMAZING , best looking AC to date and one of the best looking games ever. I have a GTX 1070 , I7 7700 , 16 GB of RAM and the game runs on Ultra without a problem, solid optimization. It is a good game to play, plenty of stuff to do.

TheGreatFang	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thegreatfang/	Really, I can just see this game is similar to the last version of the game. But then, I want to see some improvement. So I try to give a positive review first, let's see how it goes.
Darcy	Recommended	20.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PerfectTemplar/	The best AC game so far imo. I liked origins but this is actually way more fleshed out and polished. The choices actually feel impactful and not a gimmick also. Read someone elses review for more information though.Performance from my perspective:I actually don't hate the performance. It isn't ideal but with a few tweaks to settings that should NOT be in the default presets you can gain massive amounts of performance for little to no visual downgrade.Anti aliasing in this game isn't great and can look worse than turning it off altogether. Volumetric clouds are barely noticeable most of the time but tank frame rates by up to 45%! Set this setting to medium for best performance.Most of the other settings for me had little to no impact on performance (1-2%) Obviously a combination of turning all of them down would be beneficial depending on your hardware. This game looks amazing on high+ settings and pretty garbage on anything lower, it does not scale well on low end systems so it is something to keep in mind. If you have a high end system (GTX 1070 for 1080p and GTX 1080 for 1440p with a good CPU for 60fps high settings) then you should be fine.I run this game at a 99% average 60 FPS with 4K and the only settings below maximum are the ones I mentioned (AA, Clouds). Specs: RTX 2080i7 6700K16GB RAMGame installed to SSD.I also did want to mention that I have encountered very few bugs in this AC title, and I have only crashed once in 16 hours of gameplay. This is definitely just my experience and yours may vary as there are reports of people crashing frequently and experiencing more performance issues.
Texa-Glorious	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145107983/	I  enjoy playing this game but the optimisation ruins the whole experiece. There were always frame drops and micro freezes even when I lowered the setting to low. Hopefully Ubisoft will patch this.

JusBlaze28	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JusBlaze28/	I seen one of my friends playing AC: Odyssey on his Twitch stream which may me decide to get it myself. I downloaded the game anxious to play it so I start it up & before I can get through the storyline, it crashes. So I re-started the game & the same thing happens multiple times. I know the game JUST came out but come on man! Hopefully you guys find a solution to this bug issue that's occurring... Sincerely,A very unhappy gamer

Stackie	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082425654/	THIS! IS! SPARTA!!!Amazing game love the detail put into the game design and asthetics. Well worth the money.After playing Origins on Console & PC. i can tell you Odyssey has more depth into stealth, combat, and Dialouge. Although some choices do feel forced i love the direction Ubisoft is heading with the Series. If Ubisoft is to stay on this path i cant wait for the next one to see how they follow up from this F@@@ing Amazing Game, and what changes they will bring.Pros:An immersive story with an excellent narrative and dozens of plot twist to keep you on edge.Extensive world with countless locations to explore and regions to conquer.The choices you make will have a longlasting impact on the world that surrounds you and in the quests you undertake.Last but not Least.Sailing returns in all its splendor and it feels better than ever.

JOHNSON	Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/johnsondtx/	If you liked Assassin's Creed: Origins, you'll like Odyssey too. The setting is different with a new array of in-game mechanics while also preserving the fresh new feel/look that came with AC: Origins.If you didn't like the old Assassin's Creed games, you might like this one. Many avid fans of AC have exclaimed their disappointment with the newer titles, and how it's basically "not even Assassin's Creed anymore". So give it a shot.
Patrick Star	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154314860/	This game, I've played for 6 hours, is amazing. I love the story thus far, and Greece's landscape is a masterpiece. I don't have the best PC but am able to run this on higher graphics than AC Origins and much better than I could run AC Origins. The microtransactions are minute and useless. I have an i5-8600k overclocked to 4.0 mHz, 16 gig ram, gtx 1060 6gb, and I run this fairly flawlessly at an average of 60 fps on the Very High graphic setting. To those complaining about it no longer being a true "Assassin" game; you would be the people complaining of an overused formula. Black Flag was my favorite AC and the reintroduction of sailing being a major part of the game is welcomed. I'm playing as Kassandra and she tends to have more of a playful attitude. The decision-making RPG element is fairly good, although it's annoying that certain decisions don't matter when it seems like they would.
Deaddroth	Recommended	92.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198269558397/	Ok, Ubisoft have won me back, they've been making great games lately, If Assassin Creed from now on would be as good as this bring them on every year, great ARPG, now add some of the soulsborne fighting mechanics "stamina bar is really needed" & builds and this would be the best thing ever,

CuddlyKrogan	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995246200/	This game is awesome. Also the ppl compaling about mxs are full of♥♥♥♥♥♥and haven't actually played the game and are using clickbait and drama to get views. This game does not show u the mx store first thing, that is a blatant lie and those mxs are skins and boosters that are useless as u already lvl very fast in the game. These mxs are useless and do not affect gameplay whatsoever, your being lied to if told otherwise. Another lie is that the game locks content behind mxs, this isn't true- there is maybe a 5 minute preorder mission that u can get thru uplay points by just playing the game. This game is beautiful and u can tell the developers are passionate, its a shame that lazy critcs are finding an excuse to hate the game so they get views when they haven't even played it yet. (they call others greedy when they make clickbait and outrage videos to get money, not hypocritcal at all) edit: Now that i looked, there is in fact no content on sale in the store other than the season pass which in orgins gave some pretty meaty xpacs similar to the witcher 3. How come witcher 3 can have season passes but this game cant? This game dosent lock content off and those big dlcs are expensive to produce, so they need some return of investment. Otherwise loving the game so far, it has very likeable and chrasimatic chracters :D pt2- also to consider people thinking the game is throttled instead of just calling them liars..the game isnt throttled but the xp boost gives the illusion that it is. The game can be pretty challenging if u are underleveled so they think that by buying the xp boost they can just speed thru the story. What they need to understand is that this is an rpg, there needs to be a sense of progression. If u just do the main quest it is doable but will offer more of a challenge. If the xp boost wasn't there ppl would realize this is intenitonal, you are meant to avoid some mobs if they are above u, but later u can come back and kick his♥♥♥♥♥ Alternatively u can turn the game to easy and speed thru the story if u want..but unlike early ac titles this game can be a challenge which is great. You can also use stealth to take down difficult enemy camps..which i realized i could just do so that will probably help and what i was probably meant to do ;D. Anyways wish me luck..but this game is easily 1 of the best ac games and is beautiful and more importantly a blast to play with great storytelling. It's increadible how much this game improved upon orgins. Btw im enjonying this more than i ever did the witcher 3. I dont give a ♥♥♥♥.
Nemesis7884	Recommended	30.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997960269/	This game is amazing - so let me start by saying that i have never been an AC player...never played the first or old games, my first one was origins (which i didn't really play due to time constraints) - so this is my first AC experience.I guess i can see why people that love the original concept think this is no longer an AC game - but i love open world rpg's ala TES and Fallout - and i LOVE this game. Maybe they should continue this type of rpg game under a new brand instad of AC to make both type of player's happy...not sure - but i definatly love the newest installments of fallout and AC. So here is what i like and didn't like:Positive + loot hunt - you get so much loot and it also looks very varied and interesting+ combat system - fun and engaging and allows for a variety of tactics depending on your playstile and prefernces+ stories & characters - the voice actor for alexios is amazing+ graphics - the game is stunningly beautiful - but its tough to get good fps...i run everything high on 4k and get 30-60 fps on a 1080ti (was hoping the 2080ti would fix it...but 30% more wont cut it)+ exploration (mode) and treasure hunting(+) ships, naval combat, underwater exploration etc.... i feel that everything ship/water related isn't 100% there yet but close(+) decisions and consequences - baby steps....but in the right direction(+) parcouring - it works very well but at times its a bit fiddly(+)  mercenary system - this is a great addition but i do feel they have still room to improve and expand on it(+) animations - they are good, but not great...Negative- Leveling / Difficulty curve; so im playing on hard (i like to be slighly challenged but don't like cheesing my way through fights) and the leveling is kinda sub optimal as in the beginning i was usually 1-2 level to low which made fights very difficult and now im constantly 2-3 levels above and fights are insanely easy...there is some slight level scaling - i understand they kinda wanted to get a good mix between distinct leveling areas and players getting stronger but also continously providing a challenge; i feel they need to improve on this to create a smoother difficulty curve...i might have to switch to nightmare and see how that turns out...but when fighting mercenaries, even 1 lvl difference hurts either way.(-) jack of all trades; this is a bit the Skyrim Problem; while you cannot unlock all abilities, you're still gonna be a jack of all trades...if they want to go the rpg's route i feel they need to make the different paths even more distinct; saying that i understand this makes balancing even more difficult and i prefer good balancing over this....so yeah..i do hope they will continue along this way with AC...and im really excited to see the next project...Rome?

Without it, stealth is pretty much ruined, especially if a captain/commander/gold-badged fella is between you and your Target.

Lets be straight about this, Odyssey is the best AC ever made, and thats something as a follow-up title to the incredible AC Origins. The attention to detail for ancient Greece is amazingly well done, all within excellent combat and exploration. The world is large, vivid and alive; I've been unable to put this game down. Another amazing job by the AC/Ubisoft team.Overall rating: 9.3/10

Up until now, I've never had an excuse to downvote a game.  However, due to a critical feature that was left absent from the minimum hardware specs, that would otherwise force me to upgrade my CPU in order to run the game, it's left me more than a little upset.  My hardware specs are far from the best, but they're still more than capable of running almost any game today at High settings.Pentium G4560 @ 3.5 MhzGeForce GTX 1060 6 GB16 GB DDR4 RAMWindows 10Ubisoft failed to update the specifications prior to AC: Odyssey's release, which essentially says that if anyone wanting to run this game has below a certain level of i5 processor, you're out of luck.  This has left many people hanging out in the wind and without any recourse.  If Ubisoft is forcing people into upgrading their hardware, because of a feature that they left absent from the minimum specs and failed to notify anyone of the updated requirements until AFTER a game's release, then they just lost a customer.

Greatjon Umber	Recommended	51.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/greatjon_umber/	Judging whether or not you’ll want to play this game is most easily done by comparing it to its direct predecessor, Assassin’s Creed Origins, with which Odyssey shares a lot of its DNA.I played nearly 100 hours of Origins but was surprised it received nearly universal praise. Origins is more polished than a typical AC game due to its extra year of development time, and the setting of Ancient Egypt is wonderful, but I found there to be severe flaws in the foundation of what that game does regarding stealth, combat, and story. Typically with an Assassin’s Creed game I expect a great core experience that often lacks polish in terms of stability due to the grueling yearly release schedule from Ubisoft that doesn’t allow adequate QA time to fix such things. With Origins, it was the opposite—The core experience was lesser than Syndicate’s, but the game was very polished. It ran well and looked gorgeous.The universal praise Origins received was only skin-deep, full of people raving about its wonderful setting and graphics while neglecting the deeper issues the game had at its core. Odyssey, then, reminds me a lot of what Syndicate was to Unity; an improvement of the core mechanics and the smoothing out of the previous game's rough edges.IF YOU'RE IN A RUSH: If you liked Origins and want more of something similar, then you’ll probably love Odyssey. It’s just Origins with deeper and more rewarding roleplaying, far better combat, a much better story, more practical skill trees, and some key new features to provide enough new territory that it doesn’t simply feel like Origins in a new setting.For more detail, feel free to read on.The most hyped aspect of the game is its expanded RPG elements. Since Unity, which introduced customizable gear, there have been growing light RPG elements to the Assassin’s Creed series, including the introduction of skill trees in Syndicate. Continuing this trend, Odyssey has become a full-blown action RPG rather than just an open world game with some RPG elements. It’s clear the team was playing a lot of Witcher 3 during development, as more effort is put into Odyssey’s main story and side quests, and the addition of dialogue options is a welcome breath of fresh air to the series. This was hampered, though, by some puzzlingly bad voice acting by the main character, Alexios’, voice actor (I didn’t play as Kassandra so I can’t comment on her performance). The story features deeper, more interesting characters than Origins and had me genuinely caring about what happened for the first time since Assassin’s Creed II. Bravo to Ubisoft for realizing that good writing is irreplaceable.Combat in Origins was one of my chief complaints. The animations felt stilted and artificial, and the combat itself was difficult to judge due to the unrealistic speed at which animations played. The game felt like it was aping Dark Souls without understanding what makes its combat great. Combat in Odyssey, however, has several more layers of polish. Animations seem more natural, dodging takes place over a judgeable distance, easy countering is back. Adding depth are Adrenal Skills, which basically act the way the single Overpower skill did in Origins. There are a number of different Adrenaline skills to unlock within the skill tree, with each providing a different facet than the other.The skill tree is greatly improved from Origins, which had few useful skills and a lot of what felt like unexciting padding that didn’t change gameplay greatly. Many of the abilities that were locked to gear in Origins have been instead relocated to the skill tree (different bow styles from Origins are now tied to skill unlocks), which gives you far greater freedom in customizing the way your character looks via gear. It’s a very good decision as the skill tree from Origins felt like something that was tacked-on because somebody on the team decided “we should have skill trees in this game”. The skill tree in Odyssey feels more natural and has a huge impact on gameplay.A lot of the new abilities feel inspired by WB’s Shadow of Mordor series. Chiefly among this inspiration, though, is a fantastic port of what was obviously inspired by Shadow of Mordor’s Nemesis system. Odyssey takes place during the Peloponnesian War in 431 BC, and this war has a number of the different city states of Greece going at one-another; chiefly Athens and Sparta. Odyssey’s modified version of the Nemesis system depicts what feels like a living, breathing war going on around you. Athens and Sparta change territory through the story and your actions, with each city’s forces being easily identifiable, and each occupying different fortresses as they move. They have leaders, cities you can disrupt, money and materiel you can steal and destroy. There are various war leaders and mercenaries that function as the actual Nemeses from the Shadow games, and somehow the team has made this system feel more natural in an Assassin’s Creed game than the Lord of the Rings games which inspired it. It’s the main draw of Odyssey, and it’s a huge one. It all works smoothly, indicative of significant polish, and the game is worth playing just to experience it even if you were burnt out on Origins.There are a number of more minor new features which fixed complaints I had about Origins. Number one of which is a dedicated (though limited to the open world) Quicksave feature for the first time in the Assassin’s Creed series. As a hardcore stealth fan I despise any game that features stealth without quicksaving and makes me rely on checkpoints. It’s too easy to experience a bug (especially in AC games) and have your entire stealth run of a fort become ruined. This alleviates it, and it’s a fantastic quality-of-life addition. There are also now non-lethal takedowns and enemy recruiting, deepening stealth gameplay.History blurbs are also back! This eliminates one of my chief personal complaints about Origins: Ripping out these history blurbs and putting them in a separate gameplay mode from the main game. As a fan of historical fiction I want to learn about these settings as I play, and Origins taking that away really damaged the experience for me. They are now back as a map feature, allowing you to hover over map markers for a brief paragraph of background.I do have some complaints, though. The balance of the game is off, requiring a bit too much grinding if you’re not clearing every map marker like I am. The leveling system is also far too rigid, turning enemies one level higher than you into health sponges. This should be addressed in a future balance patch. It didn’t affect me much because I’m always overleveled, but I could see how someone focused only on the main story would become frustrated.The game also removed shields from combat, which is puzzling in a game about Greek combat—A style of combat based almost wholly on the use of a heavy bronze shield. I loved the shields in Origins and am puzzled and disappointed to see them go.The game also runs questionably—my 1080 couldn’t hold 60 fps on ultra settings at 1080p. It needs a performance patch.In the end, much of Odyssey looks the same as Origins: The menus are nearly identical. You have a pet bird to scout with. The running and climbing animations are the same. The buildings look similar. The graphics are of the same quality. But these similarities--like the critical praise for Origins--are only surface-deep.Odyssey fixes Origins’ faults and adds wonderful new features. If you liked Origins or you’re a fan of the series then you’ll love Odyssey. It's the culmination of what the past 3-4 Assassin’s Creed games have been introducing, and it’s become one of my favorites in the series.You can find more reviews like this by following my Curator page!

You will never have enough resources to upgrade your legendary equipments up to your level, or engravings or your ship, unless you waste dozens of hours scouring the land for those '+2 iron' ores and '+3 soft leather' deers. Normally this could be addressed easily by adding an in-game slider that multiplies the resources earned or reduces the costs so that players can adjust the level of grind to their liking. But nope. Why do that, when you can charge real money for in-game resources? It is a bloody shame. It turns a 9 to a 5. I can not encourage this attitude from developers. So I am forced to leave a negative review for a game that I am otherwise enjoying.

Its a solid sandbox with a likeable protagonist and some really gorgeous scenery... but the microtransactions are so utterly shameless, disgusting and unnecessary that I just can't. They really are revoliting, pages and pages of additional purchases in a product that they're happily selling for up to $120. Now, if it were a cosmetic or two I might not be so irritated, but its in game items and xp boosters, and I in no way believe that they haven't balanced the game to pressure the audience into making those purchases.Ubisoft is not the worst company in gaming, but they're still scumming.

Reminds me of the Witcher 3 a lot, its incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion way better than Origins (I couldn't get into Origins ; wasn't for me)I've been a AC fan since the first game, I've loved everything up to Black Flag. Everything after I really didn't feel the need to play. I didn't dislike the future games but they weren't for me. They looked ok, but wasn't AC. That doesn't justify the hate the series get for moving in a different direction though, but I must admit I still miss Ezio :(
YiLL	Recommended	41.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RVMaknae/	 Assassin's Creed Odyssey   A journey longer than that of Odysseus   📋 Premise  It's been a little less than a year since Assassin's Creed Origins was released and we already have a brand new game in our hands. After Origins revolutionized the way we approach the franchise's games, Ubisoft is surfing the success wave with their brand new Assassin's Creed Odyssey, adding fire to their open-world series. From an all too flat desert scenery, we move on to a flourishing, stunning and vibrant world. Greece welcomes you with sun-drenched, lushy breathtaking lands and seas. Just one warning before you go: beware of the snakes in the grass. ✅ Pros:  • An immersive story with an excellent narrative and dozens of plot twist to keep you on edge• Extensive world with countless locations to explore and regions to conquer• A protagonist can be either female or male• The choices you make will have a longlasting impact on the world that surrounds you and in the quests you undertake• Sailing returns in all its splendor and it feels better than ever• Enjoyable companions and side characters• A very clean user interface as well as neatly organized menus ❎ Cons:  • The hyped "romance system" is nothing more than a series of one night stands: the options feel forced and add nothing to the story• Weird facial expressions• Dialogue choices can feel inconsistent 🎮 Gameplay: in depth   General information  Assassin's Creed Odyssey follows Origins in its footsteps, retracing its template and borrowing from the best open-world designs to craft an enrapturing experience. Every region and island in Greece has been recreated on a grand scale with a startling attention to details. The new exploration feature, Explorer Mode, minimizes the game's suggestions by removing waypoints and replacing them with three clues, leaving more room for the players to find out where to go. It's the very first Assassin's Creed installment in which we are asked whether we want to play as a male or female character: Alexios or Kassandra. No matter our choice here, the follow up will remain the same and the brothers will merely be exchanging places in the narration.Speaking of choices, we can now pick from multiple answers during dialogues: asking for further information, accepting or declining a job, or very binary choices of good and evil in which we must decide whereas to kill an enemy or to show mercy. All this will eventually shape our character towards one of the many endings that Odyssey has to offer. However, the system might feel underwhelming at times.Odyssey also makes a first attempt in engaging in romantic relationships, regardless of your gender. However, it fails terribly to deliver a proper experience and gives more room to a light-hearted series of one night stands. If the romantic aspect is awkward enough when it's offered as a reward, it's even more so when it's presented to us through dialogue choices, often breaking the seriousness of the moment and the flow of the conversation itself.We can roam the regions cleaning enemy outposts, weakening the two factions or involving ourselves in large-scale battles to conquer regions for Sparta or Athens - we're mercenaries, after all. It's thanks to these last two features that the experience Odyssey offers is way more substantial. Story  For my first playthrough, I decided to take on the role of Kassandra: although the narrative stays the same no matter whom we play as Kassandra seems to be the most charismatic and charming of the two siblings.We begin our story in Kephallonia, in the Korinthian Gulf, as a Spartan outcast that has been raised on the island ever since we were but a kid. The past hasn't forgotten about our character, and it will suddenly come hunting us, forcing us to leave the safe shores of Kephallonia to embark on a journey, unsuspecting of the web of lies that we will be uncovering. The story branches in many different directions and the choices we make will lead us to one of the different endings.The enemy in Odyssey goes by the name of Cult of Kosmos, which is none other than the Templars as we know them. Discovering the Cult will open up a new menu through which we'll be able to take a look at the whole Cult's chain of command. Even though most of the cultists are untrackable at first, gathering more information by killing cult members will allow us to reveal their identities and track them down. Combat Combat is divided in three specializations: Hunter, Warrior, Assassin. Each of these has many different sets of skills that can be mixed between themselves and used to create various combinations allowing different approaches. We have 4 skills slots shared between Warrior and Assassin skills and another 4 slots that are for Hunter skills only.Kicking people down from a cliff just like Leonidas in 300? We can do that. In every combat I engaged in I was able to experiment with a huge spectrum of unique approaches allowing me to lure enemies to their own death, or engage in a battle head on. The animations are smooth and the dodging and parrying mechanics, feeling a bit odd at first, will just come naturally after getting the hang of them. Most encounters won't feel particularly hard nor daunting unless you purposefully seek stronger enemies to fight or take part in Conquest Battles - which will become available relatively soon in the early game section. Content  Assassin's Creed Odyssey, much like Origins before, offers hundreds of hours of content divided between main quests (branched in 3 storylines), side quests, exploring and upgrading your gear. There are countless locations that are worthy to be visited and even more mysteries to be uncovered hidden in Greece.Odyssey can easily take from 100 hours to 200 hours to enjoy its full potential. 🔬 Technical Analysis   Graphics  Stunning enough to leave you with your mouth agape. The world is green, vibrant, with incredible lighting effects (absolutely breathtaking when exploring a forest during sunset) and studded with flourishing locations. The wreckages and sunken temples that we can find under the sea are equally beautiful, sided with a handful of sea creatures. Music  Especially worth mentioning here is Odyssey's ambient music. In many occasions, whilst exploring, it felt like being thrown back in Skyrim. It's nice, relaxing, pleasing to the ears but it also perfectly transitions to battle themes, picking up its pace. Performance  The game runs particularly well and I haven't noticed any huge stutters. However, after running the game for some hours with no breaks, a few freezes started happening. HUD  The HUD is clean with a very similar layout to what we had in Origins. Only the essentials are consistently shown on screen (such as HP, Adrenaline, Skills...) and everything else can be accessed through the menu. Bugs Encountered  No game-breaking bugs have happened so far, nor did I have problems during quests.Got stuck a few times while climbing, but letting go (pressing C) usually fixed the problem. Wrapping up  Ubisoft is taking baby steps in shaping open-world games. Odyssey is the perfect example of this: they're taking many ideas and throwing them at a sticky wall to see what will last on it, in the long run. There are many aspects of Odyssey that overall feel unpolished or unnecessary, however, it's a game that still manages to hit the mark and will still offer the right amount of enjoyment and content for the money it's asking for.

The last few years I even started to support you because you were doing better.  But alas here we are.  The game is fantastic.  I love the setting, SOME of the characters, and the gameplay is fun to me (except naval combat isn't nearly as fun as it was in black flag IMO).  BUT, and this is a big but and i cannot lie, The microtransactions are disgusting.  You WILL hit an XP wall even if you say "Oh ok I just won't buy the bonus xp" and this WILL distroy the fun you were having up until that point.  Where you either need to grind and grind and grind for hours just to be able to play the next story quest oooooor F*** you give me money.  Thems the brakes.  I'll change this review if they patch that but I doubt they will.

Ubisoft has acctually put in grind walls in the game, and then put in "time-savers" that are expensive as ♥♥♥♥! Its disgusting behaviour from the developers. I will because of this give the game a negative review as a protest against this.
gasmaskangel	Not Recommended	3.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gasmaskangel/	I really wish I could reccomend this game. Its a solid sandbox with a likeable protagonist and some really gorgeous scenery... but the microtransactions are so utterly shameless, disgusting and unnecessary that I just can't. They really are revoliting, pages and pages of additional purchases in a product that they're happily selling for up to $120. Now, if it were a cosmetic or two I might not be so irritated, but its in game items and xp boosters, and I in no way believe that they haven't balanced the game to pressure the audience into making those purchases.Ubisoft is not the worst company in gaming, but they're still scumming.
大悟	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/daigokazuya/	I had no expectations with this game, for me AC died along with Desmond. This game though, its amazing. Reminds me of the Witcher 3 a lot, its incredibly enjoyable and in my opinion way better than Origins (I couldn't get into Origins ; wasn't for me)I've been a AC fan since the first game, I've loved everything up to Black Flag. Everything after I really didn't feel the need to play. I didn't dislike the future games but they weren't for me. They looked ok, but wasn't AC. That doesn't justify the hate the series get for moving in a different direction though, but I must admit I still miss Ezio :(
YiLL	Recommended	41.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RVMaknae/	 Assassin's Creed Odyssey   A journey longer than that of Odysseus   📋 Premise  It's been a little less than a year since Assassin's Creed Origins was released and we already have a brand new game in our hands. After Origins revolutionized the way we approach the franchise's games, Ubisoft is surfing the success wave with their brand new Assassin's Creed Odyssey, adding fire to their open-world series. From an all too flat desert scenery, we move on to a flourishing, stunning and vibrant world. Greece welcomes you with sun-drenched, lushy breathtaking lands and seas. Just one warning before you go: beware of the snakes in the grass. ✅ Pros:  • An immersive story with an excellent narrative and dozens of plot twist to keep you on edge• Extensive world with countless locations to explore and regions to conquer• A protagonist can be either female or male• The choices you make will have a longlasting impact on the world that surrounds you and in the quests you undertake• Sailing returns in all its splendor and it feels better than ever• Enjoyable companions and side characters• A very clean user interface as well as neatly organized menus ❎ Cons:  • The hyped "romance system" is nothing more than a series of one night stands: the options feel forced and add nothing to the story• Weird facial expressions• Dialogue choices can feel inconsistent 🎮 Gameplay: in depth   General information  Assassin's Creed Odyssey follows Origins in its footsteps, retracing its template and borrowing from the best open-world designs to craft an enrapturing experience. Every region and island in Greece has been recreated on a grand scale with a startling attention to details. The new exploration feature, Explorer Mode, minimizes the game's suggestions by removing waypoints and replacing them with three clues, leaving more room for the players to find out where to go. It's the very first Assassin's Creed installment in which we are asked whether we want to play as a male or female character: Alexios or Kassandra. No matter our choice here, the follow up will remain the same and the brothers will merely be exchanging places in the narration.Speaking of choices, we can now pick from multiple answers during dialogues: asking for further information, accepting or declining a job, or very binary choices of good and evil in which we must decide whereas to kill an enemy or to show mercy. All this will eventually shape our character towards one of the many endings that Odyssey has to offer. However, the system might feel underwhelming at times.Odyssey also makes a first attempt in engaging in romantic relationships, regardless of your gender. However, it fails terribly to deliver a proper experience and gives more room to a light-hearted series of one night stands. If the romantic aspect is awkward enough when it's offered as a reward, it's even more so when it's presented to us through dialogue choices, often breaking the seriousness of the moment and the flow of the conversation itself.We can roam the regions cleaning enemy outposts, weakening the two factions or involving ourselves in large-scale battles to conquer regions for Sparta or Athens - we're mercenaries, after all. It's thanks to these last two features that the experience Odyssey offers is way more substantial. Story  For my first playthrough, I decided to take on the role of Kassandra: although the narrative stays the same no matter whom we play as Kassandra seems to be the most charismatic and charming of the two siblings.We begin our story in Kephallonia, in the Korinthian Gulf, as a Spartan outcast that has been raised on the island ever since we were but a kid. The past hasn't forgotten about our character, and it will suddenly come hunting us, forcing us to leave the safe shores of Kephallonia to embark on a journey, unsuspecting of the web of lies that we will be uncovering. The story branches in many different directions and the choices we make will lead us to one of the different endings.The enemy in Odyssey goes by the name of Cult of Kosmos, which is none other than the Templars as we know them. Discovering the Cult will open up a new menu through which we'll be able to take a look at the whole Cult's chain of command. Even though most of the cultists are untrackable at first, gathering more information by killing cult members will allow us to reveal their identities and track them down. Combat Combat is divided in three specializations: Hunter, Warrior, Assassin. Each of these has many different sets of skills that can be mixed between themselves and used to create various combinations allowing different approaches. We have 4 skills slots shared between Warrior and Assassin skills and another 4 slots that are for Hunter skills only.Kicking people down from a cliff just like Leonidas in 300? We can do that. In every combat I engaged in I was able to experiment with a huge spectrum of unique approaches allowing me to lure enemies to their own death, or engage in a battle head on. The animations are smooth and the dodging and parrying mechanics, feeling a bit odd at first, will just come naturally after getting the hang of them. Most encounters won't feel particularly hard nor daunting unless you purposefully seek stronger enemies to fight or take part in Conquest Battles - which will become available relatively soon in the early game section. Content  Assassin's Creed Odyssey, much like Origins before, offers hundreds of hours of content divided between main quests (branched in 3 storylines), side quests, exploring and upgrading your gear. There are countless locations that are worthy to be visited and even more mysteries to be uncovered hidden in Greece.Odyssey can easily take from 100 hours to 200 hours to enjoy its full potential. 🔬 Technical Analysis   Graphics  Stunning enough to leave you with your mouth agape. The world is green, vibrant, with incredible lighting effects (absolutely breathtaking when exploring a forest during sunset) and studded with flourishing locations. The wreckages and sunken temples that we can find under the sea are equally beautiful, sided with a handful of sea creatures. Music  Especially worth mentioning here is Odyssey's ambient music. In many occasions, whilst exploring, it felt like being thrown back in Skyrim. It's nice, relaxing, pleasing to the ears but it also perfectly transitions to battle themes, picking up its pace. Performance  The game runs particularly well and I haven't noticed any huge stutters. However, after running the game for some hours with no breaks, a few freezes started happening. HUD  The HUD is clean with a very similar layout to what we had in Origins. Only the essentials are consistently shown on screen (such as HP, Adrenaline, Skills...) and everything else can be accessed through the menu. Bugs Encountered  No game-breaking bugs have happened so far, nor did I have problems during quests.Got stuck a few times while climbing, but letting go (pressing C) usually fixed the problem. Wrapping up  Ubisoft is taking baby steps in shaping open-world games. Odyssey is the perfect example of this: they're taking many ideas and throwing them at a sticky wall to see what will last on it, in the long run. There are many aspects of Odyssey that overall feel unpolished or unnecessary, however, it's a game that still manages to hit the mark and will still offer the right amount of enjoyment and content for the money it's asking for. RATING: 8.5/10  Follow our curator page, Alexander's Club Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one. 
IMCNDN818	Not Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007307870/	Oh Ubisoft, you foolishly made me think you were tunring over a new leaf.  The last few years I even started to support you because you were doing better.  But alas here we are.  The game is fantastic.  I love the setting, SOME of the characters, and the gameplay is fun to me (except naval combat isn't nearly as fun as it was in black flag IMO).  BUT, and this is a big but and i cannot lie, The microtransactions are disgusting.  You WILL hit an XP wall even if you say "Oh ok I just won't buy the bonus xp" and this WILL distroy the fun you were having up until that point.  Where you either need to grind and grind and grind for hours just to be able to play the next story quest oooooor F*** you give me money.  Thems the brakes.  I'll change this review if they patch that but I doubt they will.
Kallian	Recommended	44.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alcarondras/	Witcher's Creed: Shadow of SpartaThis game doesn't even try to hide what it references. Which is totally cool with me! Not a traditional Assassin's Creed game but it's immersive, enjoyable, and fun- all that matters to me at the end of the day.
Makam	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Makamm/	NO, I haven't played any other game from the same series.YES, I am Greek so I guess this played its part too.No, I haven't finished it but I have played enough to see its gameplay.AND YES, this game is really good.For the experienced players, there is not much to add. Familiar mechanics, a bit improved as usual over last game, in a new setting. For the new ones like me, I was really pleasantly surprised. I am not a big fan of the yearly series but this game is solid fun. Great graphics although a bit heavy for my PC (Intel 2500k, GPU AMD 480, 8GB, average 30-50 FPS all maxed) with many options to lower the aspects you want to sacrifice for more FPS, great sound and music, especially the random voices which are in ancient Greek. Too bad these can be enjoyed only by Greeks and philhellenes because they improve the immersion greatly.But best of all ingredients is the atmosphere. If you liked the movie "300" you will love this too. The game even begins with you as Leonidas in the tutorial. I was impressed by all the historical information you get as well and I don't mean just the text. Everyday life, clothes, names, myths, it's like all school history books from that era came to life. Great work indeed.The game really feels and plays like you are in the middle of Ancient Greece, Hellas to be precise, during its glorious but troubling past. If you like our ancient culture, buying and playing it is a great gift to yourselves. If not, well you can still get it in a couple of years, as I read that there will be no Creed game next year, during a sale as it's a great game nevertheless.Hu-ah!
CubanWT	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cubanwill/	I was so hyped up for this game that I even pre-ordered it, which is something I don't usually do. When I went to launch it on the release day, it kept crashing after all of the company logos played on a computer that I know can easily run it, which meant that I didn't even get to see the AC title screen. The issue is that this game, like many other Ubisoft games, REQUIRES A CPU THAT SUPPORTS AVX. Since there are so many good cpus out there that don't support AVX and since so many people are having this issue, hopefully Ubisoft will release a patch that makes the game support other CPUs, like they've done with games like AC: Origins and The Crew 2. Until Then, I can't recommend this game.
Dark Instinct	Not Recommended	33.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkinstinct/	This game is MASSIVE and it is actually better than AC: Origin which was also fantastic gameplay wise but man does it hurt seeing how overboard they have gone with microtransactions, I payed 120$ and still feel like I need to spend at least another 50$ to truly enjoy this game the way it was meant to be played by the devs, the game is not balanced to be best enjoyed without buying "time savers" and no matter how amazing the game is, this is going to be the death of AC as a series if they don't ease off on the extreme level of greed on display at every turn in this game.This game is far from being bad, it is a great game but it constantly pushes you toward spending money. Upgrading items costs resources, upgrading your ship costs resources and at no time does it ever feel good to be in a shop looking at your choices when you know that this choice wouldn't exist if you payed more money. Being able to pay for something undermines any purpose the resources have by boiling them all down to "you could farm this stuff but we would really rather you just pay us more" because no matter how much they give you during play you still know that it was all put into the game with the intent of giving you something you could spend real money on. If you couldn't buy them then it would make said resources and levels you gain feel purposful, if you ever want to prove this point to yourself simply imagine your favorite games with a similar cash store being added in, imagine any final fantasy game where you could buy EXP or cash boosts, imagine Pacman if you could get a 2xpoints boost for 1.99$ and how that would literally make everything you do feel undermined.

Thardoz	Not Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/indesin/	Bought the ultimate edition prior to release and feel cheated and ripped off. The listed product specifications and expectations from experiences with Far Cry 5 and Ghost Recon: Wildlands and even Assassins Creed: Origins made me believe my PC could run AC:Odyssey as well. I was willing to take a performance hit.However: AC:Odyssey buggers out w/o error message past the Epilepsy warning. Only after sifting through the support forums I found out that AC:Odyssey REQUIRES the Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) and will not run on first generation i5 or i7 CPUs and a few others. The game does NOT EVEN mention that the CPU is not supported, nor does it give ANY error message at all. Ain´t that cute?This dishonest, cheaty and abominally false advertising of Ubisoft will make sure that this was the last Ubisoft product I ever purchased.
Kellock93	Not Recommended	26.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031303754/	Well, what should I say ? I love this game and hate it at the same time. The world and style are gorgeous, for all I care I could simply spend my time by exploring acient Greece and all of its wonders. Well at least if the gameplay itself wasn't so iffy. Even if you ignore the balance issues and bad game design choices .... well it simply feels like you are playing a loot simulator. Only to notice later ... all the loot you are getting is absolutely usless 2 levels later, even if it is legendary gear. Well I could ignore all this and still have fun in this game, because after all the main story plot is decent and there are some hidden quest gems here and there that gave me a good chuckle. The thing that really turned the tide for me is the AI, it is so stupid that one might think it got imported straight from a 10-15 year old game. A guard NPC stands in the middle of a fortress with blood and corpses all around it, all of the sudden it's fellow guard dies from an arrow to the head standing less than half a meter away ... who cares right ? No need to sound the alarm or anything ... So what to say, is this a horrible game ? No. Is it worth 50 bucks ? Hell no. This game could have been awsome but unfotunatley it became barely medicore. If you are interested in sightseeing acient Greek or a die hard Assasins Creed Fan you can buy it, but I would always wait for a discount. You will need some money for the microtransactions anyway ;)
Tuna	Not Recommended	0.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972192984/	Absolute garbage that Ubisoft CHANGED the requirements 2 days before release because they forgot to tell us that the game requires AVX capable processors. Origins had no such requirement, and ran fine on non-AVX processors. 2 of their previous games also had this issue, and it was fixed with a patch. This time? Ubi says they have no plans to patch. 100% refund.EDIT: Leaving original review as is so you can see it. Ubisoft has suggested that they are working to posibly patch AVX support. I would like them to explain why their official response on release was "we are not planning any patch for AVX". Did they really think people would not be angry? Anyways, if they patch AVX i will change the review.For those who say its my fault for having an old computer, you are right, i cant afford to upgrade. Realize that upgrading a 1st gen i5 means a new mobo, ram, and probably case. Ive looked into it its about $500 CAN. My comp ran Origins and many other recent games perfectly fine, so I am right to assume that it will run Odyssey fine. Its still on Ubi for not telling us when they ran into the same issue on release of  Crew 2.
Farjam the LuckyNoob	Recommended	55.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/farjam/	I was never fan of older AC games (except black flag), this is why i love Origins and Odyssey. I remember people have infested forums with comments like "oh no AC is too much repetitive , no new element no new game-play , AC games are exactly like each other". now they gave us something new (origin and odyssey) and suddenly those exact people became hardcore fan of expired/repetitive/no-innovation AC Games and crying about too much changes that happened to the series.no hidden blade ? no problem, origins and odyssey are about the first ones and maybe they didn't have that thing before they formed their group , you know they don't usually born with a hidden blade in their asses.* keep calm and kill the big bad wolf
purplepoodle	Recommended	51.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005582955/	By far the most beautiful game I've ever played. The Combat is simple but highly satisfying. I love the feel of the open world and exploration mode is so great. I realize now that that was probably what was killing the immersion for me in the last games and making me tire of them quickly... too many quest markers everywhere; this makes it feel like an adventure again and actually keeps things interesting because you have to actually explore. I'm glad I bought it it's worth every penny even  at the ultimate price I have no regrets and over 50 hours played in only 4 days. 
AjS	Not Recommended	9.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048141955/	Microtransactions in this game are the worst i have seen.

Now countless people are out because ubi decided to use AVX. How can every other AAA title be played on my pc in high to ultra settings yet no ac od? This was very decpective business practices utilized by UBISOFT. Wait until all the pre orders come in then change your specs? Beyond Deceptive shame on you ubisoft.

Saibot	Recommended	35.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S41B0T/	Improving on the already masterfully made Origins by adding even more RPG elements like armour pieces and ability mapping as well as the much loved open seas sailing. If you loved Origins then this is a no-brainer must buy. If you liked Origins, but felt the RPG elements maybe weren't fleshed out enough than this is again a must buy. If you don't plan on playing this or you just haven't played the series since the Ezio trilogy than you've already given this a 0/10, but when you finally grow up and decide to think for yourself, then this game is more than worth your time Funny how a lot of the negative reviews are based on 1-2 hours of playing the game. I am 20 hours in at the moment and while it is true that the original feeling of AC is no longer there it does bring something new and it is an Open world RPG. If you cannot accept that then you should have known based on Origins that this game was not going to be for you.The game itself is great and offers a lot of features that make the world feel alive.Easily you can spent 100+ hours into this game without ever being bored.For me this game is a 10/10 because I know that I will get every penny out of it and enjoy it. Ubisoft has done an amazing job and I advice everyone that loves RPG's to try this out.PLUS it comes with the Season pass- LEGACY OF THE FIRST BLADE: Fight alongside the legend who first wielded the Hidden Blade to change the course of history.- THE FATE OF ATLANTIS: Confront godly creatures and uncover the secrets of the legendary sunken city. - AC 3 REMASTERED- AC Liberation REMASTEREDLike bro.

Crisis	Not Recommended	14.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007330588/	First off the game looks and feels great at first you will have also a lot of fun.But it gets rather dull really fast. after the first island you will notice it that you can't assanate some of the characters.it will just do a ton of damage, after they will call their friends and bye bye stealth aproach.The game also has a leveling system in place, but I soon realised that it's completley pointless, just to make sure you don'tgo to the higher level places first. if you level to high for a reagon the enemies will level with you. Theses things all combined made this for me a naggitive expierence.The story is okay and I like the fact you can play as both male or female. and they are fully voice acted.I did not like the mordren world parts, in all honesty I wish they had removed that all. it's boring and not fun to play.I am not 100% sure about the choices they feel more like to change up the dialog but not the story that much.From what I have seen so far. This game also has optional Microtransactions, they are not a must yet but I wonder... Just don't support that kind of thing, Overall I think this game might be a fun game to play if you can get over the negitives. But not at full price. buy it on sale is my advice. or atleast wait for more reviews.

Korkrag	Recommended	40.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035826989/	Like Assassins Creed Origins, except much much bigger, and you have ships! Black flag was awesome, upgradeable ships are back, Yay! I will upgrade my archers, and upgrade my spears.... and then not use either as I ram people to death!I personally don't mind playing games with weak graphics. So bad graphics wouldn't bother me... That said, this game has amazing graphics. I had to turn them down for fear of being sucked back in time through my magic picture device. Okay... so it doesn't look that real... but it does look damn good!At time of writing this review, I'm only around 30 hours in. (28.8) But it's my second day, gimme a break. I've done loads of the game already, and it just keeps revealing more stuff I can do. On top of that, there are repeatable quests (Which are voiced, of course. Unlike... some lesser games...) Huge areas to explore. I did a side quest, a little quest in the middle of nowhere. It wound up splitting into three other quests, which went on to more quests. As I freed slaves, got a family killed, and kicked a guy off a mountain. It was all good.... Except for the family.... Oh well. I love this game. It's great. I'd like to say though, to anyone complaining about the cash shop, don't buy anything, that way you won't lose any money, makes sense, right?Not like you're losing out on much, the game is HUGE, MASSIVE! MASSIVELY HUGE! HASSIVELY MUGE!... Wait, those aren't words.The microtransactions aren't very useful either. Sure, you can buy in game currency... or you can ram down a few ships with your boat and become rich in a few minutes. I know what I'd choose. Microtransactions are there for people who have money and don't like having fun. Pay no mind to them. Except the Pegasus... buy the Hell..... No.... Hades outta that.Well, I think that's all I can type, if this doesn't make sense, well, I'm tired, thirsty and my Cthulhu plushy is looking right at me, which is scaring me. :sadcthulhu: So, Buy the game, give it a go, Don't wait for it to go on sale, buy it now! You won't regret it... and if you do, don't blame me, blame the Spartans.
Auron Soudai	Not Recommended	7.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197985634075/	I'll keep this as simple and straight forward as possible.Pros:- Conversation choices are great. Plenty of humour as well.- Graphics are gorgeous.- The photo mode allows for great things.- Great for pro gamers.Cons:- Looting choices are contradictory. You make choices in conversations that are good, yet half of the loot items are restricted behind "Steal". This means you have to do bad things to get everything. Many special chests etc are listed as steal instead of loot. In other words, to get anywhere, you have to be a bad person. I thought Assassins are meant to be good guys in these games??- Another failure in the game is the levelling system. When I started I saw sidequests and Main missions listed as level 2 recommendation. When I hit level 3, those same missions jumped to match my level. The same goes with enemies. Despite playing on the easiest difficulty (I prefer to play for story than challenge) that I would come across a tough enemy. For example, I was at level 3 and came across a group of enemies at level 3. I couldn't beat them due to the combat system/controls, so I thought that I would leave and level up. So I reached level 4 and returned to them. However, those enemies are now at level 4. This contradicts the difficulty settings.- Not good for casual gamers.If you're a pro gamer that can handle the flaws in the game, then that's good. If you're a casual gamer like me, then it's not so good.I will try to continue playing this game, but I am preferring the previous games.
Ocelot	Recommended	20.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082610824/	I'll get the elephant out of the room...the performance is just awful. Very dissapointing, the engine is really starting to show it's age not to mention the multiple layers of DRM. I really hope this is addressed in the very near future, as it's quite a damp on an otherwise good game.Moving on-This iteration of Assassin's Creed brings many new gameplay features like conquering areas and their leaders (kinda feels like something out of the middle earth series) as well as an all new dialogue/choice system that has real consequences that will last for the remainder of the game. One of my favourite parts of the new game is the awesome sailing and naval combat, you can upgrade ship and crew in many ways. I don't really like the "romance" system as it's always just some black screen :/ There's lots of RPG skill trees and more to upgrade your character, lot's of different armours and weapons allow deep customisation. Plus you have the choice of male or female character to play. Despite the performance issues and a couple of bugs I've come across this is a solid open world game that I'm really enjoying, and with all the post launch content planned I may be playing this one for a while to come.

Echo's of Skyrim/Oblivion.However. Severely marred by AC's ATROCIOUS LEVELLING!!!  Why oh why do they stíll insíst on taking all the fun out by nerfing the player in any way possible. 1 or two levels above You? Good luck. Die a lot. 3 levels? Completely impossible.Wouldn't be a big problem...... If the levelling went at a good pace. Well. It doesn't. Grind, grind, grind aaand some more grinding. At a snails'pace.Ugh. Well. Luckily they ported it quite well. On a GTX1080 and a i7 5820 with 32gig RAM It runs between 45 and 60 fps on 2:1 widescreen @ 3440x1440 with settings on ultra. Not bad.Oh, and not unimportant: They fixed saving. There's an actual 'quick save' now.But.. Grdmnt! Ubi.. If I wanted a grind-fest, I'd start-up some Korean RPG.Shame on me, thinking it would be different this time.This seems to be the way to sneaky force players with a bit less time, say, by having a job.. (THAT PAYS FOR THIS GAME) or a family-life, into micro transactions?So, no reccomend from me. Micro-transactions should die, die, die. And the beancounters forcing it on the players should all be fired.. or flogged.
ONISAIBOT	Not Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ONISAIBOT/	The only thing, that's still Assassin's Creed about this, is the name.Oh and expect treatment with an all new cash shop, that will render any F2P MMO envious:- Fantasy Mounts- Armor Skins- Ship Skins- Weapon Skins- And most certainly more bs still to come.The menus look copy pasted from No Man's Sky, which were copy pasted from Destiny, if you didn't know.The dialogue interfaces look copy pasted from The Witcher 3.The characters and story seem uninspired and boring. The main thing that kept me interested in the series, were the parts that played during our present time, yes i said it, now flail me alive. Unfortunately, this part seems to grow ever lacking for each consecutive title that's thrown out of this machinery. Exploration of the second side quest, cave, or outpost felt more like a drag, than climbing the 500th tower in AC2, despite the 'new' movement and combat system.Really disappointed with this one and seriously doubt, that i will finish this game anytime soon, until then, stay away from it, unless you're a die-hard 300 fan, cause that seems to be the audience, this generic hack'n'slash title seems to be catered towards.
UnsaFest Bro	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/UnsaFestBro/	Easily the best assassin's creed game in the franchise. But it's from Ubisoft so expect some Ubisoft special features like an ingame store filled with micro transaction. They've designed the game in such a way that you'll have to grind your way only to play the main missions or pay 10usd for a permanent xp boost. And you grind by playing countless amount of sh*tty sidequests which are not fun whatsoever. The story and the missions are great but good luck grinding.This game is worth at full price but needs optimization as the game is notorious to lag in the cities. PSA: Don't buy anything from the in-game store.

benoitrigg22	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pleasekillmeihatemylife1/	Without the microtransactions and really annoying in-game grind, I would consider this around Witcher 3 level (which is the only game I've given an 11/10). However, Ubisoft is full of greedy bastards who want to squeeze every cent of money out of their dwindling fanbase. They made purposely made this game really grindy just so they could add "xp boosts" for REAL LIFE MONEY to speed up the grinding process. It's pretty pathetic honestly. I paid $120 for the game, and I would still have to pay with more money for xp boosts if I want to skip the grind. I am honestly sick of games doing this, especially SINGLE PLAYER GAMES! THERE'S NOT EVEN ANY POINT!!!Aside from that, this is still a VERY good game underneath those cons. Much better than Origins and probably the best AC game since Black Flag. Gameplay = good, combat = awesome, graphics = stunning, story = captivating. And naval battles are more fun than ever before. All in all great game, and I would have considered it even better had Ubisoft not added ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t microtransactions.8.7/10

Panda	Recommended	59.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/4Pandaz40K/	Worth it! As you can see, I've racked up over 50 Hours so far and I can tell you this game is worth 60$. The graphics have been tweaked but are similar to Origins, the interface is also similar with some upgrades. The story is great and funny, the choice system is amazing and lets you pick what you do and dont want to do in situations. Only thing I dont like is that they killed someone I like not saying any names :). The Sea gameplay is interesting and fun. Anyways the cult is very fascinating having to find clues and hunt them down. Mercenaries are annoying but a good challenge especially on Hard. I played as Kassandra and shes just a badass anyways I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys Action Adventure games. If you loved Assassins Creed III like me you can buy the Gold Edition and you'll get the remastered version free.
God of War	Recommended	41.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GodofGamers/	This is definitely an Assassin's Creed game that completes what Origins lacked.

Princess Milky	Recommended	32.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PrincessMilky/	Assassin's Creed Odyssey brings new life to the series.I personally started the series with AC3. Played Black Flag and then Unity. Didn't play again till Origins but only played like an hour of it... where Origins lacked, Odyssey has picked up. The game is beautiful, the map huge, the story intriguing. I am emotionally invested in the story of Kassandra (the character I picked). It runs beautifully for me, there is so much to see and do, and every quest doesn't feel as though you're just fetching and doing boring stuff. They all feel grand and the main story has a lot of twists thus far for me. I am 21 hours in (had early play with the gold edition) and I am not even close to being done. The game is MEANT to be played in Exploration Mode. Doing so insures you have a magical experience. 10/10 Assassin's Creed game in my opinion.

Meanwhile, my computer fans are running like an airplane engine and my GPU is hotter than usual.With the settings I have, the environment looks like utter trash. The textures are worse than games from the 90s.Now, even if the game ran well, I still wouldn't recommend it.The character animations and facial animations are stilted and awkward. Something I'd expect from an indie game, not a AAA Ubisoft title. Comparatively, I've been playing Kingdom Come and the animations there are lightyears better. And it's from a small independent studio!On top of that, the voices and dialog are garbage. Even the main character has a cheesy accent and reads her lines almost monotone. Not that the lines are any good, anyway.I don't have anything to say about the game play, mainly because I haven't played an AC game since the first one and I haven't gotten very far yet.But my initial impressions of the game's presentation are that bad that I felt the need to write something right away.Also it's worth noting that for the female MC, they basically just swapped the gender and used the same animations and writting as the male MC.I think I might refund this.

CasperTheGhostx	Not Recommended	13.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055516409/	I'll start with the pros:- Graphics are good (nothing amazing, but good).- Characters are likeable and their voice acting is generally good- Story is engaging- Naval combat is back and funBut the cons just kill the game for me:- "Time Saver" microtransactions. They're not even trying to hide the fact that they're going for a quick cash-grab anymore.- Combat just feels broken. Time to kill is absolutely rediculous. Player does basically no damage to enemies the same level as them with the same level gear, but enemies do massive damage to player. And that's on normal difficulty.- Assassinations aren't guaranteed instant kills for enemies of the same level, defeating the purpose of spending time sneaking up on a target. - Leveling is slow, unlike Origins. Origins almost felt like leveling was too fast, but Odyssey feels way too slow. Constantly feeling underpowered.- Performance is quite poor. My overclocked 4790K and 1080TI (in a custom watercooling loop) can barely maintain 60 FPS at 1440p in populated areas on a mix of High and Ultra settings. CPU gets really hot (over 65C), which I attribute to the DRM, just like in Origins.Most of my dismay lies with the combat system. I don't buy an AC game to play as a tank character, but that's basically the build you have to make to survive combat in this game. With enemies being as tanky as they are, blatant cash-grab microtransactions, and poor level pacing I really can't recommend the game. Its a shame because the story seems really good so far compared to the last few games, but being unable to make it through combat with enemies the same level as you makes it incredibly frustrating to make any story progress.

About the optimisation, no worries, ubisoft aware of it im sure and they are working on it, as this is just a 1st day of a launch, every day passes the improvments we will see same as with origins did.There is still many content remaining to see in oddysey, for a season pass.To make your game playable, just tweaks some settings here and there, to low such as clouds, you will get boost in performance.

And got sad depressed, i have no money to buy new build as of now, so i thought to uninstall it and let it play once i upgraded my Pc for better stable gameplay.But today morning, as i cannot stay like that as a fan of series lol, i again install it today and im playing fine with between 30 to 60fps and im happy for that. Game is very enjoyable, there is many side quests, exploration, you can say more polished and more improvements towards origins.#Everryyybody gets benefits my friend, markos.Kassandra <3

Numenorean	Not Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967524117/	Let's start with the obvious: the game is fun, and the story is the mediocre AC style story.  Grinding and micro transactions are also part of the game, exactly like SW Battlefront 2; but let's start from the beginning.Most of the assets has been lifted from Origin; which is neither a good or a bad thing. Performances are mediocre; and considering what you see on screen, and comparing it to other AAA games like the Witcher, runs pretty well. Better than Origin for sure, so that is a win.The choice between the 2 characters has no meaningful reason to exist. Beside the fact that in Sparta there were no women that would fight or wear armor, and not all the men were stereotype of the caveman; you are left with the same exact story; minus some differences here and there in the dialogues. Even the animations are mostly recycled; which is ridiculous, espoecially if you play as Cassandra and lift a woman in a romance scene, exactly like Alexios did. I was hoping for 2 different point of views and some differences in the story; but forget about it. So play with whatever character you like; they are both obnoxious and caricature of real people.On the contrary, the other NPC are well done, you care about them and get a connection instantly. Voice over is nicely done, altough the accent seems to disappear at times. I just wonder why don't they just speak English  (or allow to pick whatever voiceover track you like), and leave NPC speaking ancient Greek, except when they interact with you. Makes no sense to hear someone from ancinent Greece, speak in English with a Greek accent; but this is what we have.Gameplay is fun; although, it won't last too long. You have a huge map but the activities to perform are fundamentally variation of the same 4 activities. Like in Origin, if you don't like repetitive gameplay, this won't make you change your mind.Combat is fun and mostly arcade; once you get few skills that are quite powerful, you will mow tons of adversaries easily. Until you hit the level wall.Yes, this game has micro transactions; as such; the grind is implemented as form of frustration for the player. It is not a game that has X difficulty, and linear progression, and micro transaction offer you the chance to non-play the game (because some people buy games to finish them ASAP, not to enjoy them, but that's their choice). Here the grind is set on purpose; you can't pass  levels beyond 14; without an insane amount of grind, doing over and over the same 4 activities.But of course, you can buy boosts, to solve the problem; so on top of the 100 bucks to buy the high tier version of the game, you need to pay another 20-40 bucks for boosters; unless you want to spend between 4-10 hours grinding for materials, money and XP to finally pass the wall and finish the last few campaign missions.Don't get me wrong, the game is fun; but it is fun for a limited amount of time. Then it gets tedious and boring; and unless you live to play these games, and are brainwashed by the current AAA companies that release games made to frustrate players on purpose, to then make extra cash; then you will put the game down once you reach that level wall, and probably won't touch it anymore.So, for that, I can't recommend this game; but I can say if you get it for 50-60 % off, then get it. Origin like Odissey, is not worth more than 20-30 dollars; unless they start to think that people would gladly buy extras and expansions if the game would let you progress linearly, like it used to be in the times before micro transactions.

Seriously why even do this? What other gaming companys go through all this trouble for a single player game that you cant be hacked in? Not even going to get into the fact that you thought microtransactions in a SINGLE player game would be a good idea just shows how money hungry you are overall.

Plan of Action-HGf	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Plan_Of_Action/	Do not buy if your CPU does not support AVX (Intel 1st gen).  The game will not run.Ubisoft has not said anything about a patch to resolve this yet.
ChrisJohnBlack	Recommended	45.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChrisJohnBlack/	Okay so I decided to write this review ahead of time because of all the negative reviews popping up on steam lately. I honestly don't know what to say. I expected the same microtransactions as Origins, and for it to be just as unnecessary for me, and I was correct. I didn't care and I never was tempted. I go onto Steam expecting a high rating, and no. This game deserves more I believe. TLDR: This game is great. It has a few performance issues and hiccups, but this game is truly an amazing experience. Don't give up on this series just yet. It has only just found it's new legs. This game truly changed what AC was in the same way AC 2 did back when it was released. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite game in the franchise. Hands down.LONG VERSION:Firstly I'd like to get all the negative things mentioned out of the way.1 - Optimization: This game runs better on my PC than Origins does on the same build and settings. I believe they took the optimization problems from Origins, and improved upon it, but yes, there are times when it dips into the 30's on a GTX 1080Ti at 1080p. By no means is this good, but just the fact that there are no more stuttering cutscenes has already pushed this game beyond Origins in this field, IMHO.2 - Microtrasactions:Are there Microtransactions? Yes, there are. Are they necessary? NOO!! I have to say, after putting over 30+ hours into this game I have not felt pressured to use the Microtransactions, once! I guess it really is made for players to have a choice over how they want to play. If you want to get to the high levels of the map without completing side quests and exploring the MULTITUDE of different locations throughout the world, then good luck, cuz like any RPG this game is meant to build up your character and explore. You want a shortcut through that, you're gonna want Microtransactions. I, for one, by just following the story and exploring, have had no desire whatsover to pay for any Microtransactions. My character is constantly at a high enough level and I have 4000+ resources to use on upgrading gear, though I usually just use new gear as they come just because of how diverse and beautiful they are. They even made the Ship's most demanding piece of resource mostly available from naval combat.3 - Side Missions:This game's Side Missions are split into 3 main categories: Story Side Missions, Timed Side Missions, and Bounties. The Story Side Missions are incredible, Witcher 3 quality side missions, with decisions and consequences where one choice of mine actually affected an entire area in the game. The Timed Side Missions and Bounties are all timed missions where no story or choices are implemented. They're your basic go-there-get-that missions and they are for grinding (for those who prefer to do so). I completely ignore the notice board (where all the timed missions and bounties are) and I just do some of the timed missions that pop-up in the game world. It's more immersive, the grind is okay, and even some of the timed missions have a mini story (like a woman wanting me to deliver a witch some herbs so she would stop coming to their property naked at night to pick them while dancing naked because her husband likes to watch lol)Now for the rest of this, guys.4 - Story:This is incredible so far. I'm having a blast and honestly it's so refreshing and new to have choices and dialogue options. I don't want to spoil anything so yeah. Love this game's story.5 - Gameplay:People keep saying it's a lot like Origins. There are similarities in my opinion, but this game has so many different abilities and skills that change the gameplay SOO MUCH! And if you loved Black Flag, well there's ton of ship combat here, but again, completely unique and suited to the setting and time period. I LOVE how this game handles combat and abilities, and I'm having a blast going through every location scattered around ancient Greece.This game truly changed what AC was in the same way AC 2 did back when it was released. I can honestly say without a doubt that this is my favorite game in the franchise. Hands down.
Cromium	Not Recommended	1.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006715661/	This game has become so unoriginal, same old AC game with new skins, and your adding a grind wall @lvl 16 and start selling exp boost? lolTechnically its fine, but ethically its not.Your not taking my money.
Echoic	Not Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977649322/	They ruined the combat in this series with MMO-like stat grinding.  Seems like a disasterous choice.  Maybe it allowed them to further monetize the game with those little UPlay upgrades and stat boosts.

BLOOD & HONOR "(GR)" 4K	Recommended	39.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/romanos2314/	This Assassin's Creed game if the first who have question so it is some kind of RPG because all the choises are no matter.There are not side and main quests only quests many quests toooooo many quests!!!Of course there is a storyline but is not have main effect at the questsThe graphics are stuning at 4K but again no SLI support F..k you Ubisoft about it. Of course I try it at 1080p and it is the game with the most great graphics at 1920X1080.One new spec is at the icons of skinsmiths are not appeared (you must find them and remember where they are) and you have the choice to change one spec of your weapon e.g. from 4% crit hit to go to + 8% life the same at the armors. When you level up the specs are leveling up a 5 level player has +4% life a player who is 30 level has +8% life choise.But al least is runs smoth at 30 FPS ONLY GRRRRR !!!! Great job for single GPU game but SLI is always SLI and if it supported i may play the game at 60 FPS like Far Cry 5 I hope this year Nvidia inspector find the Dual GPU gamers a resolve.The gameplay is almost the same with Origins but you cannot hold shield only weapons.I will update this review when I play more hours the game.
Диана	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vcramps/	cool stabby stabby video game, would recomend
Entar	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Entar/	With a 5Ghz i7 8700k and a 1080 with med settings I am averaging about 50 FPS, so suffice to say the optimization is terrible.Laid out very similarly to Witcher 3, though the combat is much more fun and varied here.  The game itself is excellent so far and I'd reccomend it, though if your hardware isn't on the higher end you may want to wait for the inevitable performance patches.Microtransactions included in a single-player game are a little cringeworthy to me; to the game's credit however they're totally voluntary, and don't seem to hamper the core experience at all if ignored.
Blink	Not Recommended	14.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198258117441/	i dont know and cant find a solution for crashing it crashes so bad after 10+15 mins of the game and my specs i have i7 8th gen processor and 1060 6gb it still crash iam so damn triggered
JumpinGopher	Recommended	47.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JumpinGopher/	Assassin's Creed without Assassins or Templars, only thing tying the series name to this game is Pieces of Eden and a terrible modern day story that picks up from the comics that I just learned existed with characters I don't care about. However I did enjoy the game more then I dislike it. Gameplay is similar to Origins but your a Spartan without a shield, graphics are overall good but with medicore performance, ship stuff is fun, and exploring ancient Greece is enjoyable.
Jared	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198202720888/	The setting is great. Progression system seems okay. Combat is fun and many abilities to choose from. If you liked AC Origins you'll like this game.
vinnygunnz	Recommended	27.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030491290/	This is one of the best games I have played so far.  It takes you on a journey, an odyssey if you will, that engages you with action and heartfelt moments.  I am playing the Kassandra protagonist, and her voice acting combined with the motion capture that animates her gestures and facial expressions breathes life into a game character that elevates the experience to new heights.Graphically the game is beautiful, and the performance on an I7 7700k GTX 1070 with 16gb of memory at 2k has been around 50 t0 55 fps at Ultra High settings with adaptive vsynch turned on.  I feel like this game is a masterpiece that gamers will be talking about for some time.
FARA	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Firlandi/	Fun. Just some optimization issues.
Ziney	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Firedude123/	Love it so much to do
lonigus	Recommended	20.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198089921345/	Summary after 11 hours:- Glitched under map once- Smoke from campfires tends to visually glitch out- had 3 crashes- don't ALT+TAB while loading into game (this caused two of the three crashes)- some conversations are cheesy as hell- some side missions are still totally useless and boring- sometimes weird behavior from animals and enemy people fighting you.So far the experience has been okay. It's Origins, but better in all aspects. If you liked Origins, then this is a must buy. 8.5/10 from me at this point.PS: The PC optimalization could have been better to be honest. Sometimes (very rarely tho) I get dips below 30 while having 60-80 stable FPS on ultra/max settings 1080p with a 1070. When I went to 2k resolution, the benchmark went from 50-80 at 1080p to 24 !!!! - 45 fps. Thats a HUGE difference and it shouldnt be that bad (with even some settings toned down and by far not at max settings) If you want to use 2k resolution at the fullest, then have atleast a 1080 with a good CPU since this game also eats a decent chunk of your CPU.
parco1385	Recommended	19.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259170127/	Just finish the main story . Its great!
☠FUCKING WINDOWS 98☠	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Armeggeda/	300 Simulator the game.So far the game is pretty fun, the combat is simple and easy once you get use to dodging, blocking and spamming the THIS IS SPARTA! Kick. (killing higher level enemies, such as mercenaries is a meme once you figure out the mechanics) The stealth aspect of the game is pretty simplistic as well, albiet cheesey but this isnt the old school Splinter Cell games.The world is fantastic and very beutifull. Full of things to explore, side quests and wolfs that want to murder you for looking at them the wrong way.The dialogue can be hit or miss with certain NPC's, some characters feel very rushed while others are quit entertaining and have good dialogue. So far the character you play as (I chose kassandra) is very witty and has some very decent dialogue no matter who I interacted with.The one thing I do very much like about this game is you that you can turn off quest markers, allowing you to explore more. Should you ever get lost you can easily turn the markers back on but the hints NPC's give you is usually enough to go off of.All in all i'd recommend this game, even for people who havent played AC before (this is the first one I've played since the AC3) as it keeps you entertained and is enjoyable from the get-go.
SlaveDeMorto	Not Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/slavedemorto/	First of all: game most likely won't run for you unless you install it to disk C which is an "amazing" feature from an AAA company.TL;DR: Shadow of Mordor (or Shadow of War) for the rich kids. Game borrows so many original ideas from Mordor at this point it is getting ridiculous. Yet tendency was even at previous game, Origins, so it's not the breaking news. I'd say wait for the sale to buy it.Graphics and Optimization: ... it is a hard topic, while the game is able to pull off the overall better image then Origins it is as well 5-10 times more demanding then the former and is 20 times worse optimized. The game is ridiculously CPU heavy as well. I have gtx 1080 and Ryzen 7 1700 and I am able to run this game onl at medium-low settings at 1440p WITH STUTTERING. And it is with environment detail set to low out of all things. On the other hand Origins was running on High perfectly fine (when it wasn't crashing). I mean why can I play newest Tomb Raider at ULTRA settings with silky smooth 60 fps while I am bound to have lag spikes in Odyssey if they were released almost at the same time. All that said image is more colorful then ever before. Speaking of CPU load by the way. It is the only game that ever used that much of my CPU. No game I played before be it a breathtakingly beautiful FF15 or anything else, consumed that much. With Vsync off the game runs at 35% cpu load but if I turn the Vsync on to get rid of constant screen tearing it goes up to 80-90% CPU load. And that mind you with low environmental detail and any other CPU heavy task set to low. Also my GTX 1080 seem to be at constant 90% load while only using about 2gb of video memory out of the 8. So looking back at Tomb Raider that was released not so long ago and at this I think the optimization is pretty horrible.Gameplay: Basically Origins, but a bit better with a bit more refined gameplay elements. Standard Ubisoft and Assassin Creed game in general. The only HUGE downside is game's pacing. It takes too much time to travel from place to place and not in the fun way. In withcer 3 exploring the world and riding on the roads didn't took long untill something happened and overall was pleasant. In Mordor for example there was a mechanic where if you pressed a button correctly you'd get a huge speed boost after jumping over stuff, so even running felt like a little minigame and overall traveling the world was extra fast and carefree. Even Syndicate had a grappling hook (the downside is that it ruined the climbing mechanics) which made traveling around the world more fun.While Oddysey feels low and sluggish and every time you need to call a horse and travel somewhere for 5 minutes to fart on the chest and another 5 minutes to return is nowhere close to being fun.Music: Amazing. The second strongest part of the game losing only to the aesthetics of it.Lore/Story/Setting: Interesting so far (I'm at prologue). The actual choice of your action occasionally during the quest dialogues is a nice touch and a great step towards an actual RPG. Setting itself is a blast. I loved the 300 movie and the lore behind it as well as other games set in the same time period, so Odyssey feels really fun. It is a bit less breathtaking (at least for now in prologue) compared to the Origins and Egypt, yet it still feels massive and fun to explore.Misk: THANK GOD DEVELOPERS ADDED MORE THAN ONE LAME STEALTH KILL ANIMATION THEY HAD IN ORIGINS. like really it shouldn't be a thing to be happy about because it is basic stuff, yet unlike Origins that had literally 1 stealth kill animation, this game has various ones which actually look cool. Also in the misk stuff: formerly mountains had a little climbing points that you could see, like any building in the game would, but now you are simply climbing the ugly watered down testures with your hand being stuck inside the rock as character performs the animations of climbing it. Having ingame screenshots pop up all over the ingame map is a horrible concept and it should not exist. It clutters the map and sometimes blocks you from placing markers or using fast trevel.Microtransactions: I only saw them when I accidentally hit the wrong button on the controller and ended up in the ingame shop. So I say Ubisoft can sell anything they want in game be it skins, exp boosts or whatnot if it is that subtle.

crtunematt	Not Recommended	53.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/crtunematt/	So much to do that isn't boring. The story is good...though it takes a bit to build up. But I haven't finished the game because it's a litteral bug/glitch fest. It freezes constantly, my FPS drops like crazy for no apparent reason (doesn't matter what graphics settings I have it on). It's almost unplayable at the point that I'm at. I'm not gonna play it again until they patch this game.

Feeding 101	Recommended	22.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198124263285/	New Assassin's Creed in the making.. i love the vast open world where i can journey and lost, and die because the enemy is far above my level, it's part of the fun. new kind of approach where you can choose your character is great, i hope in the future, you can not only choose your gender, but also customize them. Microtransaction? it's an option.. i mean if you want to looks good, you have to pay more, no? i dont care about permanent bonus xp bonus or time saver pack or something, there's always a back door for it that you can get it for free. so i dont think microtransaction in this game reach the point of annoying.
Khalreon	Recommended	28.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/khalreon/	Excellent Game. Stunning graphics.I have this behaviour when i meet with a good game; Play it till i am sleepy and struggle to decide if i am gonna continue or go to sleep.This is that kind of game.Environment is absolutely breath-taking.Animations are cool.The story so far is good.Combat is soooo much fun on Insane difficulty. Exploration is cool. You can set it to old school so that it doesn't show where you need to go but gives you some directions through dialogue and hints through task list.10/10

Modin	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978172141/	I have never written a review on steam before, and I have never really thought it was necessary to, but today I do. Pre-ordered Assassin's Creed Odyssey as I noramlly like the games, I have played almost everyone since the first one was released. Today my problem is not with the games, but with Ubisoft. I have been unable to launch the game at all and Ubisoft says it is because my computer does not meet the minimum system requirements, specifically my processor. My computer runs any recent game on the high or even higher settings flawlessly, my video card is also one that they recommend for running the game, but for Assassin's Creed: Odyssey it is not good enough. The question is, what exactly are they using my processor for that mine is insufficient for? Most likely for whatever crazy DRM stuff Ubisoft thinks is needed for their games. It is also crazy to see that Ubisoft added an addendum to Assassin's Creed: Odyssey's PC requirements page since the the pre-launch release for all of the people who pre-ordered the game. Well unfortunately Ubisoft has lost a customer and lost them for life, I sincerely regret all of the money I have spent on their games in the past and will never buy from them again. I highly recommend you all do the same until the big-budget developers stop taking advantage of their fans.

Ⓒⓤⓝⓣ	Not Recommended	21.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LawrenceTabor/	This title had great potential for combat depth. Sadly, for a game that takes play during the conflicts of Sparta and Athens, your character isnt even equipped with a shield. The enemies are all the same as the last 6 titles but now they have some mini bosses that become a bigger damage sponge than the rest of the minion type foes. The enjoyment I recieve from watching all enemies pull bows right out of their asses is something that I can only forget after a long 7 year coma. As well as loading back into a friendly camp only to be met with a mercenary after my head, which leads to an absolutley autistic series of events that end up with the mecenary, 2 wolves, 3 bears, and the entire camp trying to kill me as I run through the woods. Whoever you choose to play as is protrayed as a legend, one that can't equip stupid♥♥♥♥♥gear until they level up. I can forsee that the only thing I'll get out of this game is a worn out Mouse Button 1 because thats all you need to press inbetween rolling and using abilities. The best part is that the game crashes when I unplug the charging cable to my headset lol. I do enjoy playing it because the game itself is beautiful and there arent many titles out there that envelop this unqiue time period, other than Ryse: Son of Rome.P.S. Ubisoft's only explaination for this game is that they fired anyone on the project that had decent ideas on how to make the next good Assassin's Creed title.

shadow xxx95	Recommended	37.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067065030/	10/10. One of the biggest games iv played by far, the best story line AC game iv had played as yet nd iv played them all except them chronicles stories. i get lost in picture mode every time i get the chance to see such beautiful landscapes which is very often and not to mention the abilitys which the chracter obtain in the game are AWSOME! The characteristics of the game is like they took god of war for its roman mythology authetic gods and smashed shadow of war abilitys with playstyle of AC Origins and threw in more RPG mechanics which is making it a fresh style for a AC , but even better they give you the option to play it in origin style mechanic for searching missions or it telling you where they are. Story seems good as of yet and it so far has peaked my interest especiaally when you leve the first island. will give updated review after i finish the game entirely. -- verdict if god of war wasnt released within the last year this would have won game of the year in my opinion! A must play.

Varlus M.D.	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/varlusmd/	Developer changed minimum requirements days before release. If your CPU does not support AVX technology, it won't run and they won't fix it. Check your specs carefully before buying the game.
Low Light	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004914583/	**Do not buy this game unless you are certain your CPU supports AVX - otherwise there is literally no way to launch the game*** NOTE: Ubisoft has indicated they will be working on a patch to address CPUs that do not support AVX * Once I'm able to launch the game, I'll update the review to reflect my experiences.  Apparently Ubisoft's DRM uses AVX, which many older (and some newer) CPUs do not have., which means if your CPU doesn't support it, you cannot launch the game.I'm a proponent of upgrading tech as needed, which I've done with every other element of my PC.  CPU has never been a problem until now, and not because of performance, but because the DRM requires it.  Several other Ubisoft titles have done this and have had the requirement patched out, so it's possbile to make the game accessible, we will just need to see if they decide to.

RednecK.	Recommended	26.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theoutskirts_/	I was skeptical at first but no more, the game is fantastic so far. Not to mention the map is huge and gorgeous with so many things to do, it's definitely worth it!

Jimzy	Recommended	11.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hardpimpin/	real fkn nice
Thoth	Recommended	53.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vectorx96/	 In Progress Review 8/10 easily.This new addition to the series is solid, it falters in a few areas but none of these are a huge detriment the game at all. Recommend playing with Nightmare, Exploration and turning most(all) of the Hud off. The game lives up to its acclaimed genre, an Open World - RPG. Though heavily streamlined and simplified for every audience. I’ve yet to encounter bugs, crashing, or stuttering. I’ve had some frame drops (entering huge cities) and decent length load times. These could be due to my decently old rig or the game. Loading is few and far between so even though its long it’s not a problem. Gameplay 9/10, The game excels here, I've been playing on the Nightmare difficulty and it offers a fair challenge though the situations can be unfair at times, when I get killed I know it’s my lack of skill/planning or bad timing, not the game. That said combat is your typical doge and hit not too much new and no matter how you watch it will look terrible, one simply must play in order to get the full effect.The world is beautiful, and large. At first, I was only following the main quest next thing I knew after 2 hours of f**king around I said to myself “oh I should probably do that”. When I finally decided to look around the map, I was in shock of the sheer amount of areas and sh*t I'd probably have to do in them. Side story’s/missions so far are on par with a game like the Witcher, adding to that its clear the Witcher(3) or similar games are an inspiration in some areas.Characters 7/10, are decent and attempt to be colorful, and unlike the most recent Mass Effect I don’t want my character and others to die a horrible death. While of course face animations and lip sync can be off, but then again, few games master it.Sound 10/10, is excellent. The only bad parts could be voices at times, seeming out of place or just not well done.Bird Simulator 2018 10/10, Literally flew across the map as a bird and took in the beauty.As I’ve said 8/10 so far in my play through. I can’t see myself finishing this game until I’m at least 100 hours in, so decent RPG time. 
Linus	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/datlinus/	Very good first impressions, considerable upgrade from Origins in almost every area. Very demanding game though, for 60 fps stable you'll need a semi modern i7 or Ryzen most likely.Thumbs up, for now.
calladia	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075994662/	I took a chance on buying Odyssey , after buying Origins and having to return it because it just wouldn't work for me.Odyssey works and it looks great so far .
HUSKER222	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/raay18/	So far im sucked into the story! They did an amazing job with this game. I didnt like origins to much. I felt the combat was clunky but they definitely built off of what they did in origins and made it so much better. Also the decision making that changed the narrative of the story was a nice touch. Keep it up UBISOFT!!
Whitebleidd	Recommended	32.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Whitebleidd/	A great improvement over Origins, which was already a great game, it takes many positive changes done to Origins like the combat, ability tree, Phylakes (now mercenaries) and gear system, and expands upon them, then it brings back the great ship mechanics from Black Flag and also expands on them by allowing for a new recruit system, in some ways similar to that of MGSV, allowing you to bring under your command almost any fighter (and sometimes noncombatants) that you may come across, all with different tiers and stats that you can examine with your eagle beforehand to decide if they are worth recruiting or not.The game also takes clear inspiration from The Witcher 3 in its approach to map exploration, storytelling and dialogue, which is a huge plus in my opinion, this time multiple playthroughs of the game is something that may be worthwhile.The world feels very alive and part of what helps create this illusion is the crime system that is tied to the mercenaries system, now stealing or killing while being in the visual range of witnesses increases the potential bounty that can be placed on your head and other mercenaries will happily try and collect. It’s a nice system that is not meant to necessarily hinder the player since these mercenaries can drop some great weapons when killed, or can even be recruited under your command.Another addition of note is region conquest, there are 2 factions that can be in charge of a region and many actions you take within a region, spring it further into chaos until a battle for dominance becomes possible, it is then up to the player which faction they will side with.Basically Odyssey is shaping up to be the best AC game so far, with its beautiful graphics, many activities and systems to sink your teeth into, it’s definitely worth it for any AC fan and anyone that enjoys rpgs or open world games in general. 
Katy Pear	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963098989/	Definitely in the top 5 best AC games. It runs great, only came across one minor bug, and it has held my attention for 7 straight hours, which is rare for me.Running on Ultra, 60 fps, with an i7 and GTX 1070
shortstack	Recommended	6.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960525484/	I haven't played any of the recent AC's so I can't comment on that, but as someone who came from the old games it's pretty amazing. You have specializations that let you focus on playing how you want to play, great cinematics and story, along with very fun fighting that requires both planning and skill, especially on higher difficulties. I love the boat fights and fact that you get multiple aspects of gameplay, I wasn't expecting this game to be this good considering Ubisoft pumps these games out faster than babies. All in all, if you enjoy rpg's you will definitely like this game.
BioBroly	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197978584480/	Exactly what I was hoping and looking for. I rarely spend full price on games, and even rarer buy them day 1 but I figured I'd take a chance with AC:O given the early stuff I'd seen. This could easily be Assassin's Creed: Witcher 3, which is fine by me since Witcher 3 ranks as my favorite game to date. Figured I could return if buyer's remorse kicked in, but not it seems silly I even thought that at all.Graphics are great (running ultra with gtx 1070, i7-7700 for reference), world is massive, Kassandra is likeable enough, but not going to earn any special place in my heart. Have had issues with fps on cinematics, but hoping that will get patched up. No bugs yet. This is my first AC game since the first, so I really don't have previous games to compare it to. I am a big RPG fan though, and this game is solid if that's what you're looking for. Highly recommend.

Jukes	Recommended	17.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jukes888/	Wow.. This game is much better then I thought it would be. Best assassins creed, with new RPG elements and so many small details that add to the world and charcters. Acting for Alexios and Kassandra are amazing. I would recommond this game to any RPG single player fans. Best one I have played since the Witcher 3. PLAY THIS!
Borgopixel	Recommended	33.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pixelcraftables/	A fantastic game that combines Origins and Black flag along with elements from more traditional rpgs to create a wonderfully varied and cohesive experience with an interesting story and addicting gameplay. Surprisingly this is possibly the least assassin's creedy game in the franchise yet it might be one of the best.
assplosion	Recommended	39.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970996026/	I'm surprised; shocked, really. I love this game. That's not something I had ever thought I would say about an Assassin's Creed game post Black Flag which, as a lot of people complained, isn't a "true" AC game.Well, just like in the case of AC4, it works to its benefit here as well by not being a "true" game of the series. In the post AC: Syndicate world of what is colloquially known as AC 2.0, this game combines systems from the other series as well as borrowing heavily from The Witcher 3 and Shadow of War/Mordor's nemesis system. In fact, what's truly incredible is that there is hardly an original idea here, but it's an immensely fun game solely because it brings so many systems together that work so great in tandem. The faux-nemesis system is great fun (as you kill/steal/etc, you gain notoriety and these guys and gals chase you all over the world, although once you kill them, a different one will take their place until you've either waited out your bounty, paid it off, or killed the guy behind putting it on your head in the first place.The quest design and the sidequests borrow heavily from The Witcher 3 in the way how they're structured and how they are given. Very rarely are there filler "collect 5 wolves furs" quests and this game has much to owe TW3 for copying its quest design. Yeah, the writing isn't as good and the world doesn't feel as lived in, but it's still immersive nonetheless. It also has an infinite quest giving bounty board which does have more of those "collect/kill X", which is fine and will give you plenty to do. Do yourself a favor and don't fast travel a whole lot. There is so much to do and explore and you will ruin it for yourself if you fast travel back and forth and only go for the main quests. Also, contrary to what some gaming blogs say, (with people that laughably calls themselves journalists) the progression system is fine and you don't need to buy the 50% XP increase to be able to enjoy. The idiots who say stuff like that are not gamers and are the same types who whine that Dark Souls doesn't have an easy mode and can't play a tutorial room in Doom without dying.It borrows from AC4 in regards to the ship combat, so there's not much to be said there. If you liked AC4/Rogue, you're gonna have loads of fun sailing the seas and smashing into, boarding, and looting Athenian, Spartan, pirate, trader, and bounty hunter ships.The large battles that pit Athenians and Spartans against each other allowing you to choose a side are great fun as well. You pretty much just flail about all over the battlefield killing soldiers, captains, and badasses until you win or lose. You get to pick which side to be on by doing quests beforehand to weaken the defending nation and you can choose to help the defenders or attackers when the time comes; the choice is yours. It's a bit gamey, but it's a freaking game. Who cares?The graphics and sound design are excellent (music sounds a lot like some TW3 songs, no surprise there). The only negative I can really point out is the performance/optimization is garbage. It's Ubi so it should come as no shock. On an I7 7700K, 32 gigs of RAM, and a 1080TI, on presets of high at 4K I am averaging 45-55 FPS. Once night comes and I use a torch or am around a lot of fire, that tanks to 30-35 FPS. Just rest and play in the daylight to avoid FPS that low, although when in caves, you're not left with much of an option but to use that torch and send your FPS to the bowels of console performance hell.All in all, this is a great game that I was actually on the fence about buying the first place. But being a sucker for Greek history, I said what the hell and dropped the cash and boy do I not regret it. I am sure that like most AC games, this will be polarizing with the hardcore "true" fans hating it and calling for it to be disowned from the series, while others like me who dip their toes in every now and again and only buy the titles once they hit $20 after 3+ years will love it. It might not be an AC game of the past, but that's what works in its favor. I burn out on open world games pretty quickly and I am hooked. I haven't had this much fun wandering an open world since TW3, so if that sounds like a glowing recommendation, that's because it is. AC: Odyssey tries to emulate TW3 and it comes pretty darn close; much closer than any game since and it should be celebrated and commended for that achievement.

You really feel like youre in greek.+You can follow the main quest or just run around or just do your own thing+Choices MATTER!+The story is one of the best in ac so far+Be sneaky or/and fight in big battles+use the Gear and abilitys to find your own playstyle +/- you have to do sidequests/grind to get higher lvls ( main quests sometimes rise pretty fast in lvl). i dont mind it but some ppl might- you need a good cpu to run it smoothly- ingame store where you can buy 50% ep and money boosts,skins and ingame money,materials (for a solo game i still dont like that)The "assassin* part comes pretty late so at the beginning it may feel like youre not playing acAll in all if you liked Origins then you should get the game and even if you stopped before origins it might be the right time to give the game a chance again

Sir Skeeter the Peter Beater	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SoggyBread007/	I haven't gotten too far into the story, and I'm only level 17 or so, but in such a short amount of time AC Odyssey has easily become one of my favourite games. Most RPG's I play, like skyrim or TW3, I enjoy the exploration and side quests/activities for a short while and then get bored and just follow the main quests. In most other games, I skip dialogue because I'm too impatient. In AC Odyssey, I find myself exploring every nook and cranny, listening to the dialogue, taking on every mission and contract I can because I want to experience it all. I love how the story is unfolding so far, and I really do like the ability to fight for either faction or both. Really fun combat (Best combat in the entire series IMO), stealth works the same as in the older games, ship battles have never been faster or smoother, and the story is superb. Honestly haven't found anything to dislike! I love this game. Also, you can ride a super macho sparkly unicorn into battle.

Tech	Recommended	19.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TechOnPC/	This is one of the best Assassin's Creed games ever made. I have not played or purchased an Assassin's Creed game in years because they all felt the exact same with barely any differences. This game is a straight up RPG that has a main character with a fully developed backstory that you care about. The map is massive and the combat variety is welcomining and allows people with different play styles to play the game however they want. There is less of the modern aspect of the story so the player can spend more time in the Greek world. There are so many quests and areas that I can easily see myself playing this game for 200+ hours. This is easily the best AC game since Black Flag and definitly worth the money.
juginst	Recommended	12.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062488106/	So far I am enjoying this game very much. The story and quests are engadging. Dialogs and voice acting are good. In general, the game is definitely of a high quality.P.S. I have old i7 6700K, GTX1070 and 16GB of RAM. So far have not encountered any technical problems. I have around 60fps at high/very high settings at 1440p (AA at medium).
Deep Six	Recommended	44.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Coenheart/	The magnitude of things to do in this game is amazing.  Even the sidequests are entertaining and worth venturing off the main path for.  Sometimes I find myself just wandering around the map aimlessly looking for cool sights to see with no purpose other than to take in the beautiful atmosphere Ubisoft has managed to create.  Admitedly, this is not a classic AC game, but that doesn't bother me.  This and AC IV are my two favorite entries in the franchise.
Morgoth	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AfanasyVsevolod/	Introduction:Had around 7 hours with the game so far, and I had a blast! It was super fun and entertaining.Pros:- BIG Open World, fun and never get bored exploring stuff.- Combat is better than Origins and quite fluid,- Story is very interesting, way better than Origins's story.- Ship combat is so entertaining, just as fun as in Black Flag.- ALOT of things to do, barely ever felt repetitive.Cons:- Minor bugs, rarely encountered but it happens.- Crashes several times until I updated my graphics card. Now it runs 5 hours straight without a single crash.- Horse movement is horrible, it is jittery and all over the place, especially when climbing hills.Overall:100% recommend. Bugs are only minor and will be patch eventually. If you have crashes, update your driver, worked for me. Otherwise, superb game, best game since Black Flag.

Or maybe you are known as a scourge of the Aegean sea for sinking dozens of ships as a pirate raider.And the other part? Well, you will maybe go and battle 5 bears at the same time for the reason of cutting their testicles of so that you can put it in an elexir together with some other weird♥♥♥♥♥♥that you will give to some grannys cuckold husband so that he can re-ignite his libido and they can go wild in the bedroom once more.

Also, contrary to what some gaming blogs say, (with people that laughably calls themselves journalists) the progression system is fine and you don't need to buy the 50% XP increase to be able to enjoy. The idiots who say stuff like that are not gamers and are the same types who whine that Dark Souls doesn't have an easy mode and can't play a tutorial room in Doom without dying.It borrows from AC4 in regards to the ship combat, so there's not much to be said there. If you liked AC4/Rogue, you're gonna have loads of fun sailing the seas and smashing into, boarding, and looting Athenian, Spartan, pirate, trader, and bounty hunter ships.The large battles that pit Athenians and Spartans against each other allowing you to choose a side are great fun as well. You pretty much just flail about all over the battlefield killing soldiers, captains, and badasses until you win or lose. You get to pick which side to be on by doing quests beforehand to weaken the defending nation and you can choose to help the defenders or attackers when the time comes; the choice is yours. It's a bit gamey, but it's a freaking game. Who cares?The graphics and sound design are excellent (music sounds a lot like some TW3 songs, no surprise there). The only negative I can really point out is the performance/optimization is garbage. It's Ubi so it should come as no shock. On an I7 7700K, 32 gigs of RAM, and a 1080TI, on presets of high at 4K I am averaging 45-55 FPS. Once night comes and I use a torch or am around a lot of fire, that tanks to 30-35 FPS. Just rest and play in the daylight to avoid FPS that low, although when in caves, you're not left with much of an option but to use that torch and send your FPS to the bowels of console performance hell.All in all, this is a great game that I was actually on the fence about buying the first place. But being a sucker for Greek history, I said what the hell and dropped the cash and boy do I not regret it. I am sure that like most AC games, this will be polarizing with the hardcore "true" fans hating it and calling for it to be disowned from the series, while others like me who dip their toes in every now and again and only buy the titles once they hit $20 after 3+ years will love it. It might not be an AC game of the past, but that's what works in its favor. I burn out on open world games pretty quickly and I am hooked. I haven't had this much fun wandering an open world since TW3, so if that sounds like a glowing recommendation, that's because it is. AC: Odyssey tries to emulate TW3 and it comes pretty darn close; much closer than any game since and it should be celebrated and commended for that achievement.

Sgt. MG	Recommended	29.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962426646/	Going to keep this review short for now, as I have only completed the first Odyssey Chapter on Alexios and there is much much more game to go through.Immersion is good.Graphics are good.Gameplay is intuitive.Story is deep and I like how your choices in dialogue or actions effect how your story plays out.You like a style of armor that you got in the beginning but don't want to lose out on armor defense points? Well, just like it's predecessor (Origins) the upgrading of a equipment is a major pull through for AC games.Naval Combat is fun.  Nothing like watching your boat going full ram speed into another ship and watch it sink.I saw some negative reviews that stated they could not play but they have the same spec in hardware that I have for CPU and video card.  However, I have experienced a minor issue that has not repeated itself so far.On my first desychronization death, the loading splash screen did not appear but the loading background music was playing and I could heard the loading sound prompts going off.  I couldn't do anything except close the program and restart.I will update my review when I get through more of the game.Edit: I have an i5-4690k CPU @3.50GHz and GeForce GTX 960
Kilion	Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mike2234/	I dont nomally do reviews but i feel like i need to. 1st. Comp specs i7 6700k 32gigs 1080ftw playing at 3440x1440 Cutscense are locked at 30fps and you will notice it. The game world i get a playable 45-60fps which isnt to bad. With shadows on medium and such. The problem is i get massive fps drops throughout the world. Which makes it hard to play. I read some reviews before buying it and saw that other people where having the same or kind of the same problems. I do enjoy the game so i wont refund it but understand you might be in the same boat or you might get lucky. Just my opinion

NoHomoThou	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nohomothou/	Great game,good story. Like that they went from normal AC to more witcher style. Would wait a couple of weeks after release to buy so you do not have to get flamed over game crashing mid quest.
Kapoof	Recommended	23.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970243998/	I love the direction they're taking Assassin's Creed. They've created something that can be mentioned in the same category as The Witcher 3 or Elder Scrolls. I love that they're supporting the game through 2019 with episodic content. I'm taking my time, playing with Exploration Mode on and it's the most immersive rpg i've played in a long time. It's smart to change the series up a bit, and create these massive worlds based on real human history. First Ancient Egypt, and now Ancient Greece. GTX 1070 and i7 8700k runs (almost) Ultra for me, at 1440p. I turn Volumetric Clouds down a couple notches, and keep AA at low. Those seem to make the biggest difference in peformance, and don't really make much difference in the look of the game. It will dip to 50fps on occasion, but mostly 60+. It's one of the very best looking games ever created.Now, the game does have in-game purchases. Well, i HATE that. Charging extra money for gear, weapons, cosmetics that should just be in the game. Horrible, i wish there was a way gamers could take a stand against it, but we've been trying for years. Ever since Horse Armor in Oblvion. The uproar back then never stopped them. Not sure what will. You don't NEED to buy any of it, and I certainly won't be. But i'll be really ticked off if i never get a chance to get that Pegasus skin for the horse without having to buy it. With that out of the way.... the game itself is AMAZING. A mind bogglingly massive world. Ship battles. The best combat the series has ever seen. Kassandra is GREAT. You're given the story slowly as you go, and with each reveal i'm feeling SUPER into it. Even the sidequests introduce you to some character and their little story, to give it meaning. It's really the best of The Witcher, Elder Scrolls, a bit of Tomb Raider, with Dark Souls-ish combat. Expanded gear from AC: Origins. A really good talent tree where everything feels useful, and the choices are important (but you can respec any time you like!) Everything feels just right to me.Honestly, i can't say enough good things about AC: Odyssey. At this time, i've only got 17 hours in, but it's already one of my favorite games in a loooong time. I'm not mindlessly running from map marker to map marker like i end up doing in similar games. I feel immersed in the world. Interested in the story. Somehow, everything came together in this game and it's really pulled me in!

Avril	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AvrilEverett/	This game is 100% worth it, amazing soundtrack, amazing gameplay, alot of collectibles, gearing, activities, etc.You'll likely get 100 of hours of gameplay out of it, I've already had 8.5 hours at this review at simply completing merely 2 zones and still not fully collecting everything or quest everything that I would want to. The story is breathtaking, the graphics even more so, definitely a must have AC game, they've done well. No crashes or glitches found so far.

Afjell	Recommended	36.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035367075/	Its like origins, but with better parkour, "swifter" assassination animations and you have ships! Most of the RPG elements are really good for example: Choices (do they matter¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?)  truly open world, you dont need to start a quest to finish it, when you look out to the horizon you can see giant ship battles. Personally i dont like some of the abilities that come with the RPG but they are easily avoidable, if you dont want teleportation abilities, just dont use/unlock them 4Head. You dont have a hidden blade, however i feel like this is a better stealth game because the AI communicate better and you can just hide in a bush and get free assassinations if the enemy knows you are there
Gormander	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gormander/	A great game. Still has the feel of the old assasin cread combat but the fresh new take on the game with the awesome time in history that its set it makes it a great buy if your looking for an addicting single player game.
faggitus maximus	Recommended	27.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rackcitybichrakciti/	its fun
БредСивойКолбасы	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/celphirio/	I used to hate Assassin's Creed. Ever since #3, it just seemed like Ubi was pulling a new one out of their @ss every year. Black Flag was okay, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Unity and Syndicate had cool settings, but couldn't keep my attention past the intro sequences. Once the abortion that was the movie came out in 2016, I gave up hope. But then Origin rolled around, and I had a great time. If you like Origin, you'll love Odyssey. It's similar, without being a copy-and-paste. It improves on a lot of things, and it was worth a day-one buy.Pros:-The dialogue is much more interesting now. You feel a bit more in control. Even if the voice acting and script is the same nonsense that AC has always had, I felt like I was actually involved in the story, and could change it with my decisions. And there was a surprising amount of nuance. They keep it simple, but you get the option to lie, persuade, intimidate, and ask for more information. Sometimes it had some pretty cool consequences, as well. There was one awkward but still enjoyable scene where Alexios can either woo a woman into bed with him, add her to his crew, or say goodbye to her forever. In summary, I actually care about dialogue now, and it does seem to actually change the story, even if the change is not drastic. -The story is a lot more compelling that previous titles. It's not amazing, and it comes with its fair share of problems. But it's a step in the right direction. -Sea Battles are AMAZING. They are a tad bit buggy, and the rowers have an embarrassingly limited endurance. You can have them row for 4 seconds at first, before they peter out. I believe this can be upgraded. Anyway, I thorougly enjoyed the sea battles. Ramming was very satisfying, as well as boarding. It could be annoying because sometimes only a handful of your men come onboard the enemy ship, and when they die you're on your own. Some people have said it gets boring, but so far I love it.-Like I said, Odyssey is quite similar to Origins, mostly so in the graphics. Similar building designs, similar rock formations, similar fort and bandit hideout arrangements. However, there was a noticeable graphical update, especially in regards to the character models and the lighting. I took screenshots of some of the characters during cutscenes because they looked DAMN good. Where Origins did a wonderful job showing how beautiful the desert can be, Odyssey shows how beautiful blue ocean, beaches, and bright green forests can be. There are some absolutely breathtaking moments throughout the game. This is definitely the most beautiful Assassin's Creed game so far, and probably one of the most beautiful open world games I have seen to date (as far as nature and the ancient world/fantasy goes).-Something Origin lacked was big battles. Now, with the focus of Odyssey being weakening the Greek state controlling an area, there's the opportunity for a huge battle once you finish all the main quests for that area. -Combat has improved. It feels a bit more streamlined and less frustrating. The main character is more responsive. The skill tree has been altered slightly, so now you have abilties that can be activated for a short time, such as poison, shieldbreaking, and so on. They even added a few cool little bits, such as your character giving a final stab to a victim when confirming a kill.-On top of that, you know have non-lethal stealth options. You can choke someone out, rather than kill them. This gives you the option of recruiting them to your ship's crew.-The game ran pretty damn well from day one. The settings didn't automatically adjust for my hardware, but with a few changes I had this thing running on Ultra-high at 1080p on my 1080, with a consistent 50-60 fps. -A small thing I noticed is that the AI will actually duck away from arrows and hide over cover. This is a nice little detail, and even if it's the only improvement, I like it.-It really feels like a war-torn world. You can  feel the negative effects of the war. Certain areas belong to certain factions, and there are frequent quests involving food shortages, refugee crisis, bandit robbery, etc. With the dialogue options, you can now choose if you will do what you can to spare the innocent, or you can choose to take advantage everywhere you go. Cons: -Even though the dialogue interaction has changed, the dialogue is still mostly garbage. Sad, considering many of these new character models look wonderful.-Same bugs as before with the horse, running into everything and being an absolute retard when I call for him. Now there's a new bug (perhaps it's not, someone feel free to clarify) where the horse slows down to a canter anytime he's within 25 meters of a town or stronghold. This is annoying as hell. I want to get to my destination faster, or I want to run away from a bounty hunter, and I can't.-The AI are the same for the most part, but now they have super-vision. This may be a bug that will be fixed after the first patch, I hope. Several times it seems like they saw me through walls, and there were quite a few bugs where I couldn't do a leap assassination or a stealth attack. -On top of idiot AI, they cannot tell when you are with them or against them. Once, a group of Athenians attacked a Spartan camp. I came in to help, took a few swings at Athenians, and in the process accidentally hit a Spartan. WHen they finished with the Athenians, they all came after me. I had to flee the camp and hide in the bushes until they calmed down. When I came back, they didn't recognize me. -The exploration mode is cool, but to truly appreciate it you have to remove the HUD as well. It looks nice, and it was satisfying to find a place just from the description that someone gave you. The problem is, it sometimes means that finding the place is near impossible. Not because you're doing it without hints, but because the directions are unclear. I'm having a ball with this game, and this is coming from someone that hated AC almost religiously for years. Ubisoft has really earned back some of my trust, even if at the end of the day they're a cash cow. At least now we can say they are an honest cash cow. My only concern is that with the success of Origin and Odyssey, they'll just start reskinning the experience, and then we'll see nothing but a repeat of what AC has been ever since #2. But if they can incrementally improve these games, then I will gladly purchase the next title.Highly recommended! If you do everything, then you really will hit 100+ hours on this thing.
Steeltooth	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JDgenerate/	I've played it enough to know it's definitely a good game. I wouldn't call it better or worse than Origins because at its core it's essentially the same game, just with some added things you've already seen in past games, like a 1:1 copy of the ship combat from AC4 and reducing threat levels in regions so you can take on the big boss (which is still just a big guy with a big weapon like before). It still has that horrible slow motion on detect thing from Origins that doesn't enhance the game at all and is just a terrible game mechanic all around. And unfortunately you still can't turn it off.Two things I'll say about the game is the combat is more active and engaging, if still plenty button mashy and the underwater areas are leagues ahead of what you got in Origins. There're plenty more little enhancements but I didn't find any of them to be particularly noteworthy. I guess having a large portion of the loot items be marked as having to steal them is kind of cool. I find the combat to be somewhat easy despite reports to the contrary. It's just not that hard to parry and dodge your way through a horde of enemies. The hardest part is remembering which skills you have assigned to which buttons. I thought Origins was hard until you overleveled. I'm glad they took overleveling out of this game.They seem to have taken it out that you can call your horse in a hostile zone to make a quick getaway, which I think is a bad change.Also if you use minimal or disabled HUD then photo mode is broken. As in you can take pictures but it doesn't show you any of the photo options. Turning on any of the deactivated HUD options doesn't fix it. Even if you choose minimal HUD then turn everything back on it doesn't fix it. You actually have to have show all or light selected. If you want minimal or disabled HUD to work with photo mode then you have to choose show all or light then turn off all the HUD option you don't want. Isn't that weird?All in all I'm happy with my purchase.

Gameplay is fun as hell, story is unbeleivably intruiging, voiceacting is meh, open world is amazing, although nothing can beet Bayek, the only thing I liked in Origins was him. Overall, this is no groundbreaking RPG, but it is a step in the right direction and fixes many of Origins failures.

Venomous Cuirassier	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034908515/	AC Odyssey controls and feels much the same as AC Origins, which is not a bad thing. The combat feels a bit more involved than the traditional counter-move based of older titles. So far I haven't really found much to link it to the AC universe other than a short outside of the Animus section, which again, is not a bad thing since it hasn't taken away from the game in any way and lets you start exploring the world almost straight away. Looks beautiful and has run smoothly for me, like handling, graphics are similar in quality to AC Origins, although a little more varied colour palette given the location for the setting. I very much like the ancient Greece setting and how the game presents itself so far, overall positive experience thusfar!

I'm glad they took overleveling out of this game.They seem to have taken it out that you can call your horse in a hostile zone to make a quick getaway, which I think is a bad change.Also if you use minimal or disabled HUD then photo mode is broken. As in you can take pictures but it doesn't show you any of the photo options. Turning on any of the deactivated HUD options doesn't fix it. Even if you choose minimal HUD then turn everything back on it doesn't fix it. You actually have to have show all or light selected. If you want minimal or disabled HUD to work with photo mode then you have to choose show all or light then turn off all the HUD option you don't want. Isn't that weird?All in all I'm happy with my purchase.
JarmenKell	Recommended	86.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/malrox/	lvl 30 now. took 60 hours. but it doesnt mean in 20 levels game is over, on the contrary. i just did so many side quests. game is fun, lots of silly things here and there like, better not say. but its worth the money more than black flag. although black flag was better sea battles. i enjoy this one more due to its better story line so far. and many interesting historical characters, like Socrates. there are bugs here and there but nothing game breaking
Deathwish	Recommended	23.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Deathwish2334/	I do not usually write reviews. This is probably my first tbh, but i love this game so much it's hand down the best AC game to date. People are too negative about the microtransactions you don't need them to play the game. The zones level with you so you can stay in them as long as you want and even on nightmare difficulty the game is still very enjoyable. I hope the next one is this good.

Jukrates	Not Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198405357166/	The game is just amazing. There's only one huge problem: it requires an AVX (Advanced Vector eXtension) processor. It is playable with my Intel Core i5-7400 on low graphics, but that's not what I paid for. I don't get it... every other game, including TW Warhammer 2, run high graphics without any problems. Why would you require AVX processor when it's been proven to be unnecessary? And above all, I first heard about this from angry players, not from Ubisoft! I REALLY hope Ubisoft fixes this with a patch or something, which is said to be done with previous titles too. If Ubisoft gives a dämn about their reputation and fixes this, I would rate the game 10/10.            Thank you for your time.
Some Old Fool	Recommended	17.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JackaL187Gaming/	Absolutely the best Assassin's Creed yet.The best game I've played in a bit honestly.Another thing is that I didn't like Origins toomuch. But this here is a much better game.The story alone is great and makes it worththe price. The graphics obliterate the last game.I didn't think the last game looked great honestly.The gameplay is outstanding. The amount ofcontent is unmatched by any game of this type.It's so massive. Characters are awesome. There's just so much here and even though Ubisoftmakes some decent games sometimes, this gamefeels far above their capabilities in quality. I've beenextremely surprised so far.I haven't ran into a paywall yet but I hear a lotabout it. People do tend to blow these claims outof proportion sometimes but I definitely understandtheir frustration and I'll be heartbroken if I run intosaid paywall because it'll ruin an incredible game.Fingers crossed
weitao.y4he	Recommended	38.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/neverdiephoenix/	Game is more in-depth and better than Origins. Best writing in a AC series so far, and Kassandra's voice acting is on point. The new default FOV is a bit weird though, recommend to change to  90%

You get bounty when commit crime7. Beautiful landscape8. Mythical beast to fight against - First time something like this appears in an Assassin's creed game9. You can learn a bit of history thanks to this game10. Despite the game having microtransaction u are able to get strong gear even without spending money11. War system - decide which side to take if fight for Sparta or AthenesCons:1. Microtransaction: Needless to say there a microtransaction where u can buy new gears and weapons from the Helix shop2.

tomb	Recommended	11.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tombsv/	This is one of those games I thought I would never play. I have never played a Assassin's Creed game before, but were interested in this game after seeing the trailer. So got fairly happy when a friend gifted me the game!Anyway, yesterday I played for 7 hours and had so much fun the entire time! The main character got so much personality and the open world fits my playstyle. I play with exploration mode on, which makes the game not give you clear questmarkers and you have to listen more to the questgiver. Which adds to my immersion of the game. It is actually enjoyable to get lost at times and then realize "oh he ment the actually place named East, not just head east!" and so on.And then before heading to bed, after 7 hours of playing, the title shows up and I'm just "what? That were just the opening?" So I'm pretty thrilled to continue playing and explore more!
Jadyv	Recommended	23.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969833065/	This is a very short review of AC Odyssey (Note: I havent finished the game):I have played the game for 20 hours now as im writing this interview which is a very long time because the game has been out for 2 or 3 days now. Everytime I boot up the game and try to do a quest to progress further into the story (which is good though repetitive at times) I always get lost in the HUGE world doing something else be it Exploring or doing sidequest Or even killing Mercenarys to get loot. The mercenary system is also very cool and if you are fan of the Shadow of War/Shadow of Mordor franchise you will love it. Because it takes a lot of cool aspects from the nemesis system from SOW/SOM and puts it in Assassins Creed. With 20 Hours and only around 35% complete story i love this game it just shows how huge it is and how you can just get lost in this amazing ancient greek world. I would highly recommend buying the game because it offers a lot of playtime and fun with cool new features in an Gigantic and most importantly Beautiful attention to detail ancient Greek World. I would give the game 9/10.
Timothy	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/baconost/	Considering Ubisoft's record this game suprised me in how polished it is.AMD was their Graphics partner on this and the game runs fantastic.I'd buy it on a sale of 15% or more.
TexasCajun	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deathtoll_david/	Probably the largest open world I’ve seen in a game yet. It has a grind that rivals Skyrim and Witcher 3 so if that is what you like then you will love this. Great RPG elements that allow you to play how you want rather than having a linear progression forced on you. The story is good, but the real joy is being able to run around and interact with the world on your own. Also it’s nice to see you don’t break future quests by doing this.Not sure why I see reviews complaining about microtransactions. It's pretty clear to me you can play the entire game without buying anything. It's a single player game, so why does it matter if I want to look pretty?
Alicée	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2289076850/	Truly excellent Assassin‘s creed for playing with so much elements , sea battles also like the Black flag as it was ,even better if it can hunt whales just like the Black flag . Various kind of missions rich the experience of playing .This one integrates almost all of the forms of playing of the Assassin's creed 's series before .For last , many players say the Assassin's Creed is not going to be the assassin any more , i just want to say , if you want to be an assasin, just update your skills for assasin you'll find the original taste of ASSASSIN'S CREED , never trying to be a fighter just be an assassin as you like .......Looking forward to seeing the Assassin's creed making better and better !

Shadowkiller324	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowkiller324/	This game is outstanding, I havent played a good assassin's creed game in a while (Mind you i skipped out on origin but i may go back). There are only 2 problems that I have had witht his game.     1. The ship mechanic feels kinda lazy, but honestly thats fine I don't care to much about that.and     2. Every now, and then when I die or "desynchronize" the game just goes black and never loads, forcing me to stop the game with task manager, and restarting it.
Ninjatronix	Recommended	16.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068502516/	My no BS review of this Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. I have NOT played Origins so this style of AC is new to me.I'm running the game max setting at 1440p on a GTX 1080 FE and an I7 6700k. It will play at 4k but at mid settings.This game isn't assassin’s creed, it's more like Middle Earth Shadow of Mordor but not as fully fleshed out. You start with basically no skills then unlock them to become more of a badass later in the game. It has RPG elements but they’re pretty basic. Some of the game systems just don’t make any sense though.Things I like:-It's a pretty game that runs fairly well.-Combat can be fun and challenging (when the buttons respond).-RPG Elements are kinda cool. I’d like to see a sword and shield or spear and shield. (May later in the game???)-it’s cool to find rarer and rarer items and see your badassery go up.-infiltrating bases and killing bounty hunters can be fun.-Bows are OP, but you’ll need some advantage because the enemies can suck to kill.-upgrading weapons to current level is awesome.-upgrading and ship combat are pretty cool.-You can respec your character at any time to change it up.-You get new loot at a pretty fast rate.Things I don't really like-Input lag or buttons not always responding to the input. This needs to be tighten up. I play with controller and my friend plays with keyboard and both of us are seeing input lag or inputs not even registering. Combat is fast and you need your controls to respond to the input.-Really a missed opportunity with the RPG elements. I'm playing as an assassin, but will find hammers or heavy bladed weapons with assassin damage or hunter damage. Heavy armor too. It's like they give you a piece of gear then randomly attach attributes to them. So I look weird playing an assassin in full heavy armor and stealth killing someone with a halberd. -All level 10 weapons do the exact same DPS. How do daggers have the same DPS as a hammer? What’s the base damage and weapon speed so the DPS makes more sense? -Randomly my quest giver will end up attacking me or running for its life and dying forcing auto-fail of the quest. This has happened many times.The quests can be really lame. i.e. deliver this to my husband on the front lines of the war, after walking 150m, give the item to him, get a chest armor and 900xp. I mean why couldn’t she just walk 150m and give it to him?-fortresses will have all the loot, you just burned or collect, respawn after leaving the area.-You’ll have a container you can loot, but next to it will be another container that says “steal”. You can steal it and is really no different than looting other than if you get caught they might send guards after you. You don’t fence any stolen goods. So it’s weird that you have to steal anything. And there’s money all over the cities. Why do the people put 3 drachmae in pots outside their houses?Overall this game is fun and once you get past all the game’s random quirks it picks up. The game doesn’t know if it wants to be a realistic type AC game or an RPG with dragons and spells. I have a skill (like Shadow of Mordor’s arrow assassination skill) where I through my spear and I teleport to the enemy as it hits him so I can assassinate him. It’s a cool skill but doesn’t seem to fit in an AC game.Enemies can be rough if you're a level or two under the enemy level. That coupled with inputs not being recognized and you're left frustrated that you can't beat a guy two levels higher because the controls are sloppy.I've had a few game crashes and I can't seem to get to my uplay without the game crashing.However, complaining aside, this is a game that needs to be fleshed out a little more and needs patches to fix input auto-switch, game crashes, inputs not registering, and tightening of the controls. As of writing this, my controller turned off in game, forcing me to go back into the menu and trying to turn off auto-switch.I do recommend this game but it needs some major fixes. This is not a 9 out of 10 game. More of a 7 out of 10 for me.  The AC games are better AC games than Odyssey, Shadow of Mordor/War does the skills and assassinations better this game, and I bet the Witcher 3’s does combat better. What we’re left with is a mediocre game (compared to the others I’ve mentioned) that doesn’t really know what it wants to be but is still a lot of fun to play.
Asim Sheikh	Recommended	31.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/asimsheikh/	This is one of the best games I have played so far. It takes you on a journey, an odyssey if you will, that engages you with action and heartfelt moments. I am playing the Kassandra protagonist, and her voice acting combined with the motion capture that animates her gestures and facial expressions breathes life into a game character that elevates the experience to new heights.Graphically the game is beautiful, and the performance on an I7 7700k GTX 1070ti with 16gb of memory at 1080p&180hz has been around 70 t0 80 fps at Ultra High settings with adaptive vsynch turned on. I feel like this game is a masterpiece that gamers will be talking about for some time.

Kansur_Krew	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rayooi/	Best game I've played this year. The open world is very well crafted. It is massive with an impressive attention to detail with respect to geographical and urban locations (play in exploration mode to maximise immersion). Main and side quests are for the most part, very well crafted and engaging and most of the named characters are very well done. Side activities inclusive of timed quests and notice board missions can get very repetitive and monotonous, but these are entirely optional and you can do them whenever you feel like making a quick buck or to get some resources. Conquest gameplay isn't as fleshed out as Ubi made it out to be, but it still is a fairly fun feature that you could tackle for good loot if nothing else. The game is very resource grindy, but I wouldn't worry too much about that early on, playing the game casually and completing as many side quests and locations as you can will progressively get you pretty much everything you need by the time you reach a later stage in the game, though I understand that most people may not have the leisure to do this due to real life obligations and time constraints.So far, ACOD has been a very smooth experience on PC but it is a very graphically demanding game so don't expect smooth frames if you don't have the hardware for it, but so far, it runs more or less as well as ACO does for me. Gameplay and animations may look clunky from a viewer's perspective, but they play very well in person. If you're worried about microtransactions, they are there and I hate the fact that they are, (this♥♥♥♥♥♥is despicable, I mean I've already paid the full price for the game) but they are by no means invasive. The inclusion of microtransactions has not impacted my gaming experience in any way. But the oikos of the olympians and the whole thing with orichalcum is a bit of a scam though. To reiterate, these are entirely optional and they aren't fundamental to the gameplay experience. I am judging the game with respect to the core values, features and mechanics of the game, I don't think it does justice to the game if I were to place undue emphasis on some stupid sideshow money-making gimmick implemented at the behest of the game's publishers over the effort and creativity put into making the game by the dev team. Ignore them entirely if you hate them.My biggest gripe with this game would be how spongey named enemies (normal mooks are still easy to kill) are, but there are various workarounds to combat this issue. Proper character specing and strategic use of abilities can fetch you clean and quick kills on bosses/mini-bosses. Turning down the difficulty also helps if that suits you.In conclusion, the game has its flaws, but it is an incredibly enjoyable and engaging experience. I never found myself bored playing it due to the sheer amount of things to do. It gets a 9/10 from me, by no means the greatest game of all time and by no means revolutionary (it builds on concepts already introduced by existing IPs ie. The Witcher 3 and Shadow of War, nothing wrong with that), but a solid game nonetheless.I reckon the game is worth the full price, it is chock full of content that will keep you playing for many many hours. Reminder that this review is not definitive, it is subjective to my experience of the game. Other people may experience the game differently to me. Have a good one.

mishabrycefuentes96	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bryce1296/	to start with this game is great and definitely worth the purchase ,the atmosphere is great and the world is full of npc's with great amount of detail even to the smallest touch. the story definitely is different so far and really lets you decide the course you wanna go and the steps you wanna take .that being said i feel like this game so far has earned the assassins title and just gives people the real challenge of being an assassin and doesnt guide you through how you should kill your target , hell to be honest with you im a serial killer ingame but this game makes me think wether or not i should kill this whole part of the map or save them and that in itself makes this game great. BUT dont expect it to be perfect of course there are some bugs in the game  like if you die  the loading screen crashes and youd have to restart the game (dont worry it definitely saved your progress). or that the horse your riding is sometimes an even better assassin than you (i literally walked on rope between two buildings with my horse) , and of course the occassional physics fall when you get stuck between two rocks while climbing a  mountain . but we cant expect a perfect game with a map this size and i believe it will still be patched and fixed in the future , all in all  id definitely say this game is one of the best purchases ive done this year and i will surely see myself replaying this game till i get all the other endings.
justreece93	Recommended	23.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025198962/	It may change as the game continues but the stealth potion doesn't seem to be as pronounced until later levels. Other than that it is very good as far as the story line, especially if you liked the movie "300".

That writer guy	Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/writersrus/	Found Origins boring, Odyssey been nothing except fun I'll do a full review once I beat it.
MeldinX2	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041819636/	So far this game is amazing. I'm only around 25 hours into it so this is just my first impressions.The world-design and scale of things are just out of this world. If you liked Origins then this will be even better in my opinion. The world is alot bigger than in origins but alot of it are water and oceans. Which leads me into ship combat. It's back and it's alot of fun. It's fast and arcady, i was worried it was going to be more limited since you only have spears and arrows because if the time period this is set in but it's not the case. There are ships to plunder and alot of customizations and resources to find. The story so far has also been great. It definitely have a diffrent feel to it than previous games however since you play as a mercenary and not an assassin. They also went full RPG this time around with dialouge choices which some of them acually do make a diffrence later on. Also you can get side missions from people you spared as a previous choice you did in a mission. Which you might not have gotten if you choose to kill them. One thing i do miss is the awesome animus cutscenes you got when you assassinated a story target. So far i have not seen one but they might come later on in the game but it does not seem like it. Gameplay is also improved from origins. It feels more fluid and the new ability system makes the combat even better. It's just alot of fun to spartan kick a dude from a cliff to their deaths or to poison your weapons and make their health slowly tick down. There is also alot of loot and legendary sets to find. That all come with a set bonus if you wear all of them. You can also this time around engrave your items with bonus stats depending on your playstyle. And now to the controversy about the microtransactions. Like in Origins you have the store that sells both armours,mounts and resources. And it's still quite non-intrusive. I think it shows you one notification in the beginning of the game and then it shuts up about it. One new thing is that they also sell EXP and resources boosts. And many people say that they have made the game super grindy because of it. Well, i don't think that's really true. Like in origins you will need to do some side missions in order to level up enough to continue with the main story, but as a big RPG in the vein of the Witcher 3 i don't feel like the side missions are a chore or a grind. It's part of the game experience and i do think that if you skip them then you are missing out and the game would not be that great. In all my 25 hours of playtime i never felt like i was grinding or needed to do more boring stuff to progress. If anything i was overleveled. Sure i did do most of the normal side missions but they are really good and give great rewards so you WANT to do them. But if you are the kind of person that ONLY want to rush through the main story missions(and miss like 80% of the game) then maybe this is not the right game for you. However if you liked for example games like The Witcher 3 and plays it in a similar way as that game then you will have no problems leveling up without feeling that it's a grind. Conclusion: If you like huge Open-world RPG's and you liked AC:Origins then you will really enjoy this game. It's like Origins but bigger and better in almost every aspect(unless you liked the egyptian setting more). The side quests are interesting and feel more meaningful and the main story so far has been great. Gameplay is smooth and rewardning and there is just a ton of stuff and content to explore and do.
rayalx	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033800911/	After 7 hours in game,  it now start to open! ...and it is huge ! i just scratch the begining and make an ideea how big it is!

Maelleth	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198151719281/	Went to kill the Kalydonian Boar. It has helluva lot of health, my little strikes seem to make no damage. So, gonna be a fun fight trying to dodge it's charges at me.But wait! Little boars spawn everywhere and they can charge too! Gotta kill them and dodge the big boar.But wait! Someone hired a mercenary after me, and here he is! F*ck that, I pay my bounty so he can fight the big boar.But wait! A mountain lion joins the party! It decides to fight the little boars.I kill the mountain lion, and keep killing the little boars while shooting the big boar with arrows. Finally the big boar kills the mercenary (all credit for that to me thanks!). So it turns on me again.But wait! I have the lowest health so I have to run away from it and dodge so my healing ability can regenerate. After healing, Spartan kick the Kalydonian Boar in the face and kill it.5/5 would fight alongside a mountain lion again.
Daniel	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009967767/	Firstly, what’s wrong the Cons;1. I am not a fan of pay to cheat systems. 2. The full version of the game is expensive £95.99 (eek), Some of us have kids to feed Ubisoft.3. Doesen't Support Sli. I have a sli laptop a bit dated 980M sli. Feel like I spent way too much on a laptop 4 years ago now most AAA games don't support sli.4. The Exp and in game money boost is only for 2 hours gameplay probably not worth it should have been 20 to 30-hour game play limit for all new game starts considering the price.Pros.  So FAR So Good.1. In my opinion it’s the best Assassins Creed intro ever.2. Visually stunning and beautiful graphics.3. Addictively fun with that just one more quest factor...4. Story so far is immersive and attention grabbing with that nagging wife drowning out factor.5. Worth the money seems to be friendly to those who don't want to pay to cheat with resources dotted all over.6. Glad I did not listen to the nay Sayers who are cursing and swearing about it.7. Going to bed thinking I should pull an all-nighter on it.8. Considering the age of my graphics Card and CPU still pulls a constant 35 to 40fps and is still playable but once I got into it didn’t notice was too busy playing the game to care.9. Probably the best Assassins Creed game I have ever played.10. Cut scenes are well acted and capture the imagination.11. Looking forward to the remastered Assassin’s Creed III and Liberation.12. So far it is clear a lot of man hours and attention has been put into the game seems well optimised even for my old banger to handle.Conclusion so Far - Well-done Ubisoft looking forward to playing more of this Game.

Ronin75	Not Recommended	27.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006243109/	Edit, changed my recomendation to "no". Reason being, the grind  is getting unbarable once you reach level 15+ and it seems this was intended by UBI in order to get you to buy more microtansaction items. In order to keep your items up to date you have to spend so many resources that you have to grind for hours if you do not want to buy extra resources from store. It basically ruins an otherwise great game. A real shame.

justreece93	Recommended	23.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025198962/	It may change as the game continues but the stealth potion doesn't seem to be as pronounced until later levels. Other than that it is very good as far as the story line, especially if you liked the movie "300".
Voodoo-Spirit89	Recommended	7.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gpanoiah/	Amazing Game. if you liked AC-Origins: it's some kind of similiar and different at the same time  just better in almost any possible aspect of the game. The gameplay is super fun, The graphics are stunning, the PC optimization is better, The fighting controls are more tight and enjoyable, The sound and music is amazing, the world is huge and beautiful , the story is top notch, the exploration and roaming is very satisfing. Easly one of the best AC games for a very long time.

diirsu	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060709968/	I bought this game 7 Oct, have played it more bing-y than I've ever played a game. It feels like a combination of assassins creed 2, Skyrim and Tomb Raider with some unique features to it as well. The fighting is phenomenal, it really brings you to the edge of your seat and isn't by any means easy but very personalised. The world is free and open but doesn't feel overwhelming and in the mode where you have to find the targets yourself it's done in a fun way, taking 'eagle eye' very literally. Ofcourse flying as a bird is the best part. Can recommend to everyone, and has been worth the money so far

rayalx	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033800911/	After 7 hours in game,  it now start to open! ...and it is huge ! i just scratch the begining and make an ideea how big it is! You have customization , you have stats, items , skills , choices that matter ! superb graphics ! OMG! Greate game for me !  Advice:  if you struggle with in game FPSs , tweaks settings like volumetric clouds and AA! i Recomend this to  1. RPGs fans, 2 Those who loves swords, blood ,fights, gladiators! 3. I will not recommend this to AC purists!
MeldinX2	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041819636/	So far this game is amazing. I'm only around 25 hours into it so this is just my first impressions.The world-design and scale of things are just out of this world. If you liked Origins then this will be even better in my opinion. The world is alot bigger than in origins but alot of it are water and oceans. Which leads me into ship combat. It's back and it's alot of fun. It's fast and arcady, i was worried it was going to be more limited since you only have spears and arrows because if the time period this is set in but it's not the case. There are ships to plunder and alot of customizations and resources to find. The story so far has also been great. It definitely have a diffrent feel to it than previous games however since you play as a mercenary and not an assassin. They also went full RPG this time around with dialouge choices which some of them acually do make a diffrence later on. Also you can get side missions from people you spared as a previous choice you did in a mission. Which you might not have gotten if you choose to kill them. One thing i do miss is the awesome animus cutscenes you got when you assassinated a story target. So far i have not seen one but they might come later on in the game but it does not seem like it. Gameplay is also improved from origins. It feels more fluid and the new ability system makes the combat even better. It's just alot of fun to spartan kick a dude from a cliff to their deaths or to poison your weapons and make their health slowly tick down. There is also alot of loot and legendary sets to find. That all come with a set bonus if you wear all of them. You can also this time around engrave your items with bonus stats depending on your playstyle. And now to the controversy about the microtransactions. Like in Origins you have the store that sells both armours,mounts and resources. And it's still quite non-intrusive. I think it shows you one notification in the beginning of the game and then it shuts up about it. One new thing is that they also sell EXP and resources boosts. And many people say that they have made the game super grindy because of it. Well, i don't think that's really true. Like in origins you will need to do some side missions in order to level up enough to continue with the main story, but as a big RPG in the vein of the Witcher 3 i don't feel like the side missions are a chore or a grind. It's part of the game experience and i do think that if you skip them then you are missing out and the game would not be that great. In all my 25 hours of playtime i never felt like i was grinding or needed to do more boring stuff to progress. If anything i was overleveled. Sure i did do most of the normal side missions but they are really good and give great rewards so you WANT to do them. But if you are the kind of person that ONLY want to rush through the main story missions(and miss like 80% of the game) then maybe this is not the right game for you. However if you liked for example games like The Witcher 3 and plays it in a similar way as that game then you will have no problems leveling up without feeling that it's a grind. Conclusion: If you like huge Open-world RPG's and you liked AC:Origins then you will really enjoy this game. It's like Origins but bigger and better in almost every aspect(unless you liked the egyptian setting more). The side quests are interesting and feel more meaningful and the main story so far has been great. Gameplay is smooth and rewardning and there is just a ton of stuff and content to explore and do.
[Epic!]killy	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/epickilly/	Super addictive, just one more mission and i go to sleep.The good: - good story - cool loot - good fighting mechanics - good naval combatThe bad: - i'm not a big fan of upgrading your items...basically you can have the same set the whole gameIf you played Origins, this is even better.Still no Witcher3, but it's the best ou can get and it's super addictive!Enough said, one more mission and i go to sleep.
MaleSensitivity	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaleSensitivity/	So far, this game is pretty good.  I wasted the entire day playing it and I have no major complaints.
Tethys-995	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TDM95/	TL;DR: SJW's suck but Kassandra rocks and this game was a really pleasant surprise.As someone who doesn't like the sjw movement in video games, I was worried that Kassandra would be another stereotypical Mary Sue character with very little motivation and very little substance to her personality.  I know that the Spartans didn't have female soldiers and I'm pretty sure the other Greek civilizations didn't have female soldiers either.  With that being said, I ♥♥♥♥ing love Kassandra!  It took me totally by surprise.  I saw Alexios's character in gameplay videos and I thought he was yet another dull and typical guy character in the long list of AC games.  Kassandra is totally different.  She's funny, tough, and kind of makes me think of a female Han Solo like character.  She makes this game for me and the voice actress for Kassandra deserves a lot of praise for her conviction in her lines.So how's the game?  It's grindy and it has microtransactions which I despise, and yet I love every minute of this game.  The combat is meaty and you feel like Leonidas or Achilles delivering lethal strikes with a spear!  It's really one of those games you need to play in order to appreciate how amazing it is.  Keep in mind, this is coming from someone who has played every AC game except Syndicate.  I was very let down with Revelations, AC3, and Unity.  It felt like the series was dying.  I'm glad to see that this game is putting the series back on it's feet but I do feel a lot of times that these games set in the ancient world should be called something else like "Ancient Warrios: Greece" or something like that.  Regardless, I love this game and it's currently one of my favorite games of all time.  This will keep me very happy while we wait for RDR 2 to come out on PC......which it better or I'll get my girl Kassandra to shove a spear up Rockstar's butt.Overall Score: 8/10 I'm ONLY giving this an 8 because I feel that the microtransactions and grindiness are a big turn off for current and potential players.  I do recommend that you buy this game though and ignore the microtransaction store all together.

The good game is definitely there but you should wait or refund it before they fix it... IF they fix it. Its not uncommon for companies to not change without losing on sales after all.

Aesir	Recommended	31.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/odin_rocks/	THIS IS SPARTAAA!!! ~**spams Spartan Kick Skill**Map is freakin HUGE!! You will definitely spend hundred of hours exploring. Those completionist-masochists will surely get a kick from this game.PROS:Sceneries are beautiful, the Mercenary system is a nice addition, Boat upgrading and material management, Tons of weapons and armor, Legendary armor sets and lots of customization. Choices in the game matter and some greatly affect the game world. Best example is that Blood fever quest early on. You can do romance in the game, the gender is not a problem. Flexible quests geared for more exploration. Photo Mode. SPARTAN KICK!!CONS:After playing for a while, the side quests feel repetitive. I mean theres a lot of them that sometimes I just ignore the quest boards. Alexios voice acting is boring.And Dont buy that exp booster, you dont need it. Levels dont really help in this game except for skill points and survivability on an Area with a level requirement. Mobs will adjust to your current level as well. What i noticed is that your stat and gear build matters, you need to really focus on one or two major fighting styles. Archer - Fighter - Assassin. Even on high levels, you can't really one hit assassinate a captain if your equipment doesnt focus on Assassin damage. But i do agree that the  fun starts at level 20 above, but after reaching that, levels dont matter anymore - as you have unlocked the skills you only need for your current build and theres a lot of ways to get exp in this game, aside from quests you can just explore areas or points of interests and they give exp. Main quests give a lot of exp so just do them early on to unlock all the game content.And lastly, HIGH PLACE + SPARTAN KICK = WIN!!

Less Than None	Recommended	25.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146173905/	I was 30 minutes into writing a really long and thorough review and my PC crashed (unrelate to Odyssey) , so now it's all gone. Here's the cliff notes on that review.MICROTRANSACTIONS They're not in your face and effect nothing. Just don't buy them and forget about them. And for the love of god stop ♥♥♥♥♥ing about little harmless microtransactions like this, save it for the P2W games like Battlefront 2 because that's not what this is.GRINDING You level and gain loot at a reasonable pace. You are meant to explore and do side quests in this game, if you don't then yeah, you probably won't be geared enough for some of the main quests.PERFORMANCE I have 16GB of RAM, an NVIDIA 1060 GTX, and an Intel i7~6700K CPU @ 4.00GHz.This game runs my CPU into the ground. I can have almost nothing else open when I'm playing this game. This is however the only issue I have performace wise aside from averaging around 40 FPS with a high of 68 and low of around 30.IS IT FUN (disclaimer: I wrote way more than this in the original review but it was all lost when my PC crashed) Yes it is. This game is VERY fun. Abilities are useful and invite different playstyles, there are multiple ways to approach quests, and the world is massive and full of things to do that go beyond "go here get this" or "go here kill that"CLOSING THOUGHTS I whole heartedly reccomend this game to anyone who is a fan of the AC franchise or just of RPG's in general. Just make sure you have a PC that can run it. Maybe look up how it runs on console and get it there if the performance reviews are any better.P.S. If enough people care (doubtful) I might go back and rewrite the review I wanted to make.

++	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970339445/	The game seems to have a giant open world - the intro alone lasted 6 hours for me.. The world is beautiful, but not very dense with exciting stories so far. Most typical game mechanics known from other similar games are included and work quite well: climbing, riding, sailing, personal enemies. Combat is easy going, but the RPG elements fall quite flat. The item/crafting system is very simple. The greek setting is really well done. I didn't had bothered with microtransactions up to now - they will probably force you to by them later at them point. Overall the game is a bit expensive and a bit shallow but if you like running around in a giant, beautiful and open world you will enjoy it.

Snout	Not Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998988905/	This is not assassins creed anymore. Just like in Black Flag there is a lot of naval misisons going on which has nothing to do with stealth which was once the core element of assassins creed. What the hell does being an assassin have to do with being the captain of a ship??Also there are those tedious Conquest Battles which are essentially one big slaughter without any tactical or stealth emelents. Especially if you are skilled for stealth and not confronting your enemies.Unfortunately I can't return the game anymore since I have played it for too long (the beginning is pretty good, so I was fooled by the first 2 hours, exploring the world and playing stealtily, but it forces you to go in weapons blazing later on). Otherwise I would definitely return this game. Don't get me wrong, it's a decent game, it's just not as fun as its predecessors and I will keep playing since I paid 60 bucks for it. But as soon as the first playthrough is done I will probably never touch this again.
Debjit_M	Not Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/debjitmukherjee/	 Review from a former Ubisoft fanboy. Hold on a minute... this is  not   Assassin's Creed  !It's like Assassin's Creed: Origins but  without the Assassins and the Creed. I'm keeping it short because I'm trying hard not to get triggered on this review. Check out my Assassin's Creed: Origins review to understand what's on my mind.  Review link.  I think that review is quite relevant for this game as well. How to unlock Uplay Club Rewards for  some  of their games:  It doesn't matter if you've bought the Ultra Limited Special Rare Deluxe Collectible Ultimate Super Edition 9000. You have to visit Ubisoft's game booth at every E3 event and play all the games there.What's that? You live in the other side of the World? Well then.. no rewards for you!You have to participate in their Closed Alpha Tests, Open Alpha Tests, Closed Beta Tests, Open Beta Tests of their game.What's that? You weren't selected by them to be a tester? Well then... no rewards for you!You have to own several other Ubisoft games on the same account.What's that? You don't have the money and not interested in those other games? Well then... no rewards for you! Shame on you Ubisoft for ruining the Assassin's Creed series.

Shakira	Not Recommended	9.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127512116/	Odyssey is nothing short of excellent. This game shamelessly combines 3 of some of the best games ever made: The Witcher 3, TES5 Skyrim, and AC Black Flag. At first I hated how the franchise has turned into something it wasn't before. I skipped (refunded) Origins because the stealth sucked and I hated how the game just blatantly copied Witcher 3 and called it an AC game. In Odyssey, stealth is very viable and satisfying. Odyssey combines the beauty, stealth, naval warfare, and grindiness of AC Black Flag, with the RPG elements of Witcher 3 and Skyrim such as: choices matter, take sides in war, your own horse (they might as well have just called it Roach), TONS of side quests and areas to explore (the map looks very similar to Witcher 3), romance options, excellent graphics (Witcher 3), the user interface of Witcher 3, and more. Not to mention an enormous map... Although I hate how Ubisoft is just copying games (specifically Witcher 3) and calling it their own new product, but I cant deny that I LOVE THIS GAME. Its basically Witcher 3 with viable stealth mechanics, a bigger and more beautiful world, and naval combat.The game runs great on my gtx 970, core i7 6700k rig on "Very High". Its crashed one time so far which was annoying but Im like 5 hours in so its not a deal breaker.Imho most of the negative reviews make zero sense. I highly recommend this game.

I don't think an assassin looks like a berserker.  You surely can do alot of damage but.... the enemy is just tanky as hell. Even an aggresive dog on the road has around 120k health..... You have 60k health in the end game, with 9000 Armor, 8000 meleedamage, 10k range dmg and 63k assassin dmg. IDK why ubisoft's game now has so many fancy numbers.... Plus the male character runs like a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥dwarf...

I thought, they'd be similar, but Odyssey could be a brand new IP.It's very strong inspired by the Witcher 3 and it almost FEELS like I m playing the Witcher again,but that's not a bad thing.I like the new aspects of the game and I m looking forward to play it more.
GeisterSchnitter	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198132739012/	To check out my full review, click here..... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkow-aZvhj8&t=61s    Assassin's Creed Odyssey is by no means better than the rest of the series. Dispite what critics are saying. It really feels like a reskin of Origins with some new added features that make it feel more like the witcher, 300, and shadow of war. Not saying that is a bad thing, but if your wanting a more traditional Assassin's Creed game, then you may be disappointed with this game. The most disappointing features are the microtransactions, boring story, and corny dialogue. Other than that, the combat feels fixed and looks and runs so much better than on the PlayStation system. It basically feels like the continuation of Origins, but with new features. Check it out and it is a nice collection added to my game library.

AURazor	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198288370288/	First of all I would like to say, I have played AC since Brotherhood and this one is by far the best I've played. It did everything that Origin's did, but better.Now on to the review. Captivated from the first 30 seconds in, this could be because i'm of huge fan of this period of time, but I believe that it's a great game for new players and series returning veterans. The graphics look jaw dropping when you make your to the first synchronize location, and you feel just how massive this game world is. I'm just barely past the "intro" island if you can call it that and I can't imagine that i'm going to be anywhere close to completion until I've had 60 to 80 hours put into it, that's not counting the huge amount of side quests and locations. Easily, 150 hour game for me.On to the negitives, I think the game could use some better optimization, the texture pop in pulls me out of the experince and can be quite jarring if you sail to a new part of the world and it looks like you're standing in a green and brown mass of play-doh. Not to metion the fps can vary if you're next to a fire source or if things get hectic and you find yourself in a 300 to one battle.Overall 8.9/10

I am not gonna put down my gamepad until i finished the game. Steals a bit from witcher 3, then a bit from shadow of war and copies most of origins. what sounds bad actually feels great when played. High fun factor so its gonna be the first ubisoft game that i recommend(with origins).

Deak28	Recommended	23.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198207611609/	With only 19 hours into the game so far, I can easily say I am nowhere near half way through this game. I am loving this game a lot. Game feels great, runs amazingly on my PC. I did encounter a few crashes but nothing game breaking or stopped me from playing this and getting farther. This is a game you want to do everything and enjoy everything. I've read plenty of views people saying that leveling is too slow, etc. I am personally not having this issue. Everyone does play differently though. For me, I am usually a level ahead of every main mission. But I am doing EVERYTHING because I am someone who likes to do everything. So far I have not been disappointed it. A lot the side missions are so simple and sometimes lead to other things you didn't expect. It has been a blast so far!
[BURRITO] SQ	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120814574/	This game has been awesome so far.  I have experienced no bugs and I havnt crashed a single time.  I got the gold edition in order to play the game early and I am very impressed with the quality of this game.  In terms of content the base 60$ version will easily give you 100 hours of game play so i think the game is pretty solid on content.  The graphics are totaly great and every area looks beautiful.  The combat feels pretty good but I wish I could use a sheild,  naval combat seems alot like black flag which was fun.  The sound track has been super nice to listen to will I explore the wilderness they did a good job with that.  The map is insanely large and after the amount of time i put in to the game there is still 85% of the land part of the map to explore.  Although I usually dont like ubisoft games I have to give credit where credit is due 9.6/10.p.s. I hate micro transactions but they really dont matter in this game.  I have not felt any need what so ever to pay real money since it is a single player game pay to win is kinda not the right term, but if you are a filthy casual you can spend money to progress faster.

BlueThunder796	Recommended	49.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlueThunder796/	I love this game, Its a huge expansive world with amazing backdrops and locations to play in. Some of the areas are absolutely jaw dropping and the story on the game is even better than Origins. The game itself is better than Origins in every way.Combat is more tradtional AC with parry mechanics backThe Decision making on choices leads to new paths to go in the gameThe Broken Spear of Leonidas is way cooler than the hidden bladeAbsolutely Gorgeous game thats pretty well optimised as an Ubisoft Title.Im absolutely loving the game so far and its astonoshing how good it is. This could easily be one of the better AC titles, definetly is one of the best in the modern era, thats for sure. There is so much to do, the map is so much bigger than Origins was and its so lively and amazing at every step. Each region is unique with different colour schemes and biomes. The story itself is very well done (but i wont spoil it). The bounty hunters mechanic really makes things harder and makes you consider if stealing those drachmae is actually worth it now. In all, 10/10. I feel it could rival Witcher 3 if a few tiny tweaks were made. But its not stopping me from loving the game so much

Bobzzo	Recommended	25.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198015939568/	After 14h+ (early access) I should say the game definately worth its money. It's obvious that both AC Origins and AC Odyssey has been developed in paralel but still there are enough differences to make the new AC enjoyable.Here it is some of the new stuff:- you have now 4 slots for melee abilities and 4 slots for range abilities which you use to assign skills and use them during combat using focus as a resource- crafting system has been upgraded - you can now also add "weapon/armor perks" on each piece of gear using craftable resources - the gear itself is now more like other RPGs - more pieces , various bonuses, upgradable- combat now feels more intensive - you are now able to block attacks, not only dodge them- looting now also includes stealing with all the consequences of it- quests now have dialogue and chosable options which according to Ubi will make difference based on what you choose- the game feels the most "The Witcher"-like of all the AC games so far in terms of gameplay / quests- In terms of performance I have average 50fps playing on ultra settings and the game runs and looks beautiful on GTX1070 / 16 GB RAM / coreI7 3.4Ghz- Music / sound effects / speach - excellent as always- bugs - so far zero- difficulty - definately on hard the game offers some challenge if you decide to play Rambo style and there is even nightmare if you feel it too easy. I hope Ubi will introduce the enemy level scalability at some point as they did with AC Origins because as it seems if you do all side missions exploring , etc in a certain zone - the progress seems quite fast.In conclusion I should say the game definately worth it's money and I think it will offer many hours of nice gameplay and option for re-play (assuming it offers different endings). For maybe the first time in AC history - the characters are quite memorable, able to make choices, have background story - all the nice things you expect from a decent RPG.So  far it's 9/10 for me.

Kobra	Recommended	46.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039363975/	One of the best Assassin creed games,  Very similar to Origins,But This time the main story and side quest are atcually very good and even funny at times.if you liked Origins you will love this game, if you are a new comer to the assasin creed games and love rpgs this may be your your game.
Gunsmoke	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022044553/	Think of this game as upgraded/improved AC: Origins, that is better in every aspect. I mean seriously AC: Origins personally for me was 'meh' - yeah it was something fresh and new from last AC games but still Origins felt so rushed for me. And now Odyssey - such a fun to play game. Yes it has it's flaws - especially microtransactions - complete BS and this should be thrown away ASAP, in all games, but let's talk about pros for a start. PROS: Start of the game is great - you get to choose your character (male or female) and map exploration type - guided (if you want all map, quests and other markers placed as usual, as it was in Origins or exploration type - RPGish type, where you have to find quests, landmarks and other stuff before it's pinned to your map, even quest directions sometimes not shown, so you have to listen carefully all dialogues. Story plays well so far, I mostly did main quests so far and it's really good, characters are finally seem memorable and interesting. Dialogues options - now you can choose what to say to characters during cutscenes - some dialogues will have consequences later. Graphics are amazing - it's basically same as Origins just tweaked in some ways, but open world looks outstanding - foliage and greenery looks great, sea waves very realistically. Sound is good, about open world - wind, rain, ocean etc really well done, although some weapons could sound a bit more realistic. Lots of activities in the game, tons of quests, discovering landmarks, many different armor sets, weapons and bows, upgradable character, upgradable ship, skill tree is very well done for three different playstyles - hunter, assassin and warrior - or a hybrid. Combat is amazing - so much better than Origins or any other AC game. You have usable skills now - kicks, HP restoration, also bow skills and of course counter attacks. Bounty hunt system - some of your actions have consequences, you can't steal, randomly kill guards or attack civilians, otherwise bounty hunters will start looking for you and it requires good gear to be able to fight them. CONS: Side quests are still pretty lame - done about 15 of them already and they are pretty much the same as it was in Origins - go to camp, kill some bandits, loot some stuff, comeback to NPC for reward, that's it. It's still grindy game, you are forced to constantly loot materials, to do monotonous side quests to raise the level and to get better gear, otherwise you will be back and easily killable, and you just won't be able to proceed main story. Microtransactions - obtainable high end gear and so called "time savers" with reall money... In overall, this is really great and fun to play Assassin's Creed game with lots of actions and activities with great combat system, interesting story, lots of different weapons and gear, different playstyle skill trees and fun ship battles. Some aspects of the game are being stolen from others game (bounty hunters system pretty much the same as nemesis system in Middle-Earth, dialogue choices feels similar to Witcher game and yes, MTX ruining this game as any other, and if you refuse to get in-game content with real money you will have to grind a lot. But so far I think it's still worth the money because for it's price this game has a lot of content to offer in main game, plus season pass with DLCs and community challanges later.

Bubsy<3	Recommended	100.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bubsy32/	The game hasn't even been playable for a week and we have people complaining that they 'need' time saver microtransactions, I guess that shows the kind of impatience in this review section we're dealing with. I hate microtransactions as much as the next guy, but do you need them in this game? Coming from someone around level 40, I never felt like it was a grind and I've never been levelgated. That said, they still need to go, but they're not invasive and certainly not necessary.Other than that, I have hardly any complaints.

The story and gameplay just makes you want to keep playing and exploring all the islands on the map.. Assassins creed 2 and black flag were my favorite assassins creed games but id have to put odyssey on top besause it brings a good story like assassins creed did and black flag naval fights and open world so its a two games into one.

Kapoof	Recommended	23.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970243998/	I love the direction they're taking Assassin's Creed. They've created something that can be mentioned in the same category as The Witcher 3 or Elder Scrolls. I love that they're supporting the game through 2019 with episodic content. I'm taking my time, playing with Exploration Mode on and it's the most immersive rpg i've played in a long time. It's smart to change the series up a bit, and create these massive worlds based on real human history. First Ancient Egypt, and now Ancient Greece. GTX 1070 and i7 8700k runs (almost) Ultra for me, at 1440p. I turn Volumetric Clouds down a couple notches, and keep AA at low. Those seem to make the biggest difference in peformance, and don't really make much difference in the look of the game. It will dip to 50fps on occasion, but mostly 60+. It's one of the very best looking games ever created.Now, the game does have in-game purchases. Well, i HATE that. Charging extra money for gear, weapons, cosmetics that should just be in the game. Horrible, i wish there was a way gamers could take a stand against it, but we've been trying for years. Ever since Horse Armor in Oblvion. The uproar back then never stopped them. Not sure what will. You don't NEED to buy any of it, and I certainly won't be. But i'll be really ticked off if i never get a chance to get that Pegasus skin for the horse without having to buy it. With that out of the way.... the game itself is AMAZING. A mind bogglingly massive world. Ship battles. The best combat the series has ever seen. Kassandra is GREAT. You're given the story slowly as you go, and with each reveal i'm feeling SUPER into it. Even the sidequests introduce you to some character and their little story, to give it meaning. It's really the best of The Witcher, Elder Scrolls, a bit of Tomb Raider, with Dark Souls-ish combat. Expanded gear from AC: Origins. A really good talent tree where everything feels useful, and the choices are important (but you can respec any time you like!) Everything feels just right to me.Honestly, i can't say enough good things about AC: Odyssey. At this time, i've only got 17 hours in, but it's already one of my favorite games in a loooong time. I'm not mindlessly running from map marker to map marker like i end up doing in similar games. I feel immersed in the world. Interested in the story. Somehow, everything came together in this game and it's really pulled me in!

NoHomoThou	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nohomothou/	Great game,good story. Like that they went from normal AC to more witcher style. Would wait a couple of weeks after release to buy so you do not have to get flamed over game crashing mid quest.
Avril	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AvrilEverett/	This game is 100% worth it, amazing soundtrack, amazing gameplay, alot of collectibles, gearing, activities, etc.You'll likely get 100 of hours of gameplay out of it, I've already had 8.5 hours at this review at simply completing merely 2 zones and still not fully collecting everything or quest everything that I would want to. The story is breathtaking, the graphics even more so, definitely a must have AC game, they've done well. No crashes or glitches found so far.
Years of War	Recommended	23.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YearsOfWar/	Review after 2 hours of gameplay (will edit later on)Pros:Astonishing graphics.Catchy story.Beautifully designed world.You can play as male or female.More dialogue options than Fallout 4.2 difficult levels for exploring, the hard one, how it is supposed to be played, doesn't treat you like if you were brainless as 99% of games do.Basically AC Origins but better.You can climb Zeus♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and the character will interact with it.OMG THE WAVES.Your decisions actually AFFECT and CHANGE the world.Cons:Crashed 2 times in 30 first minutes leading to a blue screen and another time at 115 minutes. Seems that running uPlay as  admin helps but does not fix it.uPlay, actually it is the only con I have found.(Seems that the crashes are fixed, not sure yet tho)

null	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198280390284/	gud
Gunsmoke	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022044553/	Think of this game as upgraded/improved AC: Origins, that is better in every aspect. I mean seriously AC: Origins personally for me was 'meh' - yeah it was something fresh and new from last AC games but still Origins felt so rushed for me. And now Odyssey - such a fun to play game. Yes it has it's flaws - especially microtransactions - complete BS and this should be thrown away ASAP, in all games, but let's talk about pros for a start. PROS: Start of the game is great - you get to choose your character (male or female) and map exploration type - guided (if you want all map, quests and other markers placed as usual, as it was in Origins or exploration type - RPGish type, where you have to find quests, landmarks and other stuff before it's pinned to your map, even quest directions sometimes not shown, so you have to listen carefully all dialogues. Story plays well so far, I mostly did main quests so far and it's really good, characters are finally seem memorable and interesting. Dialogues options - now you can choose what to say to characters during cutscenes - some dialogues will have consequences later. Graphics are amazing - it's basically same as Origins just tweaked in some ways, but open world looks outstanding - foliage and greenery looks great, sea waves very realistically. Sound is good, about open world - wind, rain, ocean etc really well done, although some weapons could sound a bit more realistic. Lots of activities in the game, tons of quests, discovering landmarks, many different armor sets, weapons and bows, upgradable character, upgradable ship, skill tree is very well done for three different playstyles - hunter, assassin and warrior - or a hybrid. Combat is amazing - so much better than Origins or any other AC game. You have usable skills now - kicks, HP restoration, also bow skills and of course counter attacks. Bounty hunt system - some of your actions have consequences, you can't steal, randomly kill guards or attack civilians, otherwise bounty hunters will start looking for you and it requires good gear to be able to fight them. CONS: Side quests are still pretty lame - done about 15 of them already and they are pretty much the same as it was in Origins - go to camp, kill some bandits, loot some stuff, comeback to NPC for reward, that's it. It's still grindy game, you are forced to constantly loot materials, to do monotonous side quests to raise the level and to get better gear, otherwise you will be back and easily killable, and you just won't be able to proceed main story. Microtransactions - obtainable high end gear and so called "time savers" with reall money... In overall, this is really great and fun to play Assassin's Creed game with lots of actions and activities with great combat system, interesting story, lots of different weapons and gear, different playstyle skill trees and fun ship battles. Some aspects of the game are being stolen from others game (bounty hunters system pretty much the same as nemesis system in Middle-Earth, dialogue choices feels similar to Witcher game and yes, MTX ruining this game as any other, and if you refuse to get in-game content with real money you will have to grind a lot. But so far I think it's still worth the money because for it's price this game has a lot of content to offer in main game, plus season pass with DLCs and community challanges later.

Levsque	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Levsque/	Don't buy if you don't have a good processor. AMD based game. It isn't hard graphically, and really doesn't suck hard, but I am pretty sure that they decided to do the oh so overused idea of dotting the edge of hair to make it look "nice".It ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.My GTX 1080 FOUNDER EDITION,  YES, A ♥♥♥♥ING FOUNDERS EDITION, is ONLY BROUGHT TO HALF CAPACITY on all of its 8 gb of vram, on all max settings.Amazingly enough, on an i7-6700k, I get 45 frames of gameplay. Even when I turn it down I only cap at 60 on a 144hz limiter.I want to love Assassin's Creed, but I can't give any real reason to continue when they keep making these dumpster fire framerate games. Nobody want's to buy a brand new motherboard and expensive CPU just to play a $60 dollar game.Understand this you complete and utter fruitcakes.This is also chapter based as I have been told, so it is getting released like hitman, making me wonder if they have actually completed anything, considering this game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥

Steeltooth	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JDgenerate/	I've played it enough to know it's definitely a good game. I wouldn't call it better or worse than Origins because at its core it's essentially the same game, just with some added things you've already seen in past games, like a 1:1 copy of the ship combat from AC4 and reducing threat levels in regions so you can take on the big boss (which is still just a big guy with a big weapon like before). It still has that horrible slow motion on detect thing from Origins that doesn't enhance the game at all and is just a terrible game mechanic all around. And unfortunately you still can't turn it off.Two things I'll say about the game is the combat is more active and engaging, if still plenty button mashy and the underwater areas are leagues ahead of what you got in Origins. There're plenty more little enhancements but I didn't find any of them to be particularly noteworthy. I guess having a large portion of the loot items be marked as having to steal them is kind of cool. I find the combat to be somewhat easy despite reports to the contrary. It's just not that hard to parry and dodge your way through a horde of enemies. The hardest part is remembering which skills you have assigned to which buttons. I thought Origins was hard until you overleveled. I'm glad they took overleveling out of this game.They seem to have taken it out that you can call your horse in a hostile zone to make a quick getaway, which I think is a bad change.Also if you use minimal or disabled HUD then photo mode is broken. As in you can take pictures but it doesn't show you any of the photo options. Turning on any of the deactivated HUD options doesn't fix it. Even if you choose minimal HUD then turn everything back on it doesn't fix it. You actually have to have show all or light selected. If you want minimal or disabled HUD to work with photo mode then you have to choose show all or light then turn off all the HUD option you don't want. Isn't that weird?All in all I'm happy with my purchase.
Afjell	Recommended	36.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035367075/	Its like origins, but with better parkour, "swifter" assassination animations and you have ships! Most of the RPG elements are really good for example: Choices (do they matter¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ?)  truly open world, you dont need to start a quest to finish it, when you look out to the horizon you can see giant ship battles. Personally i dont like some of the abilities that come with the RPG but they are easily avoidable, if you dont want teleportation abilities, just dont use/unlock them 4Head. You dont have a hidden blade, however i feel like this is a better stealth game because the AI communicate better and you can just hide in a bush and get free assassinations if the enemy knows you are there
БредСивойКолбасы	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/celphirio/	I used to hate Assassin's Creed. Ever since #3, it just seemed like Ubi was pulling a new one out of their @ss every year. Black Flag was okay, but it wasn't anything to write home about. Unity and Syndicate had cool settings, but couldn't keep my attention past the intro sequences. Once the abortion that was the movie came out in 2016, I gave up hope. But then Origin rolled around, and I had a great time. If you like Origin, you'll love Odyssey. It's similar, without being a copy-and-paste. It improves on a lot of things, and it was worth a day-one buy.Pros:-The dialogue is much more interesting now. You feel a bit more in control. Even if the voice acting and script is the same nonsense that AC has always had, I felt like I was actually involved in the story, and could change it with my decisions. And there was a surprising amount of nuance. They keep it simple, but you get the option to lie, persuade, intimidate, and ask for more information. Sometimes it had some pretty cool consequences, as well. There was one awkward but still enjoyable scene where Alexios can either woo a woman into bed with him, add her to his crew, or say goodbye to her forever. In summary, I actually care about dialogue now, and it does seem to actually change the story, even if the change is not drastic. -The story is a lot more compelling that previous titles. It's not amazing, and it comes with its fair share of problems. But it's a step in the right direction. -Sea Battles are AMAZING. They are a tad bit buggy, and the rowers have an embarrassingly limited endurance. You can have them row for 4 seconds at first, before they peter out. I believe this can be upgraded. Anyway, I thorougly enjoyed the sea battles. Ramming was very satisfying, as well as boarding. It could be annoying because sometimes only a handful of your men come onboard the enemy ship, and when they die you're on your own. Some people have said it gets boring, but so far I love it.-Like I said, Odyssey is quite similar to Origins, mostly so in the graphics. Similar building designs, similar rock formations, similar fort and bandit hideout arrangements. However, there was a noticeable graphical update, especially in regards to the character models and the lighting. I took screenshots of some of the characters during cutscenes because they looked DAMN good. Where Origins did a wonderful job showing how beautiful the desert can be, Odyssey shows how beautiful blue ocean, beaches, and bright green forests can be. There are some absolutely breathtaking moments throughout the game. This is definitely the most beautiful Assassin's Creed game so far, and probably one of the most beautiful open world games I have seen to date (as far as nature and the ancient world/fantasy goes).-Something Origin lacked was big battles. Now, with the focus of Odyssey being weakening the Greek state controlling an area, there's the opportunity for a huge battle once you finish all the main quests for that area. -Combat has improved. It feels a bit more streamlined and less frustrating. The main character is more responsive. The skill tree has been altered slightly, so now you have abilties that can be activated for a short time, such as poison, shieldbreaking, and so on. They even added a few cool little bits, such as your character giving a final stab to a victim when confirming a kill.-On top of that, you know have non-lethal stealth options. You can choke someone out, rather than kill them. This gives you the option of recruiting them to your ship's crew.-The game ran pretty damn well from day one. The settings didn't automatically adjust for my hardware, but with a few changes I had this thing running on Ultra-high at 1080p on my 1080, with a consistent 50-60 fps. -A small thing I noticed is that the AI will actually duck away from arrows and hide over cover. This is a nice little detail, and even if it's the only improvement, I like it.-It really feels like a war-torn world. You can  feel the negative effects of the war. Certain areas belong to certain factions, and there are frequent quests involving food shortages, refugee crisis, bandit robbery, etc. With the dialogue options, you can now choose if you will do what you can to spare the innocent, or you can choose to take advantage everywhere you go. Cons: -Even though the dialogue interaction has changed, the dialogue is still mostly garbage. Sad, considering many of these new character models look wonderful.-Same bugs as before with the horse, running into everything and being an absolute retard when I call for him. Now there's a new bug (perhaps it's not, someone feel free to clarify) where the horse slows down to a canter anytime he's within 25 meters of a town or stronghold. This is annoying as hell. I want to get to my destination faster, or I want to run away from a bounty hunter, and I can't.-The AI are the same for the most part, but now they have super-vision. This may be a bug that will be fixed after the first patch, I hope. Several times it seems like they saw me through walls, and there were quite a few bugs where I couldn't do a leap assassination or a stealth attack. -On top of idiot AI, they cannot tell when you are with them or against them. Once, a group of Athenians attacked a Spartan camp. I came in to help, took a few swings at Athenians, and in the process accidentally hit a Spartan. WHen they finished with the Athenians, they all came after me. I had to flee the camp and hide in the bushes until they calmed down. When I came back, they didn't recognize me. -The exploration mode is cool, but to truly appreciate it you have to remove the HUD as well. It looks nice, and it was satisfying to find a place just from the description that someone gave you. The problem is, it sometimes means that finding the place is near impossible. Not because you're doing it without hints, but because the directions are unclear. I'm having a ball with this game, and this is coming from someone that hated AC almost religiously for years. Ubisoft has really earned back some of my trust, even if at the end of the day they're a cash cow. At least now we can say they are an honest cash cow. My only concern is that with the success of Origin and Odyssey, they'll just start reskinning the experience, and then we'll see nothing but a repeat of what AC has been ever since #2. But if they can incrementally improve these games, then I will gladly purchase the next title.Highly recommended! If you do everything, then you really will hit 100+ hours on this thing.
Venomous Cuirassier	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034908515/	AC Odyssey controls and feels much the same as AC Origins, which is not a bad thing. The combat feels a bit more involved than the traditional counter-move based of older titles. So far I haven't really found much to link it to the AC universe other than a short outside of the Animus section, which again, is not a bad thing since it hasn't taken away from the game in any way and lets you start exploring the world almost straight away. Looks beautiful and has run smoothly for me, like handling, graphics are similar in quality to AC Origins, although a little more varied colour palette given the location for the setting. I very much like the ancient Greece setting and how the game presents itself so far, overall positive experience thusfar!
Gormander	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gormander/	A great game. Still has the feel of the old assasin cread combat but the fresh new take on the game with the awesome time in history that its set it makes it a great buy if your looking for an addicting single player game.

★LilPeep★	Recommended	18.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobkhalifa/	Great game, so far so good, love it, game is almost the same as origins, but this one is better. Love it.
Victorious	Recommended	27.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arathoren_Victorious/	WoW
PRIV4TE	Recommended	41.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/priv4te/	The best AC so far. Origins was really good. But Odyssey was expanded in it's every aspect. Better story, better combat system, new gear system, massive battles, naval battles are back, new orc mercenary system and tons of gameplay. You're definately don't want to miss this game.
Icreaka	Recommended	21.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Icreaka/	So far:+ really interesting main story (finnaly some new plot from Ubi)+ great sidequests (you can clearly see they took some notes from other great games)+ game is really big and will offer great value+ naval combat is back~ If you are not action RPG / AC fan the game does not make anything groundbreakingly new- Performance is meh (volumetric clouds can DESTROY up to 30% of your FPS)
Deak28	Recommended	23.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198207611609/	With only 19 hours into the game so far, I can easily say I am nowhere near half way through this game. I am loving this game a lot. Game feels great, runs amazingly on my PC. I did encounter a few crashes but nothing game breaking or stopped me from playing this and getting farther. This is a game you want to do everything and enjoy everything. I've read plenty of views people saying that leveling is too slow, etc. I am personally not having this issue. Everyone does play differently though. For me, I am usually a level ahead of every main mission. But I am doing EVERYTHING because I am someone who likes to do everything. So far I have not been disappointed it. A lot the side missions are so simple and sometimes lead to other things you didn't expect. It has been a blast so far!
Samzon	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198170062751/	Better than origins and thats saying something!                   Some times the world can feel empty but otherwise very fun!

Shadowkiller324	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shadowkiller324/	This game is outstanding, I havent played a good assassin's creed game in a while (Mind you i skipped out on origin but i may go back). There are only 2 problems that I have had witht his game.     1. The ship mechanic feels kinda lazy, but honestly thats fine I don't care to much about that.and     2. Every now, and then when I die or "desynchronize" the game just goes black and never loads, forcing me to stop the game with task manager, and restarting it.
Alicée	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2289076850/	Truly excellent Assassin‘s creed for playing with so much elements , sea battles also like the Black flag as it was ,even better if it can hunt whales just like the Black flag . Various kind of missions rich the experience of playing .This one integrates almost all of the forms of playing of the Assassin's creed 's series before .For last , many players say the Assassin's Creed is not going to be the assassin any more , i just want to say , if you want to be an assasin, just update your skills for assasin you'll find the original taste of ASSASSIN'S CREED , never trying to be a fighter just be an assassin as you like .......Looking forward to seeing the Assassin's creed making better and better !

BarackOshizzle	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/barackoshizzle/	It's a good game. The character controls well, the map looks sizable and decent, the story even this early on is nice, the voice acting is decent.Dont worry too much, from what i can tell, most complaints are either about performance or the reviewer's weak willpower leading them to use the store because spending time is too much for them.
Embatej	Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152617231/	When I start the game I can play it for like 10 minutes and then it crashes. Do not know what to do with it. If the problem persists, I would like to get my money back. If anybody has any recommendation on how to fix it I would be glad to hear it. Thanks

CommanderWyro	Recommended	26.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087460557/	i honestly like this game a heck of a lot more than origins. feels the same but they also made it better which is nice. people are saying that the optimization is trash but my 1080 and i7-4790k is getting 70 fps. only frame drops are in the town but even then its aroung 55-60

[★] ak47communist	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010054628/	This game is amazing. 10/10.1. Highly detailed characters, beautiful scenery, the most amazing level design artwork I have ever seen. 2. The gameplay graphics are identical to cutscene graphics rendered at maximum quality.3. Action combat gameplay is great and requires some tactics. You can't just mash buttons to win fights. 4. Exploring this world is fun on its own. The only slight negative thing I can say about this game, is the slightly excessive profanity at totally unnecessary times. I know this is weird coming from me since I use profanity in real life, but I only use it when there is a valid reason to, it just seems like they threw it in to make the dialogue more appealing to the young who enjoy swearing a lot, as for me I guess I am getting old and going soft and starting to slow down on swear words.

Hairy Potter	Not Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120090065/	So... I bought this game. I'm quite disappointed to be honest. Having played AC Origins I feel AC Odyssey is a copy/paste of AC origins: the maps are quite the same as AC origins (of course they removed the pyramids, the sphinxes and added some grasses and greek Gods to fool the user but yet it's very similar to AC origin maps...) Cassandra's accent is really awful and a torture for my ears... I feel the maps are dead: in AC origins I used to enjoy seeing the civilians on their daily lives. On Odyssey they seems to have removed a lot of civilians.. The colors ingame are so vivid and unrealistic, looks like I am playing Fortnite. Lot of fps drops (on a 1080 GTX 8Gb and 16Gb Ram I get fps drops to 9FPS on a 1920x1080 resolution and ultra high) to end. At the end I feel I bought a witcher game and not an assassin creed franchise.. This RPG style was ok on AC origins but it really disappoint me on Odyssey. Odyssey is not an assassin creed at all.. Yet I will complete the game because I paid £49 for it but I am really disappointed
Villy	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VillyExo/	FOR SPARTAAAA!!!! (Kick) Yes, you can literally kick people in this game or take their shields and smack them. 11/10
drososkardulias	Recommended	43.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068057561/	Finally, a game that features Greek voice actors portraying their own history. Good on Ubisoft for doing this right. As for the actual game- souls/shadow of mordor-esque combat, Mass Effect/Witcher character interactions, Witcher 3 world design, and a truly unique scope and level of detail make this easy game of the year contender in my book. Seeing the ruins of ancient Korinth or Athens as they were during the fifth century BC is nothing short of breathtaking. Story is gripping with genuine emotion and excellent voice and motion capture.Overall, can't recommend enough.

Vivian	Recommended	16.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vuhdo/	Its hard to truly recommend a game when just now hitting the 10 hour play mark but I do feel like some review is needded at this point due to a investment time frame most games don't reach.Odyssey does a lot right, and I mean  a lot. I consider it at this point Origins 2.0 with better combat, better enviroments, better gameplay and just over all a more positive experience. The new mercenary system has actually given me wores as I sit in the middle of a fortress with 4 of them searching every corner of it just for me -- giving a sense of tension and relief as the fortress is eventually cleared. The world is even more beautiful than Origins. I'd put it on par with Witcher 3's world. Just countless lush forests, open plains, creeks, lakes, rivers, mountians. It is jaw dropping just running through it as you crouch in a forest waiting to assassinate someone and the leaves fall around you as the moon hits the small lake to your side lighting up a shallow meadow. Words do not do justice here. I am playing on Ultra settings while keeping a stable 60fps (I did turn down Volmetric Clouds down by 1 since that had a huge impact). The, world, is, stunning. Combat feels so much more fluid and dangerous. I have died more in Odyssey then all assassin's creed games combined (Origins, Original AC). The kicker is I've been trying for 99% stealth and I just keep messing it up. No longer can you whistle in the middle of 20 guys and 1 by 1 they come to investiage. Whistle and 3 are near you? They're on gaurd and watching their friend as he comes over. Mercs are extremely dangerous if you're just a smidge level below them -- worse when the fortress is on alert because you killed a leader. I love ancient greek culture just as much as egypt. Which is why Odyssey and Origins were day 1 buys for me. So far? Haven't been burnt by origins purchase and by the looks of it. Odyssey won't dissapoint me ether. So much positivity however, there are multiple negatives as well.-Assassination is very problematic due to a lot of enemies shrugging it off. Origins had a minor problem of this but eventually got out leveled by dagger damage. Odyssey does not, you will always be out of a disadvantage on damage thus making true assassinations hard to pul off. My only suggestion is to clear all normal soldiers/bandits out, then attempt a assassination (And fail) and prepare for combat then. Odyssey is very warrior heavy, you go in, bash and dash and not so much as sneak and peak-Microtransaction in a $60 AAA game. Its Ubisoft. This is not a surprise. Its still stupid-DRM, because lets punish people who actually buy the game. -Some dialogue choices come with surprising twists that you would not of expected. For example, one choice I thought "Hey thats helpful! This would really be impactful and good for them" "YOU ♥♥♥♥ING WHAT MATE? I'LL HAVE YOUR HEAD FOR THIS". I've come across a few like this. -Requires uPlay even if purchased on steam-Day -1 DLC. There was DLC before the game was even released. That is just depressing to think about when you make a billion dollars a year and yet still need that urge to squeeze as much money as possible on top of a $60, DRM, AAA  game. Overlay? Like Origins? You'll love Odyssey. Has some gameplay elements from black flag as well such as naval combat and upgrading of the ship. I can see myself playing this for a while as I attempt to atleast get near 90% of the total game. Enjoyable experience to say the least.

Sandusson	Recommended	10.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sandusson/	I like it. You won't run 144fps and you will encounter bugs, but it's honestly a great exploration RPG if you can ignore some flaws. It's easy to just go "it's trash" because it isn't super optimized but there's a good game hiding under there.

Chex_Mix_	Not Recommended	486.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198084698537/	I've wasted too much time on this game, the devs are too woried about skins then they are about the fluidity of gameplay. They would rather the game look older and play worse, than to fix problems they already have. Maybe they've made steps in the wrong direction, or maybe they don't see the game's path in the same way the players do. Either way, they don't listen to their community unless it will make them more money.

Anticheat system makes me laugh.It's been a year from the launch of H1Z1 with battleroyale now chopped into King of the Kill and Just survive. Just to make more money. It's soo obvious hunger they have for money that they not only did this, they are giving more priority into creating new crates and skins to sell to dumb people instead of fighting the high amount of cheaters in this game.

Nell	Not Recommended	222.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AnotherBlackGamer/	What makes a game good? Free content? Something we have never played before? Or maybe even developers listening to the community? And what can go wrong?H1Z1 went wrong....Before "H1Z1" was...well..."Just Survive" there was H1Z1. Through here, we had another game were we can travel searching for loot and fandom, making Allies and enemies alike, and simply RDM. For me, it was a train away from the DayZ hype. Heck, before PUBG, it was DayZ VS H1Z1. And it's funny because they all branched from Arma, yet, H1Z1 for some reason stuck out, with their on...Battle-Royal. This would take place in Z1 with over 150+ players. It was 'INSANE'. Jumping over peers, Dolphin Diving, Two bullets to kill, and "Shotgun rushing." These few elements kept people on their toes, unless they were getting shot under the car. This started my love for H1Z1. I would practice day and night trying to get high kills. I remember thinking 18 kills was legendary, until I discovered the insane channels like StormenTV, DrDisrespect, Ninja, And even good old LyndonFPS, it was clear to me...I had to get better. I'd practice when my friends were even off, rush everyone, tried copying these top tier gods. If Stormen would no scope someone from med-range I'd practice that, when Doc jumped over the enemies just to one-pump them I'd camp doors for days. When I discovered two-taps, I became a God! But of course things took a twist for the worst!H1Z1 decided to branch out, moving to a new reddit, and making H1Z1 into H1Z1: Kotk. Things started to change without question, losing half the animations that we became so familiar with, removing out-playable situations. Instead of being able to jump over people it like crazy it was nerfed for a more stiff yet set to the ground type character. The odd body removements I remember laughing at everytime I died were gone. And follow was Z2 replacing Z1. This started a whole war inside the H1Z1 community with people picking sides, some vouching for the new maps and others...not too sure. This caused people to beg for Z1, and with Just Survive being introduced it started a uproar for those veterns. However, Pre-season 2 and 3 felt like humble times. The color popped, there was such a shift in skill with the new map. And people began to try and master it all, with people landing in big cities to gear up and camp the roofs while try-hards played Need For Speed while honking their horns. People would either jump out full speed to land insane Two-taps or get one-pumped by a shotgun, roof campers shooting the survivers and window watchers popping out of apartments from left to right. I would remember the rage and joy when people would win in ridiculous ways. I remember I'd shoot someone 5 times with a shotgun and would lose to their one-pump and curse the heathens out of them all! I have even gotten a game ban due to ReShade not being able to be used. I didn't care. I would repurchase H1Z1 and make new friends, Recieve new skins, even able to win a Pig mask and sell it for an upgrade on my GPU. It was my love, my life. And it has failed not only me...but us.As time proceed, we have gotten nothing but updates we didn't ask for, Hit-reg feeling more and more deluted, and players crying that their one pumper-runie didn't do it's job and ending up with them costing their life. We would take a shift into bullet drop changing, making people rage at the fact that they'll have to re-learn, and learn until they are sick of it all.What followed next...is the down fall of H1Z1: KotkWith their "NEW COMBAT UPDATE!" At this time, let us face it, PUBG was being hyped by streamers and created a path to a whole new experience. But why would I enjoy that? I remember the barbaric frame-rate and Potato loading buildings, and besides why would I'd like to play a game where after I get nothing but a pistol I get sniped in a mere second? Sticking with H1 was well worth it until this new Combat update. Concerns of the Old Ar-15 pattern being spammable was to be replace with a whole new model of an AR, Bullet drop, Recoil, Spread, and even the look of it was re-worked. The community felt a painful joy. It was all looking gorgeous on paper and by the next week, it was pushed to Test servers. This caused the depression of this game, some were positive while most knew this might be the end of H1Z1. Despite the New Ar, Ak, And new MP7, instead of doing what it was told it was doing the exact opposite! People would spam the Ar, the AK, And lets not forget the lazer, MP7. The game felt even more buggy, There was no bullet drop, barley leading, the Ar, even more spammable at a farther range. I remember spraying the AK and hitting unthinkable two taps. And the community wasn't just raged, but scared for the big changes coming to H1Z1...And it came. With different type of nerfs applied, and almost new everything with a crazy amount of POIs the game started to lose fandom. I remember seeing 9k playings being lost each month, this has started the decline.Seeing "H1Z1: Kotk" and "H1Z1" Becoming "H1Z1" and "Just Survive" started the death of the game.With Just Survive having their own problem, H1Z1 originality has started to shift, even ideas of adding scopes, and silencers where brought up with the community shutting it down. With the new Combat Update pros has branched to different games such as PUBG, and later on Fortnite. H1Z1 losing it's hype and slowy dying, each update ruining the game, bringing the fandom to rage. Even though we wanted to try something new it has back fired, with every update being directed by the community being hated afterwards, the game kept digging it's own grave. With all the big names disappearing and H1Z1 searching for the next big update, it was clear to see the direction of this product. Players quitting monthly in persuit for better games, skins losing it's price, and even the China ban hit H1 with many more problems. With only a handful who would stay.Yet, even when they started listening to us at the end, this started the "Loop." DayBreak would add something to revert it back, The new Ar replaced with the old spray pattern with adjustments, Z1 being re-worked even they would refuse to ever bringing it back. Movement, like Jumping over people, or Instantly Proning being brought back, things we had which is now making a comeback too late. Why would the aspect of the game change if we'd get them back later on? It didn't make sense, and people saw that. With the progression questionable it was even time for even veterns to finally make their way to better titles.H1Z1 has finally plummeted, The game feels terrible, Movement is restricted, You have to gamble for hit-reg, and games sometime starting up with only 70 players. Waiting went from a few seconds to a few minutes. It was starting to feel deserted. The same faces each game and less of them daily. and with the last change to bullet drop and couldn't take it anymore. I've lost all the knowladge I've learned, the old me has vanished, and even new players would consider me as a noob. It was clear to see, that my time has come aswell.Turning back at the times I've spent hiding from teams, crafting make-shifts, and popping off helments, made me realize that I might never feel such a rush for action, such a thrill shift in gameplay, and the funny jolts that I'd spend with friends. It's very clear to me, DayBreak has pulled a Planetside 2 on me, This was the 2nd time I've felt such a big lost in such an odd community. The shifting of games isn't even just for me. I really can never feel the same compared to what I've gone through in Z1 and Z2. And I feel many have felt the same, we all held hope for the game to jump back just to see it fall down each leap, and with the current state being worked on just to meet the need of the now player base I cannot recommend this game. I'd always have my saved videos...but will never have the same game in them.

Meliodas	Not Recommended	286.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darialpub/	After almost spending my entire life (almost 1000 hours, including the original H1Z1) here is my final review for you guys.It all began 2015, where the glorious H1Z1 has been released. At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game.Though it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course.At this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group. Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group. So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days.After the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games     ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the game was on their way to fall down.You couldn't see any progress in developing, major bugs existed for months, the priority list of Daybreak Games was disastrous. Well though I had those bad impressions, I wasn't missing the fun at this time. In 2016 they made the decision split the game into two. H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. I had hope in the developement of this game again, because I thought maybe it will help them to organize themselfs better and to set priorities.On one side I was happy that they brought some new stuff, new gamemodes to play, events, etc., like Ignition, Skirmish, Green Dawn, Hardcore, but on the other side major bugs still existed. But for me, it was still fun to play.Later 2016 they have made their biggest mistake. They (re)-"launched" their game (fun-fact: its still in early-access) and promised a major change in gameplay, graphics, performance and developing. So let's see what the "launch" brought us:(1) They have removed the old map and replaced it with the new Z2-Map. You might ask yourself now, what, is so bad about the new Z2-Map?:- Though they promised graphic enhancements, they've just increased the color saturation, to pretend, that graphics are better now. But as you might guess: They are not even close to better. The lightnings in the buildings are worse then ever. You can hardly see the loot inside of the buildings.- The actual reason for why the map was changed was that the devs thought, that the original map was maybe a bit too much copy and pasted. Here is my opionion on that: The new map is even more copy and pasted. Almost every buildings looks the same.- There are no real memorial places or fighting spots, like they were on the original map. Maybe it is because that I am a little bit nostalgic, but people who have played the original H1Z1 will understand me, when I rave about PV Police-Station, Radio-Tower, Opfer Camp, Reservoir Dam, B2, Hospital, etc, etc...- Loot is clipping inside of the textures so you cannot pick it up. This bug exists since almost half a year now.- Floating trees and ugly streets and textures are daily fare.- They won't give us the opportunity to play the old map, since they "deleted it by mistake" so they said. (Another fun-fact: the old map is still available in H1Z1: JS, so there is no way that it had been deleted)- There is no pit in the new Box of Destiny. Where the hell shall summit go then?(2) They have made a major change to the Interface and the HUD, which in my eyes clearly looks fancier but is actually worse than the original, because it seems really unclearly to me.(3) The translations are actually worse than google translator.(4) They have removed previous exlusive gamemodes, so you can't play them anymore. Well there is the ability to do so, but there never had been an event where you can play them.(5) They brought in a new rewards system and removed the old one. Unfortunatley, I never could experience those, because as you might noticed, I was always playing with friends. But nope, there are still no rewards for groups.(6) The performance is still as bad as in the old H1Z1.You might ask yourself now, why did they make those changes and why did they relaunch the game?Clear answer boys: to market the game more efficient.I have lost faith in this game and thats why I felt the need to write this review.I have the bad feeling that this game won't get any better, since the problem-solving approaches from the developers are slow, less efficient and mostly alternative and do not treat the cause of most problems.Edit: _______When the game was fun - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlvQDVWNsmgI will always remember you Z1. <3Shame on you greedy devs! Memories will stay, but you will fade._______Got the "Dying Game Award".Lel._______"iT'S bEcAuSE oF pUbG aNd FoRtnIte ThAT tHE pLaYeRbaSE iS LoWeRINg"

Another few months go by, and you start noticing all the things you don't like about your loyal companion anymore.

Blueberry	Not Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/123midtobanana/	I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split. I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. - The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere. - 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like "ak now is a bit less powerful" or "car speed reduced" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is "H1Z1Sucks".Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because "they wanted to focus more". Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the "Green Battle royal" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought "Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant.

I bought into H1Z1 for what it was originally supposed to be, a horror survival game; then it became an arcade shooter to turn a quick profit for another company not even involved in it's production. Once I learnt of their ill treatment of Player-Unknown, that was the only semblance of silver lining that came out of the Day Break tragedy... If they never bought out his parent company and fired him we never would have PUBG. So. I guess we can thank them for giving us PUBG as he took the money he made from H1Z1 and the Sony sale and made PUBG as a giant flipping of the bird to Day Break.

Kinoko	Not Recommended	386.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/internetfunnyman/	H1Z1 is a game I've played for over a year and a game that I've loved a lot for such a long time. It was a game that I was willing to look past the bugs and poor development team because of how much fun I had playing this game. The current state of the game, on April 11 2017, is absolutely terrible. We've been promised so many things and been given so little. We just NOW got a spectator camera. 9/10 of my games are ruined by a hacker two tapping me from a mountain. Despite all of this, I loved King of the Kill so much. I made so many friends and got close to so many people through this game, and it held a special place in my heart for that. Until today.My best friend got on to play a couple of rounds with me only to find out that she had been banned. Why, might you ask? Well neither of us have any idea whatsoever! She's not someone to care about cheating or even her rank all that much, seeing as we only played duos and fives. All of her games were very low kill counts and placings, if anything she was a very average player around Gold level. She never had an insane performance or anything like that. Today, she was banned by Daybreak Games for virtually no reason. I can not, with a clean conscience, recommend ANYBODY to purchase this game or give the developer any of your money whatsoever.Daybreak Games is a terrible company in literally every single right. The game has been early access for three years and the game has gone nowhere at all.Edit: Daybreak responded to my friend's complaint about being unreasonable banned with:"nullnullThanks!don't reply.":)

Crow	Not Recommended	1,276.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AleksanderC/	A perfect battle royale game killed by combat update which was released August 10th 2017. This game was slowly deminishing after pre-season 3 but the useless, pathetic and incompetant devs failed to see that. The development team have a mindset that "If we make it like PUBG, we will get more players" but what's the point when I can just play PUBG instead.Countless players that have enjoyed playing this game enough to accumulate over 1000 hours are being ignored. One of the Combat Update features was making bullet drop non existant which just throws all that time and effort learning this game down the drain.This was my favourite game and I used to be excited to play it... This game has come so far downhill which is just sad.  Do not play this game at all cost until the devs stick to the true H1Z1 gameplay.
Swift	Not Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tryingdutchman/	Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?-----Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :PWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?-----Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?-----With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.-----Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!

Skay (SK)	Not Recommended	1,378.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skaysk/	I've played this game for 3 years and I have to say that this game was great. This game was popular and it was really about skill. But big Mistake is that Developers don't listen to community. They don't use brain. Developers do things which ruins whole game. H1z1 has lost a lot of players. In pre season 3 this game played 150k people. Now ? 3-4-5k ? really daybreak ? Honestly I'm very sad becaused I like this game but developers don't try to listen community and that's why I decided to stop playing this game. I was really patient but developers still do the same thing!!! They don't listen to community Feedback!!!! So please guys don't play this game. Daybreak doesn't deserve our attention.

In the beginning of the alpha it was already said that the game would become free later on, and so if you buy it that would mean you pay for the development of the game. So now don't cry that you have paid 20 euros for it, you could know that this was going to happen...

Seriously though, from day 1 H1Z1 has hardly improved. There has been some 'stuff' added but they spend all their time on releasing [crates] skins for the kids. How about improving the combat mechanics and give us a game that is about PvZ and not PvK (players vs. kids). H1Z1: King of the Kill. The best copy/paste game of all time.

DOrr94	Not Recommended	435.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DOrr24/	Started out with really good potential, but was quickly squandered due to profiteering from the developer's parent company. Endless crate releases for in-game purchases instead of fixing bugs, adding content, or addressing server issues like hitreg and desync. Players from other regions use VPNs to connect to NA servers, and effectively ruin the competition. Movement is clunky, guns are inconsistent, and explosives don't work. This is a solid case for "come back when it isn't early access, and maybe then it'll be good. maybe."

Mathias	Not Recommended	785.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016704712/	This game was good before the combat update. When you ruin the whole game with new sounds, new weapons, new movements and new mechanics it's not wierd this game is going downhill. And the worst part is that there are full of cheaters in this game. You have zero controll of cheaters in this game and you are not doing anything to fix it. All the time I have put in this game for nothing. Game after game you get killed by cheaters, a bug, or simply someone frome china with 280 in ping. This game had such great potential but is now going to an end. Bye bye Daybreak, you incompetent useless bunch of morons.

^6Jm clima enevoado	Not Recommended	133.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jmclma/	08/03/2018 - After Daybreak said their game would never be F2P, because they had 2 teams, one working on KotK and the other on Just Survive, today they decided to make it F2P. Because of their promises I bought the game to play with my friends, now they give ''loot'' that my friend told me can't even be sold in the steam store, to everyone that bought the game. Daybreak didn't know how to do business management back in day and they still don't know to this day. Stay away from this game even after becoming F2P...22/02/2017 - Before telling you why the game is a no go, I have to say that I enjoy playing it with my friends its a lot a fun, we have a lot of PVP action and funny moments, but this game is glitchy as ♥♥♥♥. I will be naming the pros and cons just so you can make a decision for yourself.(*In my opinion* If you don't have any friends to play with don't buy it...)PROS:-The PVP is quite good and comparing to other BR games, its the best out there,-If you have friends it can be an emerging experience and a lot of fun.-The gun mechanics are somewhat cool.-The variety of items in the game, even though there are barely some, have some use and you will most likely like them.-Car mechanics are somewhat decent.-A lot of places to loot.CONS: (Im starting from the glitches that happen from the loading screen untill we are on the arena)-When entering the game if you have a bad connection so many glitches will happen, like not having a parachute, landing under the map, landing and then 2 seconds into the game dying to the environment, etc...-Sometimes while trying to enter a car you will receive a message saying ''Something is in the way'' and you won't be able to enter.-Jumping from a 2 feet rock will make you lose HP.-Some players either are hacking or have an amazing aim, you will see this since they hit you from over 100 meters, every single shot and this is annoying because if you stop to shoot at them you miss every shot when on the other hand they hit every single one.-When you shoot at someone, and you are sure you tagged him, after he kills you, sometimes you will see his HP at 0 but he will still be running and jumping.-Entered a jip, waited for my friend he entered aswell, turned on the engine pressed W to go foward and died to ''Disconnect''.-The bombs dropped from the plane are bad since the day I bought this game which was over a year now, if they drop on top you you probably won't die unless you have like 10 HP.-There is a rank system which im not even sure if you play against your own rank. (I was on the worst one Silver V and saw guys that would hit someone 100 meters away and 2 tap them).-There is a level system which every 5 levels you get an unlocked case and you can open them to get some clothes, we should get cases every level because on the higher ones it becomes a grind to level up.-When you finish in the top 10 you get nothing, you only win something if you bet on yourself free coins which after finishing in top 15 (I think) gets you skulls to unlock the limited clothes they have on the skull shop, and it only has like 10 cosmetics.***SIDE NOTE***The developers of this game are the worst, they only care about your money. After buying the game from SONY they decided to split the game (H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill) this was the most stupid business stunt I have ever seen in my life (Since now Just Survive has pretty much no interest to them). They did this to have a team working on Just Survive and another team working on KOTK, LOL, since Just Survive is getting little to no updates I don't think they are putting much effort into it. KOTK is pretty much a carnival party at this point, all you see is players dressed up in a huge amount of colors that make them look like ♥♥♥♥ing clowns. The KOTK game became a pay-2-dress and everytime they update the game we only see cases, little tweaks to guns and no major/game breaking glitches getting fixed. You pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) to play a game that its main focus is who looks the prettiest. Or pay 20$ (or 10$ on sale) for Just Survive to play a game that has basically no updates and the dev team doesn't really care about. In my opinion you shouldn't buy the game but after what you read you make your own decision.

Carmasaurus	Not Recommended	557.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/carmasaurus/	The fact of the matter is this is a awesome concept and scratches the right itch I had as a competitive gamer, however, Day Break Games seem to value gimick releases over actually fixing the game they have. This game has been in Early Access for years now and it still plagued by Blocker level bugs that just never get fixed. Please, vote with your dollar by spend it elsewhere. As much as I would love to see this game succeed, I cannot recommend you purchase it at this time. I firmly believe the money will not go to support this title and just be wasted by the Studio Heads who on Glassdoor are portrated as unquailified and not concerned with making great games but making a dollar.
Schwinne	Not Recommended	43.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/schwinnee/	The developers had their chance to make a great Battle Royale game, and they completely screwed it up. They sat on their underdeveloped game, pushing out updates whenever they felt like (sometimes six months in-between actual fixes, not just cosmetic updates). Then PlayerUnknowns and Fortnite came out and now they want to start adding content and fixing their game?No thanks, just get Fortnite or PUBG instead.EDIT: 10 days after the release they made the game free to play and won't give money back to people who bought the game. OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF
Asiilex	Recommended	286.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/asiilex/	 The honest and legit way on how to ALMOST win a game in H1Z1. (AFTER UPDATE)! 1. Begin by launching up the game. You will probably be forced to restart the launcher a couple of times, but it has always been like that so don't worry.2. After 35 restarts, press the SOLO button and wait 25 minutes to get into your game. 3. When finally inside the pre-game arena, make sure to scream as loud as you can and insult other players as much as possible. Perhaps let them know what size your weiner is?4. You will then be entering the game. Unfortunately you will be stuck on the loading screen, so restart the game again. But once again, it's normal. Don't freak out.5. When you finally get into the game after another hour of start up time, you will spawn without a parachute and fall to the ground. Happily you spawned next to a little camp and you found all the best loot. (No backpack, no helmet, T-shirts, golves and that ugly little pistol with the red ammo that no one uses.)6. With your loot you will hide by the trees and act like you ARE the tree, until a little noob with an AR, 5 laminated armours and a sniper rifle, casually walk past you. 7. 2-tap him with your pistol and spam C to T-bag him. 8. With your new loot, kill 30 people and record it to later on let everybody on youtube know that your are better than StormenTV.9. You are now starting to get sweaty and nervous because of the final 1v1 situation. Just as you are going to shoot your enemy with your sniper, you get a warning sign saying that your weapons will be locked due to bad internet connection. 10. Freak out, run out to your router and make sure that it's running fine.11. After finding out that nothing was wrong with your internet, run back to your computer and take a look at your screen.12. ** 2nd Place. 30 kills. **13. Get T-Bagged by the player who killed you while he brags about how good he is and how he had sexual intercourse with your granny last night.14. It should now be midnight, go to sleep. Repeat next day. Originally posted by author: Review made by Asiilex 
Rabbit シ	Not Recommended	42.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RabbitBenQ/	I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split. I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. - The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere. - 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like "ak now is a bit less powerful" or "car speed reduced" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is "H1Z1Sucks".Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because "they wanted to focus more". Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the "Green Battle royal" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought "Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant.
Sasha Darko	Not Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sashadarko/	"Purchase H1Z1 recently? Refunds will be provided by Steam in accordance with its refund policy." - Steam won't give you any refunds, checked that today.So they made the game F2P just ONE WEEK after its release, without noticing anyone. Imagine you bought it on launch, played for 2.5 hours or so. That's it, you're ♥♥♥♥ed, your 20$ are gone (and I bought it for 9.99$ when it was in Early Access).Now they're milking it with the Freemium model, and there's already a 100$ DLC. You don't create all this in just one day or so, it was all planned. An elaborate scam. NEVER buy a game from Daybreak.

Farixy	Not Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Farixy_/	H1Z1 is a Battle Royale game that started off great, but sadly lost it's mojo during the Early Access stage.The game started of as H1Z1: King of the Kill (Aka KOTK) but was later changed to just H1Z1 as the survival version of the game was renamed from H1Z1: Just Survive to Just Survive.Last week the game finally left Early Access after quite a long time, to put in perspective, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds was launched into Early Access long after H1Z1 was, and yet managed to leave Early Access about 3 months earlier. And it comes to no surprise, while PUBG has done a great job updating the game regulary, H1Z1 has had very slow updates, at times it felt like they didn't really add anything for up to 6 months. And to be honest, I get the feeling that they simply were pretty lazy, because prior to PUBG and Fortnite, H1Z1 was on top of the charts with a large and growing player base, but then PUBG came along and changed that. It's not until now that big things has started to happen with H1Z1, because now they have to compete with both PUBG and Fortnite which more or less has taken oven the world at this point. The latest big addition came when the game left early access, a gamemode called "Autoroyale" which as it sounds, is battle royale strictly using cars. The game mode was actually surprisingly fun, so I have to give them that. Now, as the playerbase started to fade away for H1Z1 they took the bold move to make the game free to play, which in a way was needed to compete. BUT, the problem with this is the fact that they did it about a week after leaving and advertising that the game is finally out of Early Access, many people bought the game just a week ago and now they made the game free to play, which is a massive kick inbetween the legs to many consumers. And I'm pretty sure this was intentional. Putting things like slow development and somewhat questionable actions aside, the game does offer some fun both by yourself or with friends. It's by no means unplayable and can honestly be a fun and more "arcade-ish" take on the battle royale genre. And as the game now is free to play there is no reason why you shouldn't give it a go, since you don't have much to lose. But overall there are better options for battle royale games out there.

Farts McCool	Not Recommended	0.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rellix2/	Do not purchase this game.  Do not support unethical price gouging.The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different.  They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay! This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab.  Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years.  With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago.  It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova.  No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers.  Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years,  at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.If your battle royale itch needs scratching, I'd recommend Rust or ARK. Both games have survival and BR modes, both are backed by more committed developers that aren't just there to separate your money from your wallet.
fredman555	Not Recommended	63.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fredman555/	Trust the bad reviews. I had several hundred hours before they "split" the game (effectivly lowering productivity by 50% and breaking several parts of the game) because i hoped and prayed that semi-frequent updates were a good sign. They wernt.Between the cheaters, glitches and all around incompletness of the game after....however many years now, i can not recommend anyone to play this game. Rather than fixing these issues, they release more microtransactions. Another example of incompetancy was when they finally claimed to fix 1 pre-game bug that was a little annoying (exploding car/tombstone); then before even releasing said update, decide to do away with the whole lobby system instead for apperantly having some massive internal revelation of a better way to have a pregame lobby. If you dont see why this is an issue, then youre probably dumb enough to play this game. This game is spinning its wheels and going absolutely nowhere. They still have the same handful of items since launch (their wiki lies and says 660, but they include airdrop tickets, emotes, and shl tty variations of the same item; like backpacks). And the worst thing? China has got their hands on it, which is the coalmine canary of video games. Anyone over the age of 15 knows that once the chineese start playing a game enmasse, its days are numbered.The company is run by morons and my harddrive feels lighter for doing away with it.

While wating the game either crashes or places me into a completely random game, disregarding the party i queued with in the lobby.The one time I made it all the way into a game with my friends, my framerate was severally more unstable then it was before the update splitting the game. The frames stuttered like my 1200$ pc was actually a 200$ laptop. This game is now broken and i will be opting out of the new updated version that brought two seperate games. I wish i could refund, as i did not buy H1Z1 Kotk or H1Z1 Just survive. I bought H1z1, a survival/battle royal game that was working its way to F2P and availability on Xbox, PS4, and PC. Instead Ive gotten a sluggish, DAYZ developement team who makes DAYZ-esque updates and slowly chokes out each and every member of the community that used to enjoy the game, who makes a F2P game 40$ and makes a skin market because 40$ isn't enough money for them to not positively develop a simple survival genre game.

Erik Sai	Not Recommended	1,323.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120650021/	I'm updating this review after several months::: I had kept a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of faith that this game would eventually be fixed and blossom like it deserved. God the idea of this game was amazing, out of any BR I've seen, this one really attracted me and had me hooked for a good year, and, quite unfortunately, Daybreak Games work their piece of art like a Stalin worked his country, doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about the people, just wants power, or in Daybreak's case, MONEY. Like god damn do they out all of their work into crates and ♥♥♥♥ing thousand dollar tournaments when their game ISNT EVEN ♥♥♥♥ING FINISHED. I still don't want to give up complete hope in this game, but since it's overall gotten worse with it's old problems like bugs and exploits, but now they're adding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ additions to the game thought up in their Cheeto dusted, Mountain Dew stained office, instead of listening to the complaints of every single player; it seriously seems like they're completely ignoring it's community and doing♥♥♥♥♥♥all by themselves. They're game is sinking in the grave, and PUBattlegrounds is rising above, with a game that isn't 100% broken,♥♥♥♥♥♥it just came out and it has a million less bugs than H1, over-exaggeration but you get the point. If Daybreak doesn't pull their heads out of their asses then all hope is lost and their company will be driven into the ground. Their's my update, take my hours into account that I know what I'm talking about that this game is dying, instead of assuming I love it and blowing this off and typing a vacuous comment saying "YOU HAVE 800 HOURS YOUR OPINION IS IRRELEVANT" while beating your shriveled 12 year old♥♥♥♥♥♥and fingering your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, pre-pubescent degenerates.
OkGG	Not Recommended	392.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OkGG/	I have a lot of hours in H1Z1 and I really enjoyed it, however with the ever growing battle royale genre, H1Z1 is now lacking depth. With this being said, PUBG seems to be headed in the right direction but ultimetaly it is all personal opinion.Do you prefer fast paced, an arcade style, and goofy mechanics? - Then play H1Z1If you prefer more tactical, realistic graphics, weapons, cars, and overall mechanics. - Play PUBG

zz	Not Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/qvghost/	Okay so let me just start off by saying just don't buy this game. Biggest waste of 20 bucks there is. Bought this game a long time ago before the two h1z1's separated and you know I played from time to time. And so the separation came and I forgot my password like some of us do as well right? Yeah so I feel like playing this game for the first time in a month but I'm locked out of my account. All cool I try to reset my password but in order to do this I need to provide a secret question that I CANT RECALL MAKING. So I decided to write to the support of H1Z1 in order to get my account back and so I see some pages that they have on getting your account back and stuff and I see :Real name:Daybreak Username:Name on Credit Card:The last 4 digits of the Credit Card used on the account:Current answer to your Security Question:And thats the information I cant provide since I don't know the answer to my secret question but Hey theres another option -If you do not have all of the above information, please prepare as much of the following information as you can:The full billing address:E-mail address: And I'm like alright let me do that then and so I do then I wait 2 days for a response which is pretty ridicolous. Okay all good they reply but their response is that I need to provide the answer to my security question before we keep going with the recovery of the account which as I already said I didn't make therefore I don't know the answer to. And I say so in the reply but they keep on insisting on the security question which I don't know and the guy said that if I don't answer he will close the support ticket and so he did. Overall decent game, terrible fu*king support not worth it once you lose your account it's gone cause the people that are suppoused to help don't do anything to help :)

Hinoceros	Recommended	330.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hinoceros/	THIS IS MY OPINION. SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE.ALSO PUBG HAS FIXED ALOT OF THINGS I'VE STATED. REVIEW WAS POSTED JUNE 21st.If you're stuck between PUBG and KOTK let me just break it down for you. KOTK PROS -•Fast paced •Better audio all the way around (in my case at least)•Will run much better on most low end computers, don’t try to buy PUBG if you don’t have at least a decent computer•Nice art style•Consistent updates•Simple•Very entertaining with friends•Spawns are completely random•Good time-to-kill ratio with headshots (as in feels correct when shooting, I feel like I'm doing damage)•Car mechanics work fluidly in this game•Great skins•Ranking system is greatKOTK CONS –•Hit or miss when it comes to hit registering (better hope you’re lucky)•Shotgun is kind of broken and in an awkward slightly OP stage•A few very minor bugs•A 1 in every 500 chance you run into a hacker of some sorts, most are killable but some are top notch•Game ends in a few set areas so it gets old after a while but a new update will fix that•Not many different variants of guns (new one coming soon)Overall I love KOTK and I personally prefer it, but I’ll still put it to you straight on PUBG.PUBG PROS - VERY CONSISTENT UPDATES•Very realistic looking graphics and weapons•Weapons can have attachments•Huge map•Hiding is pretty good (especially in wheat fields) which may be a con for you•Map helps you find your way easily (very noob friendly)•Ability to choose where you land to a degree•Many different map settings•Weather occurs•Character movement is absolutely dope in my opinion•There’s boats•More weaponsPUBG CONS – •Misleading weapon mechanics and time to kill •Cars are clunky and all around just do not work well•The ability to choose spawns makes players spawn in a very linear line which isn’t my favorite honestly (and no you cant reach almost any point when you drop out, you can go pretty far though)•       100 (from what I've had in games at least) people spawn compared to 174 in H1Z1 which just makes H1Z1 more actioned packed•Sounds are terrible, and I mean terrible, if you’re like me and rely on sound a lot in games this game will upset you highly as in you can't normally tell where shots are coming from if you hear them (I have Razer Kracken Chroma's 7.1 in perfect working order and audio settings are perfect, that being said gunshots and things of that nature are very hard to pinpoint which i don't like)•Kick and bullet drop on weapons seems to be not as polished in my opinion then KOTK•You have nothing to really play for, there are ranks (stats wise) but H1Z1 has a way of making you feel more rewarded with placements (yes you get points at a end of a game in PUBG so you can get your 6 cent skin)On the bright side of things, I do believe PUBG has a way higher ceiling then KOTK so it could easily prove me wrong.So there you have it. I was trying my best to not be biased but overall KOTK is my game. Don’t get me wrong, they are both good games and have their own futures. Should be great to watch them grow. Hope this helped. Later.
Vengeful	Not Recommended	395.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082144370/	This game is in alpha mode for like an year now...they split the game to make more money, and still, same bugs, same gigantic queues on battle royale.Its just disrespectful. Dont believe the " early access"tag. Devs dont care about the game. They spent 3 months developing an "hospital" a building inside game, but havent take a single day to work on the ridiculous queues in battle royales. Me and 2 friends bought the game, and once we die, we have to wait 15 minutes to join a new Br.  Imagine playing like that. If this was a temporary thing i wouldnt complain, but this exists every since day 1 of h1z1.0/10
Balthamous	Recommended	58.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Balthamous/	I will preface this review by saying that I actually highly anticipated this game prior to it's release as it was initially promised to be F2P, I held back from buying it throughout "early access" so this may influence my view of it.To start will the positive elements: the map design is actually quite decent, no part of the map feels too populated not does it feel overly empty. Building design perhaps is a bit linear but the overall layout of everything makes it enjoyable to play.The general BR/Hunger games style battle concept is one that I think a large portion of people will enjoy and at times I do enjoy it.Visually the apocalyptic setting fits well with overall feel of the game, despite it having somewhat poor visual fidelity in comparison with other games in it's genre for example Fortnite, PUBG, but it is to be noted this was initially released around 2015 from what I recall.Optimization has also apparently been greatly improved from what I have been told as well in the last few months, but I cannot personally attest to this.Now for the less positive elements: The fact this game was released when it was does not excuse the number of visual glitches and bugs that plague the game for there are many, and it defiantly does look like a F2P title (although this does mean it is playable on far older rigs). It is to be noted that there a number of locations on the map you can glitch inside of buildings you should not be able to enter. For evidence of that you can check my H1z1 screenshots.There is also a somewhat strange issue with mouse sensitivity, this game has no option for raw sensitivity that you can enable in it's menu and has a curious sense of mouse acceleration even when there is none.You must physically enter the user options in the game files to enable raw mouse input, this is notably annoying.The shotgun also rules the roost in terms of weapons and this game does favor a more jump filled run and gun style, which can be a positive or a negative depending on the player.I would suggest if you are thinking about trying the game, you might as well seeing as it is free, but I do have to mention some other issues. I am highly disappointed the original reason for my desiring this game, the survival/zombie element was made into a separate and less developed game.Splitting the game in two to me was not a good idea as it greatly limits the amount of content in it.I also see a great deal of ethical issues with the lack of the publicity on this game going free to play. After it's devs it was to be F2P they backed off on the idea and stated that it was no longer. This was some time ago but they defiantly did not publicize the games F2P release heavily until after a week or so of exiting early access, during this time it was for sale at 20$ in Canada and I know of a number of people who brought it not aware that it was going F2P.That is a seriously shady thing to do imo.

Levi the Terrible	Not Recommended	631.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/levitheterrible/	So anyone in the dark, this used to be a game mode in H1Z1 and is now it's own stand alone game. The split was unnecessary and it reflects a poor quick cash grab on Daybreak's part. Even within their devblog updates, they fail to give any legitimate reason why they should sell 2 products for double the price and change nothing (aside from taking away Green Dawn). There are similar Battle Royale style games that are sold with plenty of other Survival games that are just as comparable, and don't encompass an entirety of a $20 purchase, but are instead an added feature or game mode, as this used to be. Get Rust or DayZ, which offer this and many other game modes, and what I would consider a more tight experience. As an alpha game, this is just dizzying and not worth the money, and it's not even a complete experience. Having already owned H1Z1, I still play it, and it's an enjoyable game, but it's not worth it, and a company that would try to pull something like this is not worth your cash. Sorry Daybreak; ya goofed!

Raider	Not Recommended	236.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968685272/	This game has potential, it has had potential for the entire 18 months it has been in early access. It's a shame then that the absolute pirates at Daybreak Game Company cannot work through the issues this game has. Updates to the game mechanics and interface have been consistently laced with flaws and are mainly there to placate the player base and allow Daybreak to sell more crates and keys. You would think with over 1 million early access sales and their ever consistent crate updates that Daybreak might be able to employ some competent developers.
Officialkong	Not Recommended	1,530.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/officialkong/	I loved this game. I spent so much to make my self look so good. I put so much time in this game to learn and eventually become royalty. One day I got my first win, a lot more followed after. I became a royalty player hitting 15+ kills a solo game and even more in team games. I use to watch stormen he said you need to practice the muscle memory for two taps. I finally managed to keep pulling two taps. But within September the game I loved so much changed to compete with PUB. This game was different for the fast pace skill level game. Now I get killed by a un ranked player or even banned for killing 2 players fighting each other because apparently I'm teaming. This game isn't how it use to be.

pyro	Not Recommended	119.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pate300/	I'm writing this review because i was just in a game with a friend, everything froze for me for 8 seconds and when it worked again the car had exploded and killed us both. The game before that we had to start again, because he got kicked, the game before that we got oneshotted by obvious hackers, the game before that 15 people spawned near me and i had a reload bug.I think you get what I mean, the concept is awesome and the late game is thrilling, but the developer decides to push 25 skin crates and twitch events instead of fixing the most broken game I've played for a long time.In a good, skillbased multiplayer game, you control the outcome of a fight and you are to blame for your loss. In h1z1 it's not your fault 75% of times.
Migneth	Not Recommended	772.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Migneth/	Don't buy the game!The devs are absolutely clueless. They let cheaters, teamers, team killers to wreak havoc, but not once they banned innocent players. It could have been their gold mine, but most of their decisions just harmed the game. They are lying daily in reddit, commenting mostly on the positive feedbacks, while the avg. player count drops every day. The gunplay was never too great, but now they just introduced 'bloom' with the combat update, and even with the community outcry they won't touch anything. The skill gap worsens after every patch. They want it to be a competitive, e-sport game, while making the dumbest decisions ever. The game is going downhill and now nothing will stop it.They change the texture every few months, give us a few new POI, so the end games are more likely to be decided by RNG. Optimization worsens by the time, some high end PC has micro stutters, but since it doesn't affect the majority of the playerbase the fix is not a priority for them.In solo, if you kill somebody, they will probably curse you, scream and/or tell your positions to other players in the most squeaky voice even if it doesn't benefit them. The only consistent thing is the new crates every month or two, although you can't sell the items in the steam market. They give too many free stuff out to have a consistent, normal market.The game won't ever leave early access, and we didn't have a normal game season yet. They also just tell you half a day before the preseason ends so sometimes you won't have the chance to reach your goal.It's still basically the only fast paced BR game as it is now, and i still recommend not to buy it. I didn't even have the time and mood to write down everything that is wrong with the game. You can refund it, if you played <2 hours, or try PUBG, if you are into a slower, boring BR. The BR community probably has to wait for an actual good game./The review is not yet complete, but it has my main points/

Guren MK VIII	Not Recommended	407.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057766742/	When I was 18 I was a stereotypical socially awkward nerd. I had really sh i t luck with women and I was afraid of each and every girl I came across. I was a virgin as well. I had only kissed a couple girls, not much other than that to be honest. My best friend, Liam, always got women. He always told me that talking to girls was easy and not scary at all, just don't be a scared little dog and do it. I always wished I had his confidence. I asked for help to get a girlfriend/someone to ♥♥♥♥ so I wouldn't be a virgin finally. He said he'd help me, I was so damn happy and scared at the same time.So one day he decided to take me to a party he was going to. He was content on getting me laid finally. I was nervous asf. I had a few drinks and I saw a girl I thought was a solid 8/10. A little feral though. Liam saw me looking at her and laughed. I asked him what was funny and instead he pushed me into the same girl. I apologised and was freaking out. Liam came over and said "This here is my boy, he acts shy but he's a ♥♥♥♥ing god. Treat him right." and took off elsewhere. The girl giggled and told me her name was Olivia. Even thought my autism kicked in and I was a complete idiot we hit it off. A guy she knew came over and told her to come have a smoke with him. She said yes as he grabbed her hand and started walking off. She asked me if I smoked, I have never but I said yes anyway cause I wasn't letting this dog take her away from me. I inhaled my first cigarette and naturally I had a coughing fit. They laughed but it was all good. 1 year after that party I was dating Olivia. She took my virginity and we hit it off. I started smoking more often because why not, life was good. I loved her more than I will anything. At least it was until Olivia dumped me. Olivia cheated on me with Liam. Multiple times. The love of my life and my best mate.I became immensly depressed and started chain smoking. At least a pack a day. I did this for a solid 7 months. One day I started to feel a pain whenever I took a deep breath. I♥♥♥♥♥♥myself. I went to to doctor's to find out what was happening. I was so damn worried. My doctor said they'd call me with results after a short time.After a week my doctor called me up with some results. I was freaking the ♥♥♥♥ out at this point. He said I was all clear and lucky because my cells defended my body before cancer could take affect. I cried for 3 days out of relief. I beat cancer. Just for H1Z1 to give it back to me.
Saelim	Not Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977700720/	Such a coincidence that the Devs started updating new features after PUBG started gaining Traction. You know... like simple things like spectating teammates after dying? Get PlayerUnknowns Instead, at least they are trying to update their game Same Concept better gun mechanics.*edit*Also, 90% of the haters nice VAC BANS.I was new to Battle Royale and started on h1z1, then Pubg came out. I prefer Pubg. But, when I played I feel that H1Z1 did not have simple features such as specator mode. This game has been in development for how long and didnt have specator? When Pubg was released they started rolling out patches supporting these SIMPLE features. My opinion is that Daybreak did not have any reason to use resources AKA money because they didn't have competition/reason to update the game. Overall, I feel that Pubg is a better game with better gun mechanics and is more refined.

epk0t 乔希	Not Recommended	2,438.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/epk0t/	Pre-Combat Update - 9/10My only main issue pre-combat update were the occasional cheaters on asia pacific, and full spray AR, but both could have been fixed over time in my opinion.Post-Combat Update - 5/10-Full spray AR is now more effective than ever, and is now the main tactic used in the meta, the shotgun was nerfed into the ground and is now barely useable... AK fullspray at medium range is also far too effective. -They know they should have added recoil patterns to the guns similar to CSGO, but instead they added "bloom" similar to what destiny and other games did, this straight up ruined skilled gunplay as now shots are no longer predictable under recoil, as they randomly spread in a circle instead of an understandable pattern that may take skill to compensate for.-Cheaters are now more common than ever, and these are not the kind wether or not it is a question that they are cheating, more like they are straight advertising cheats for sale in their name such as "FuZhuQQxxxxxxxxxx" (FuZhuQun means auxiliary groups, which means cheating groups, and obvioulsy replace the X's with numbers) and for those who dont understand, QQ and YY are chinese social networks and instant messaging softwares, and they have their number in their name so you can contact them to buy their software, this is not speculation on my part, I know this because I have many many chinese friends that I play this game with and I have just asked them about these names etc without implying anything while asking.-Daybreak knows full well about this but they honestly do not care because if they have delayed bans they can make money off of the cheaters buying new accounts periodically.

Hammer12pc	Not Recommended	806.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052328270/	This game is "decent" when it works, but the developers aka Daybreak are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and are inept at patching a game, it's pathetic. Shotgun damage seems more RNG than anything, but "supposedly" it works beatifully when connected by LAN.... yea great, let's all ♥♥♥♥ing have a LAN party like it's the year 2000. "Spectate Mode" was supposed to be release w/ Z2(new map and UI), but after multiple patches and supposed "fixes" it still doesn't work. Not to even mention the ♥♥♥♥ing car physics.Let me recommend to you the new and already at the same level if not better in some ways Battle Royale game to play. It is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, currently in Closed Beta testing and guess what.... THEY ALREADY HAVE A WORKING SPECTATE MODE. Oh and when you run people over... THEY ACTUALLY DIE!? I didn't know that was possible to do, I just thought that it was really hard to program in those kinds of physics... well apparently if you work at Daybreak.So to reiterate, KotK is made by high-school graduates who are just chasing after money and invest more into advertising than into development, while PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds..... is in Closed Beta for <1 year and already at the same level as KotK. Oh right I should also mention that KotK is still in Pre-Relase/ Alpha for how many years???? If anyone from Daybreak reads this and has anything.... anything to dispute about this, go ahead and try. As you can see from my hours I have plenty of experience in KotK, was Royalty II top 200 players in Pre-season 1, and after that??? When I saw the direction this game was taking and how useless your patches were and how Daybreak was allocating their resources?? Yeah go ♥♥♥♥ yourselves, money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥s.
ZlosiDeR	Not Recommended	44.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zlosider/	I dont usualy write negative reviews, but this game and it's technical page (if that's the right expression) is absolutely garbage.Don't get me wrong the gameplay and mechanism is all really decent. Its fun to play with friends, even solo. But when it comes to technical things I'm about to lose control and hit something.Talking about optimization in this game is probably main stream and I don't fully mind having 45-60 fps. but when I can't even alt+tab. Not even accidentally because then it ♥♥♥♥s up so hard that I have to force the shut down of the PC then is something wrong. And it's not even alt+tab, I can't even exit the game the way it's supposed to be exited. Cuz of black screen again and yea next shut down approaching. have to exit the game through task manager, and its like 75% change. On 25%  it won't let me so, forced shut down or try to sleep my PC which is like 50% chance aswell.Actually I could talk♥♥♥♥♥♥about this game all day long, but I feel like there is no purpose, people won't even read this or just leave negative thumb because they are the ones that like the game and they don't want to see negative reviews. So I'll end it here with words. That the gameplay is kinda good, if u have really good PC u probably can maxed out the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of it and have good fps and probably u won't experience things I do.  But I hope it gets better for people with normal PC's.Didn't want to write this but after last playing I just had to. it was too much for me.Sorry for my englando and have a nice day lads, you will do better if you buy other games.

The issue is when you want to play with your friends and enjoy the teamwork aspect of the game there is no incentive for performance.

AKHiro	Not Recommended	141.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070912238/	I remember playing this game back in the summer of 2017 and It was a really fun game. This game had a lot of potential and espically since they had some great updates that give players better experience in the game. I especially like the logic of getting out of the car and you were able to gang up on someone without taking any damage because the game didn't use real physics. It was a blast to play with friends because it was fast pace cause everyone dropped from the same area and had to travel outwards from there. It forced people who wanted to get down quick to be prepare to fight. This game was fun and interesting at the time and I believe it's the first battle royal series. This game has a speical place in my heart and I had great memory with it. Now this game turn to the worse, the developers haven't fix some of the bugs and glitches that has been with the game for months and this new update with the weapons makes it digusting to shoot. In most fps game the character is the one shaking from the recoil which is fine because it makes it look realistic but what H1Z1 did was made your whole screen shake and it makes me feel sick and nauseous to shoot. The game still feels blocky and tacky when I move around and try grabbing loot. This game just feels worse to play and even when this game became free to play the queue is honestly dead. I played a match with only 13 people in solo and that was just sad to see. The developers did not take the right approach with this game and this will become their downside. I hope in the future this game will get some better updates and grow a new community as it can still be a fun battle royal but the developers need to take a different step for their game to make it unique and different compare to the other battle royal games like Fortnite and Pubg.

scarpdoo22	Not Recommended	64.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zablash/	This game is a disgrace to the PC community. We are now paying double for a PRE-ALPHA version of a game mode that was already included in the main game: H1Z1. This is very clearly a cash grab. When you start developing a game, you don't decide to split it up and double up costs due to your company's own lack and misuse of budget. You are punishing the players and the community for a mistake in your own development. When you create a game and promise to keep it fresh and updated at least until release you keep the game running and keep the features coming. Both of which are not happening in this case due to a shady / money hungry development team. If you promise F2P in the future for your buggy PRE-ALPHA game and decide to go back on that promise PLUS go one further and make your incoming player base pay double for the same game we had prior to this split, you don't deserve the playerbase. For all players, new and old, we now have to buy skins for both "games" which are basically the same game and inventory format. Comparing this to CSGO, it is like having to buy skins for each game mode they offer, Casual/Deathmatch/Competitive etc. It is honestly ridiculous. Daybreak and everyone involved with developing / publishing this game, Get your heads out of your own asses.

I will leave this review public as an archive of what my thoughts were when the game was not free.----------------------------------------*THIS IS THE SAME REVIEW I PUT ON H1Z1: JUST SURVIVE.*H1Z1 just split into two games. Yep that's right. And not only two games, two $20.00 games. That's basically why it's not recommended.H1Z1 is a very fun survival game, my favorite being the Battle Royale gamemode, now known as "King of the Kill". The games have not changed one bit, still very fun, but for new players, this could be heartbreaking. A previously single $20.00 game is now split up into two games that you have to basically choose which one you want to buy/play instead of just choosing the gamemode. I think this idea of splitting the game was just a way of getting more money and basically scamming new players into buying two games for what once was a single game. Other than that, I recommend this game 100%. For now, i'll say Not Recommended.

You can get glitched in doors and objects extremely easily still. Spawns are absolute garbage more than half the time. All the weaponry is centered in towns and is way too abundant. Queue times are garbage as well. For being out in 'alpha' for as long as it has, their first priority was micro transactions, not actually fixing the game itself.

Easelm	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/easelm/	Note: I bought H1Z1 in Dec. 2015 and enjoyed it for 40+ hours. After the split, my hours were moved to H1Z1: Just Survive, hence why I have 49 minutes played in H1Z1: Kotk. Though, I play H1Z1 on my second account.TL;DR Go buy PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS. It's 200% better than H1Z1 and it has what H1Z1 will probably never have; Great development team, weapon attachments, winner/loser rewards, better gunplay & combat and much more...ReviewH1Z1: King of the Kill is an okayish first person/third person shooter. Before, it was called Battle Royale (sorta still is), over a hundred people participating in a huge death match. It will make you paranoid and you have to really loot fast, listen, shoot, kill and look all around you to survive. You can select Solo, Duo and Fives. Playing H1Z1: King of the Kill is decent with friends and sometimes even solo play. They also have a "Pre Season" leaderboard where you can track your solo progress (kills, score, etc).H1Z1: Kotk has around 25k+ players at minimum playing almost constantly. I've seen as high as a 73k+ player base at times. There's no shortage of people or queue times (they recently fixed queue times which made it pretty much instant to get into a game). Starting out, you'll wait in a lobby until the timer runs out for the game to start. Once the game has started you'll begin to parachute down to a huge map from a decent height to choose a spot that might have good loot or you can hover in the air, look where everybody else is going so you can avoid them as you parachute down. Most of the time it's about getting to the ground as fast as possible to gather loot or even a vehicle to have a better start for yourself.Yes, loot and vehicles. There's only 4 vehicles: Truck, Jeep, Police Car and ATV. Truck is the slowest of them all, but it's better than nothing. Jeep is the second fastest whilst police car and ATV will go faster than the rest. However, ATV can only hold 2 players, whilst the other vehicles hold 5 players. Vehicles allow you to move around the map faster, but they do have fuel and health.Loot, ahh yes. There's a lot of loot. RNG depicts where loot goes. Pistols, assault rifles, grenades, molotovs, helmets, armor (makeshift/lammy) and more! Loot is always something to make everyone fight over and I've had my fair share of experience with that. You can choose to go all out and loot everything you see or gather a certain amount of items and kill other people for their items instead. Try not to loot everything you see - There's bag space. You can have an ordinary backpack that holds 1200~ weight or a military backpack that holds 2200~. Each item you loot will take up bag space. Becareful looting though, players can easily pick you off while you're looting. I've had bad experiences with that too.I think the most lethal to you besides those pesky serial killers we call players is the toxic gas. The gas is released after the safe zone is revealed and the 5 minute timer is up. Before that you'll need to be near that safe zone circle or you're toast. The gas will get powerful as the game progresses so you'll always need to be a step ahead of it. I've even used the gas to my advantage. Know where the gas is going to spread to and if you're in the safe zone & the enemy isn't you can fire at them, drop their health and the gas will do the rest (given they are still in it). It's amusing when that happens. Although, I've had my fair share of gas deaths.I can't really say much about their graphics in the game other than they aren't that great at max settings. My settings are on low so I can see other players better (mainly just lighting off, shadows low, other is medium to high). It's best if you tinker with your settings to find it easier to see items and players much better without much darkness.H1Z1: King of the Kill has a crate system. The game isn't P2W, it's just cosmetics. They even have a "scrap" system where you can scrap items for the scrap currency and turn scrap in for more items. Their skull system allows you to back yourself in solo play. If you do well in solo play you'll earn skulls once bet. After leveling every 5 levels you'll also receive free unlocked crates to open; otherwise, playing the game will earn you locked crates you can sell on the steam community market.The feeling you feel when winning a game is pretty intense at times, until you realize there's no rewards for winning.Bugs, Early Access & FrustrationsLet's not forget H1Z1: King of the Kill is still in early access and it does have a lot of issues. This is what makes me mainly dislike this game. They do release updates every month or so, but I feel like there's not enough hotfixes to fix common bugs or updates to the game to bring in different, items, features, etc. H1Z1: Kotk has been in development for several years++ and no major improvements. It's pretty upsetting.The most common bug I run into is stuck parachuting. You're hovering above the ground whilst the parachute is still intact and will force you to exit the match, but normally it ends up crashing your client instead. Second common bug is parachuting under the world, forcing you to logout and again it'll crash the client instead. Not to mention the glorious amount of loot bugs where some loot has sunk into the ground, object its on, etc. It'll even cause the ammo to do the same depending if any objects are near, the ammo will go inside of that object and you won't be able to loot them. Let's also not forget a large amount of objects floating in midair.Collision is another thing. It might as well not exist, especially with vehicles. Trying to run over someone with a vehicle at full speed will not always kill players.Gunplay is terrible. You can jump around like the ground is hot lava to avoid being shot or have an enemy do the same. They need to limit jumping.I think the most frustrating part of H1Z1: King of the Kill is how static the map is and the places you never parachute down to anymore. It would make gameplay experience better if their map or map objects in general was procedurally generated. Of course loot is based on RNG, but I feel like the map should have a significant difference almost every playthrough.I ask myself every time I play H1Z1 Kotk, "How come we never spawn at the Dam anymore?". In the old map it was fun parachuting down to the dam, gathering loot and killing people since the place is FULL of loot. Nowadays to even loot the dam you need to be lucky enough to spawn close by, get a vehicle and drive 3 minutes to arrive there. You'll have roughly 4 minutes to loot the richness of the Dam, but it's worth it since nobody goes there anymore.I feel like the utilization of the map edges A-J 1-10 is horribly lacking. They only have it where people are spawned more inside of the map than on the sides.The second most frustrating thing is, they removed the rewards for winning or losing. Back in 2015 you used to receive a loot bag that you can open. Depending on how well your position was in a game you'll get a better loot bag. But, when I came back to H1Z1 early 2016 that was removed. Winning or dying at a certain number is no longer rewarding. The only thing you have is bragging rights and that's not really incenitive to keep playing besides the Solo Season, which is 1% better than being rewarded with item(s).There's more issues to this game that I feel could be resolved. I think there's more things Daybreak can do to H1Z1: Kotk since it does have potential. Would be nice if they introduced new weapons or new items in general, game modes, etc - That's the potential this game has, but development is too slow and hotfixes are almost always non-existent.OverallH1Z1: King of the Kill as I wrote has potential, but it's on a bad development path with redundant decision making and development team.Rating: 5/10

Twitch.tv/RecKaCyde	Not Recommended	108.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Reckacyde/	The developer has a long history of releasing buggy, unoptimized, and overall terrible games ripe with microtransactions, and this one is no different. They LIED about it going free to play, and then split their game in half, doubling the total price before it's even out of Alpha. This is not okay! This change is nothing but a dirty cash grab. Daybreak as a company has a track record of failure and will do anything to try to get out of the red, and this is a prime example.They haven't released a quality game in over 15 years. With all due respect to their employees and their livelihoods, this company should have been abolished years ago. It has been driven into the ground repeatedly by poor management, and compounded by lousy investments from both Sony and Columbus Nova. No one talks about it, but there is no guarantee this game will even be available to play in months, let alone years. In 2014 Daybreak (then SOE) reportedly lost Sony $60 million, and now just one year after being sold off, this is the kind of gouging they're trying to pull on customers. Not enough red flags for you? They've had multiple huge layoffs over the years, at times completely devestating their customer support and quality assurance teams.
ShiftyTheMLGPro	Not Recommended	33.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtAKAShifty/	DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME!The cash grabbers dared to split up a game into two. They charge you 20 bucks for this piece of work, average waiting time on servers to play on is 5+ minutes. The game has been out for over a year now. What have they produced? Less than even the DayZ SA devs in that same amount of time, which is rather sad considering they have to compensate for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ engine. A couple of pistols and a few rifles? 3 whole cars to choose from? Great. If you're asking yourself why I have this, I bought the game on release last year, thinking it might be worthwile. To be honest, there hasn't been a zombie survival game actually worth playing the last couple of years.If you want to play BR, go play it on ArmA 3, where it's supposed to be played. Hell, even CS:GO's Hunger Games are more fun than this monstrosity.Cheers

Its fun exept having a stupid spawn system, weird physics, many bugs which is pretty normal for such a new game in alpha so not really a big problem for now.But there are many simple and small bugs that would be really easy to fix them for Developers - Creators of the game like the Steering wheels of vehicles not steering, door-jump bug, and many small things that i cant remember atm. A big part of this game is skins, almost everybody like them and have different nice skins, but we all  have to wear our skins every single time on waiting lobby before match, I think it would be really easy for Daybreak squad to make an option to Set skins as custom outfit on main menu or something like that so we wouldn't lose time on every begginning of a match. But the biggest reason of the game making me cancer is the developers of the game that they dont care about players, There are thousands of players who has the  ''Overlay not displaying with shift+TAB'' issue but %90 of them can't solve it properly and creators of game never publish an official solution or a patch to fix it. The thing that I cant understand its we all know such a greedy - stingy company is DayBreak, But many people can't buy keys-cases because of the shift+TAB problem, But they are insisting to not solve this damn issue and let people have fun. Its annoying A.F. When people text me from steam, I cant answer without pressing ALT+TAB, I cant buy keys-cases in no way, when my friends invite me to lobby i need to ALT+TAB again. I bought this game approximetly 1 year ago, trying to fix it since last summer, spent around 6-7 hours to fix and haven't done a progress at all.

Once daybreak took over, you saw the shift from a company trying to create a quality product with great graphics to a company that only cares about the money its getting out and literally cares nothing about the game itself... there is yet to be a single patch to this game that been game changing since daybreak took over...Lets talk about the split.With the split of the games, the reasoning behind it as Daybreak put, "So we could have different teams working on the different games with different agendas...."SO FAR EVERY UPDATE AND CRATE RELEASED HAS BEEN FOR BOTH GAMES, WITHOUT ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL FOR EACH GAME....Dont waste money on this game,  I don't recomment it to anyone.

They made the game worse. As of 2/19/2016 dont get this game. Very dumb. They should make more servers so you can get in faster. Garbage developers.

Saint Aaron	Not Recommended	28.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011965365/	I cant really tell you what the big hype for this game is. I think the big thing that gets me is the constant bugs. Bugs from getting stuck on the ground when landing, going underneath the map, getting stuck in the cars, and fences.The game is great if you take away from the bugs but it does need a lot of work.The biggiest problem i have is a2 shotgun rounds point blank in the head doesnt kill someone with no helmet, but an ar15 going after someone with a helmet can kill me with 4shots with full health. The game logic doesnt add up and from playing this game last year to now, this was still a major problem they had. After a year of this being a standalone, i really cant see the big issues being fixed. But besides the bugs the combat is really fun when the bugs arnt happeming. You will always be surrounded by people keeping your guard up most of the time.ProsDriver carsLots of ppl to fight offGotta lead your shotsPlenty of gunsrandom bombs will drop on youLots of buildings to enterConsThe gas moves to slow needs to be sped upBugs ruin the gamecouple of cheaters (every online game has em)Shotguns dont work most of the time

Tazz	Not Recommended	4.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lord1027/	I'm going to say "Meh". Why the bad review?Well, I'm not going to write the full story, I'll try to keep it short.My first day of H1Z1: King of the Kill, my third match. We play in a team of 3, I'm just getting to learn the basics.One of my teammates dies soon after we landed, the other one gets shot few minutes later when we were looting. I manage to kill the attacker and now I'm alone with more than 100 other players alive.So I just hide inside a trailer and wait... and wait, lucky for me I am in a pretty good spot (G 6), gas wasn't coming in my area. At some point, when there were around 30 people left alive, I decide to leave my spot as gas was coming my way. I manage to kill 2 guys driving a car and follow my way up the hill.Fast forward, there's 7 of us alive, I'm really excited to have gotten this far. I was on TeamSpeak with my teammates describing what's happening and asking for advice. The area without gas is becoming a tiny dot and forcing us to meet... Considering this was a match of up to 5 players teams, I decide to hide after some trees and wait for one of the (at least) 2 remaining teams to kill the other one so I could actually stand a chance.And then it happens... game closes, no error, no message, no nothing. And now I'm writing this review...

BOT Matt	Recommended	456.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/all_hail_fish/	THIS IS MY OPINION. SORRY IF YOU DON'T AGREE.ALSO PUBG HAS FIXED ALOT OF THINGS I'VE STATED. If you're stuck between PUBG and KOTK let me just break it down for you. KOTK PROS -•Fast paced •Will run much better on most low end computers, don’t try to buy PUBG if you don’t have at least a decent computer•Nice art style•Consistent updates•Simple•Very entertaining with friends•Spawns are completely random•Good time-to-kill ratio with headshots (as in feels correct when shooting, I feel like I'm doing damage)•Car mechanics work fluidly in this game•Great skins•Ranking system is greatKOTK CONS –•Hit or miss when it comes to hit registering (better hope you’re lucky)•A few very minor bugs•A 1 in every 500 chance you run into a hacker of some sorts•Game ends in a few set areas so it gets old after a while but a new update will fix that•Not many different variants of guns (new one coming soon)*out now the HellfireOverall I love KOTK and I personally prefer it, but I’ll still put it to you straight on PUBG.PUBG PROS - VERY CONSISTENT UPDATES•Very realistic looking graphics and weapons•Weapons can have attachments•Huge map•Hiding is pretty good (especially in wheat fields) which may be a con for you•Map helps you find your way easily (very noob friendly)•Ability to choose where you land to a degree•Many different map settings•Weather occurs•Character movement is absolutely dope in my opinion•There’s boats•More weaponsPUBG CONS – •Misleading weapon mechanics and time to kill •Cars are clunky and all around just do not work well•The ability to choose spawns makes players spawn in a very linear line which isn’t my favorite honestly (and no you cant reach almost any point when you drop out, you can go pretty far though)• 100 (from what I've had in games at least) people spawn compared to 174 in H1Z1 which just makes H1Z1 more actioned packed•Kick and bullet drop on weapons seems to be not as polished in my opinion then KOTK•You have nothing to really play for, there are ranks (stats wise) but H1Z1 has a way of making you feel more rewarded with placements (yes you get points at a end of a game in PUBG so you can get your 6 cent skin)On the bright side of things, I do believe PUBG has a way higher ceiling then KOTK so it could easily prove me wrong.So there you have it. I was trying my best to not be biased but overall KOTK is my game. Don’t get me wrong, they are both good games and have their own futures. Should be great to watch them grow. Hope this helped. Later.

Smale ~ ♥	Not Recommended	265.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004112215/	Steaming pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥made by the most incompetent developer team in the world. They legitimately can´t fix ANYTHING in this game without causing something else to break. You wait a month, two for the next patch just to find out that the majority of the issues aren´t addressed, some bugs are months and months and months old. Servers are some of the worst in the industry, de-sync is at least a full second in this game and after most of your deaths you'll be left with legit question marks above your head on how did you just die?!?! Skill gap in this game is very little because of how random it is and inconsistent. You can Two tap one guy and then a minute later witness majority of your bullets do nothing to the next guy and end up dead, get a frame skip where your game legit freezes for a split second or get crazy lag/de-sync where you peak back behind the corner but the guy still gets a shot or two or ♥♥♥♥ing two taps your♥♥♥♥♥even though you got behind cover. Hit registration is just awful and the guns in general are inconsistant, especially shot gun. Sometimes you one shot kill someone full health 10 feet away and the next time you stick your shotgun into the guys mouth, deepthroating him to no effect, not even a gag. Basically, you're rolling a dice in every gun fight. TL:DR. This game is garbage and i hope DayBreak sells it to some big time Publisher that will pass it to a competent dev team to piece it together. Then i hope that the whole staff of DayBreak studios buys themselves tickets to a cruise and hits an iceberg, causing the ship to sink.

SeroPanda	Recommended	185.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/krikiko/	This game is really good, maybe PUBG is better in some expects, but take a look at the price. You should buy H1Z1 instead of PUBG if you don`t have much money you can spent on games.

Eddisdead	Not Recommended	460.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/eddisdead94/	I got to top 8 today and I was pretty confident about winning the whole match.

I'd never recommend anyone a game that has as many bugs as this one even if it had potential, or even if I still play it almost daily. I'm going to update my review if they ever decide to fix the game, and I think it's pretty ridiculous that it's still so buggy even after all the time Daybreak's had to develop the game.

Just to pick up a gun on the ground it can take 5 seconds being a sitting duck.Edit: and very-very often commands like the use of medkit are not taken into account which means death if you don't double check if the healing icon appear on the lower right of the screen.I could also talk of the game physics that are so crap that they're hillarous.Also the recoil of the guns is not like in any clever game, here recoil never resets so it means that you have to constantly reaim for all bullets fired and for people with a standard monitor it is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥because of remanency.Those crap dev could try to play Half-Life 1 which is 20 years old and done it correcly on release.Edit : last game i got killed by an obvious cheater, so there is decomplexed cheating.Finally this game is just promises that might never be delivered.

This game actually isn't all that bad. It takes some skill, so don't expect to be good within 10-20 hours of playing, unless you have prior experience playing a BR. The devs are trying their best now to listen to the community and provide updates and content we all want. So, if you try this game and have a bad experience, I ask you to not give up, rather than to try again. This game is actually fun and deserves a second chance.

zachhockey2	Not Recommended	297.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zachhockey2/	This game is very fun when it's fun (20% of the time?)... However, the other 80% of the time, you'll want to rip your hair out, break your peripherals, and curse the developers. Vast majority of deaths are inexplicable -- for instance, you may shoot someone point blank with a shotgun only for that person to do the same to you and you are the only to die. When the death screen comes up, that person still has 70+ hp often regardless of whether or not they had armour. I could go on and on. Development is a disgrace. This game is a minimum of two years out from being a releasable game because the developers rarely update the game. When they do, they often improve one thing but degrade or break one or two other aspects. Is it worth 20 dollars? Yeah. Will you hate yourself for playing? Definitely. Note to new gamers: this game is not friendly to beginners. At all. Isn't even friendly to veterans like myself with 15+ wins.

steez nuts	Not Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/franzj/	I love this game. It's really fun and an amazing experience to play with friends. However, there are two things are that holding this game back. The streamers and the developers. Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers. "There are two rules for success... Number one, never reveal everything you know."The Streamer. These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping. I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys...  If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out. The laziness and the "♥♥♥♥ YOU, GIVE ME MONEY!" attitude from the streamers disgust me the most. They could easily put up a delay, blur out information, and block out the map... BUT, they choose not to. Instead, this is where the devs come into play..."Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."The Devs. With very little to no proof at all, they will ban you outright because a streamer cried stream sniper. In fact, the devs don't even need proof, the streamers' tears and butthurt emotions show all the proof that he's a salty loser. You guys need to listen to the real community, the Steam reviews, the people on Reddit. Not to the dumbasses who stream and cry "STREAM SNIPER, BAN HIM!" whenever they get salty about being killed. At this point, there are possibly more innocent people banned than actual stream snipers. Go for the real problems, the hackers, the exploiters, and OPTIMIZATION. This is completely unacceptable and you guys are sucking the streamer's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ TL;DRDEVS, you guys need to man up and tell these guys to ♥♥♥♥ off. STREAMERS, if you got killed because you couldn't bother to hide important information, you're an idiot and you have no right to complain.

a flying willy	Recommended	5.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PSYCHEDELIC_CHEESECAKE_WAFFLES/	NOTE TO READERS:I appologize as I didn't realize that steam had a cap on review character limits, so I will link my blog here:https://plus.google.com/u/0/collection/YOUdYEand any further updates that I have will be available on this blog.BACKSTORY:ha, I have no standards. I’m always willing to try a game if it goes free to play, and I haven't really tried any battle royal games yet because I usually stand outside the hype and wait to see how the game pans out.in this case, Fortnite looked interesting, but I never really wanted to play it for some odd reason. PUBG looked cool at first, but with the game looking like a big glitchy mess, and the devs not really knowing wtf they're doing at the moment, I chose to hold my 30 dollars and wait for something else.I got the notification today that h1z1 went free-to-play and I figured I’d give it a shot. I’m always cautious about games going free due to some really shady practices. (learned this the hard way with payday 2) so, how were my first impressions with h1z1?FIRST IMPRESSIONS:So, from the get go I enter the game and go into a solo match. my first session was very weird as I was getting to know the game and still figuring out how things work. I got lots of items and weapons, but soon realized that I spawned myself across the map and not it the safe zone. I took this as a freak-out moment and I started running for the safe zone. safe to say, I died from gas, and I was decently high up as well, finishing the match at number 13th. I then quit out of the match and chose to navigate the game.exploring the menu I found it kind of a bummer that almost every kind of crate can only be unlocked with crowns (paid currency), I do understand this as the game is free and most of the crates strictly have cosmetics, but it would be nice to have an option to get them with at least a few thousand or so skulls (in-game currency). I found that there's lots of nice options for getting your own customizations on clothing, weapons, and vehicle skins. I chose to exit and go back into solo matches.this is a personal gripe, but I wish the game defaults to a higher sensitivity, yes you can change this, but I had a bit of a difficult time navigating menus mid-match to find and adjust these, because they were all so low. however, the game does have lots of options for key-binding.my next few matches usually followed the same pattern of either dying almost as soon as landing, or hiding most of the match and dying later on. until one of my later matches I hadn't actually gotten a kill, literally in my 1.9 hours played I only got one kill. talk about needing to git gud. however, after this I started doing some experimenting with the later matches and started giving myself lots of different spawning positions, this mostly had me launch myself straight into the densest areas to test my skills under pressure, spoiler alert: I’m not very good yet. but, for what it's worth, getting killed under pressure, or later in the game after camping was quite fun and tense.as for my stopping point, I’m currently a level 6, with a placement of 143 on silver level 3.GRIPES:no game is prefect, and this one definitely isn't immune. first off, who the f**k came up with the pricing on the bronze, silver, and gold dlc packs for this game? I know that it's all cosmetics, but seriously whoever made a few skins worth 100 dollars needs to go back to payday 2 and keep it there.secondly, I understand that the sponsored loot packs in the game can only be bought with crowns, but why are the crates that you unlock in-game opened with crowns as well? seriously, this kind of sucks that something I unlock is still kept behind a paid wall unless I manage to finish high enough on the leaderboards by the end of the season. please change this to at least unlocking them with skulls so us free players can still enjoy some (most likely) uncommon loot. we don't all have another 5 dollars to throw at a game for pixels.within the graphics optimizations, if you try to set the game to anything over 110 percent detail, the game lags out like crazy. I know it's not my laptop as well (Acer Predator 17 with NVidia 1080) seeing as how I can run more demanding games that this with ease. note: you don't need this to be at ultra-settings to have fun, but it still sucks to see some poor optimization here.POSITIVES:this game is quite fun, even on solo (seeing as how that's the only part I’ve tried so far). now, I may have a slight bias due to the fact that I haven’t tried other battle royale game, but I still enjoyed this. it's quite challenging, and the game gives a nice payoff for overcoming some tense situations, and leveling up. I think this is nice, and I will devote more time in the future towards this game.mind you, I didn't play this game when it was paid, so I can't compare it to previous versions until this one gets updated, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.REVIEW SCORING:Fun Factor (solo): quite fun and challengingFun Factor (duo): N/AFun Factor (squad): N/AControls: easy to learn (may want to change sensitivity)Graphics: fairly nice (needs a decent computer to run)Optimization: poorDifficulty: skilled (with a high learning curve)Microtransactions Ethic: poorOVERALL: 7/10 would recommend for an intro into "realistic" battle royale (like PUBG rather than Fortnite), and stay if you can deal with not purchasing many microtransactionsFINAL NOTE:this review will be updated (hopefully) after each of my play sessions. I will be reaching out to some friends to try the other modes after a few more solo matches. I will update on any further things that I notice in game, and on any updates that they add to the game afterwards. I hope to keep doing these until I reach 100 hours in game, and then optional updates after that point. I won't update the score or change to not recommended until I get a lot more playtime in this game, enough to find other things to either praise or gripe about.thank you if you read all of this, and I hope this helped you out. I’m sorry if this was a lot of reading to do. I don't post reviews a lot, so I’m trying to find a start. I will try to refine my reviews as time goes on, and I find better ways of presenting. thank you again and have a great game!
Prog	Not Recommended	76.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154435434/	Before you start saying "It's Early Access bro, 420 blaze it, china #1, SAMMIT" that I know most people that play this game would say... This game is buggy, and it gets worse and worse.  Today I died by a vehicle in 1-man BR while I was parachuting in. I spawned in and fell to my death way up in the sky.  Another time I was standing in a kitchen tearing up clothes to make bandages, and I died.  The kill message said "better luck next time", normally it says who killed you and how much life they had.  I have died 3 out of 5 times due to bugs, and in Just Survive people can glitch invisible.  Now before you say "it's in Alpha", this is where i say, I'm trying to prevent people from wasting their money on an unfinished game.  Wait until it is finished or comes out to beta, in probably 37 years.  There are plenty of other alternative games that are less buggy that you can play for a few years before this one is ready.  Do your research before buying a game!!

/just/	Not Recommended	117.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198161834777/	The game would be far better if the bugs that have existed for months were actually fixed. With every "patch" they release more problems seem to occur as a result. Bump into a rock at idle speed in a vehicle with full health and it blows up, get shot in the chest with armor that doesn't get damaged, ridiculous drop shotting that they will never fix, terrible desyncing issues, jumping through walls on office buildings, roof exploits, hits that don't register. But they add a new reticle which wasn't necessary, change the fire rate of the AK, and a few other things that really didn't matter, very disappointing. It has so much potential to be a great game but the development team seems to have no intention of fixing actual problems with the game.

Kurakeisari	Not Recommended	294.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kurakeisari/	Since the game is officially released, i fix my review. This game is pretty solid contender for trash tier game awards.To know the latest. They officially released this game (Pretty much did nothing but push it out and call it full release) and charged people for the game. Once the hype went down a little, they decided to just push the game out as free to play so those who actually spent money on the game copy got massive slap in the face. Just fyi, the reputation alone on this game means nobody wants to go near it and the popularity often lasts from days to several weeks, after that it's dead game outside prime time.Don't buy this game folks.

Zillank™	Not Recommended	370.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146611140/	First of all if you are reading this in contemplation on weather to get PUBG or H1Z1 then my answer is PUBG if your computer can run it, H1 has fallen so far from what it was and now all i get is , into a game land and die, as there is no skill gap and nothing to accomidate for different players i have to say this game is dying and with PUBG's larger player count the game is just a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥There are / have been no new guns and no physical gun modifications so all you are left with is the bad players and the VERY good players (there is literaly no way to improve) i will be however be coming on and off this game to see changes but over all i would not reccomend as the changes are small and inefective, such as the new shot gun centre pellet, this was supposed to fix the shot gun at close range and make it more reliable but all i get is either 1. kill someone form like 10 metres away 2. get a 10 hp shot and die and 3. get one bombed by cod rushers so my point is the updates do not work and if a player wants to play passive or fire from a far they either have to be a pro at judging distance or skillful enough to get the sniper which is only avadible in air drops which are virtually impossible to get as there is always like 5-10 people getting there at the same time.Finally i would like to see the game develop but the only way i see this working is to have games found based on your ability thus giving the game a skill gap and allowing people to actaully develop as a player, But in conclution dont buy the game if you acspect to be good in the first 100-200 hours it will take around 500 to get to a good standard so ireccomend PUBG (again if your computer can run it) because iplayed for the first time and within my first game iwas able to get a kill and pick up some skill and knowledge about the game, unlike h1z1.

∨∨ᴉ⊣CH HOUS3 S▲SH▲	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Antichristian_Industrialist/	So I learned this game used to have two modes with one involving zombies. The zombies aspect of it was taken out and split  during it's Early Access phase. Instead of being taken out completely, it was made into it's own game called Just Survive to milk supporters for more money. So I plaed this for a little bit with friends and noticed there were a few hackers here and there taking the fun out of the game. What really saddens me is that the developers don't do anything about it or seem so. Save your money and stay away from this game.EDIT:I just learned that this game has been in Early Access for 2 years. Truly pathetic. And with only one map this whole time? Seriously? PUBG came out in Early Access in March of 2017 and officially released in December. Now I gave PUBG a negative review as well but at least it’s a more competent game. And get this, with 2 maps and another one in the works. There may be cheaters in PUGB also but at least the devs of that game are willing to do something about it unlike the H1Z1 devs. Now no matter how many hours you have, you cannot deny this. Even people with far more hours than me on this game agree.

The game still feels Like it's in alpha. This is before considering the problem it had yesterday with server overload which should have been expected but wasnt. My problems so far:Game randomly lags despite having a computer that can run it no problemRandom disconnectionsInconsistant frames Textures not loadingNot being able to leave game normally and having to force close.there's probably more problems but I've just listed the ones on the top of my head.I honestly feel like the game ran better before it became a "full release" or whatever you wanna call this.I hope the devs fix their game.

I'm in the Lodge	Not Recommended	75.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ImintheLodge/	I currently only have 15 hours on this game, and choose to play it casually as a nice change of pace game with friends, so keep this bias in mind as you read:H1Z1: KOTK at its core is a a fun game--randomly parachute into a large area and find weapons, vehicles, and supplies haphazardly scattered throughout the map to survive and combat enemy players/teams. It is a very interesting concept and definitely yields some fun moments as you play the game, especially with friends. As I write I can recall a couple very cool instances, whether it be sprinting to escape the gas as it closes in the safe area, or even using the well employed VOIP to communicate with random people in the community and have some fun. Unfortunately, however, I cannot in all consciousness endorse this game, and definitely urge anyone who reads this to beware buying this.One of its major flaws reside in the game mechanics and its consistency. Any sort of interaction with others players, including gun fights, melee fights, and even riding in vehicles with others, is awful and inconsistent. Hitboxes are horrible; theres definitely a steep learning curve to using guns, and any sort of melee combat is useless. If you so much as come within 3 feet of a wall, you will be prohibited from firing your weapon, which is especially awful in all of the close combat that exists in this game. Opening/closing doors occasionally doesn't register. Besides these coding problems, one of the biggest gameplay issues revolves around the map, which is roughly a huge 64 km^2 area. Utilization of this incredibly huge area is abysmal as safe zones are generally constricted to the same few areas in the south, and its pretty commonplace to spawn (via parachute) alongside multiple other people. This means that unique geographical features (such as the castle in the north) go unappreciated and parachuting in becomes less of a strategy and more of a race with 15 other people to a single vehicle or trailer (and thus results in massive bloodshed 10 seconds into the game in the form of one person beating everyone to an AK and racking in the multi-kills). Daybreak, the map size is awesome, spread everyone out! If I wanted to be real nitpicky I could mention the unrealistic car mechanics or rough character movement (i.e. when jumping/shooting), but at $20 and considering the numerous other issues, these small nuances can be overlooked. Another huge flaw in my opinion is the community. I know it's not fair to judge a game's community based on the actions of the select few, but unfortunately, finding someone yelling profanities over game chat is more consistent than even the game's mechanics. On top of this, there exists widespread cheating in solo (with individuals teaming up in a free for all) and teams (where multiple teams work together). This paired with one of the largest skill gaps on a videogame I have ever played is really frustrating. I really hate complaining about people who practice their hobby and get good at a videogame, but when one guy can 1 v 5 my team, my enjoyment suffers. Daybreak needs to introduce casual/ranked game modes, or employ some sort of ranking system where people with similar skill levels play each other. Finally, the community has communicated (in the form of spending their money) that they value aesthetics (in the form of microtransations) more than core game mechanics. Consider this for a second: a game that is in early access (and has been for almost a year) has made sure to get microtransactions working, but not even the game? I know the culture of videogames has evolved to include microtransactions, but I still believe a videogame company has an obligation to make a game that people paid for work before trying to further charge players and profit. I have unfortunately already voiced my support (by buying this game), but I know many have steered clear simply due to this fact.A final large issue revolves around networking. If you buy this game, prepare for lag. I'm not even just talking about shots not registering (which is actually a huge issue), but full blown desynchronization from the server I have never experienced in any other game before. There are *several* instances where my friends and I have ran into this issue which include: parachuting in but being unable to move or run for the whole match; entering/exiting a vehicle but the game doesn't register, and thus you are stuck in or out on your screen but the opposite on the server; and even randomly dying out of nowhere. Paired with an already large skill gap (yes, I know, mad cuz bad), and a wait period between matches just long enough to be annoying (especially when waiting for your friends to die), and these networking issues become an unacceptable waste of my time.   To conclude, this game has a lot of unrealized promise. Daybreak could work really hard to correct even just a few of the aforementioned things and I'd be willing to change my review to recommend it. Unfortunately, however, this company will never work to improve their game. Why would they? People continue to throw money at the devs for the little effort they have put into the game as is, just so they can have a red AR instead of black. I have nothing against companies that try to tap into its player base for a little more profit, but when that becomes its mission statement, I have issue. I have issue with that company, I have issue with the community that directly illustrates their support ($$), and I have issue with a game that uses its generic "Early Access" label to hide behind its problems.TL;DR: All of the unsupported b*tching in other negative reviews have some actual truth to them.

It's a full release and includes crates, microtransactions and they split the game to make more money. Battle royale is decent but not worth paying for if you have Rust, Arma 3, etc...Was really greedy of them to make skins not marketable. Forces you to open crates to get skins instead of getting them free.$$$$$

That was the time when the zombie version was good, and the battle royale was better than this crap. Back then the BR was more realistic, more tense and just generally more enjoyable without all these puffy neon skins. There used to be a goddamn zombie mode for the BR part of the game if you wanted to play that. The game broke as soon as it got even slightly successful as Daycrate games got greedy and wanted more money.

Queue estimated wait time is 8 min but instead i had to wait 30 min and after 30 min it says 4 min wait time. Daybreak said they would improve gameplay experience. They promise but dont deliver. when they divided H1Z1 into 2 seperate game modes. They make you pay $20 each which makes no sense as in why they're so money hungry. They couldve simply kept it the way it is and improved on it. But instead they leave a under developed game and seperate it into 2 seperate games in order to Make it "better" for players. That was a poor decision daybreak. I would rather have the old H1Z1 that was already bad instead of having this 2 $20 games that shouldve only been $20 for both experiences of survival and battle royale. Dont buy this game unless it goes back to the wait it used to be.... the better version. Very disappointed. (And whats King of the Kill? rip of off the name king of the hill)

Meme boy	Not Recommended	61.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ezzy/	Honestly I saw a lot of potential in this game but it quickly became apparent that it's just a money grab. Game mechanics have hardly changed since day one, items are being taken out of the game instead of being fixed because it's so buggy your pc would crash sometimes if you threw a molotov. I don't expect this game to survive long enough for it to even go into beta, since it has been alpha early access for more than a year now, and the only things that get added are items and cases so you'll spend more money outside of the €20 you spent on the original game.It's actually very disappointing how bad the game is, because the idea is great and I still like to play it with friends, but the bugs, glitches and crashes really grinds my gears until the point where I don't want to play it anymore.I'm really hoping this game will crash and burn soon, as it deserves.

李氏生菜王 Lettuce King Li	Recommended	798.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/555Vikki/	H1Z1 BR is a great game. When it comes to the survival mode, the map seems a little bit small for me. However, the map is great for the Battle Royale mode. The only problem with the game is the issue of players using hacks in games. I know DayBreak has been banning tons of people who hack, but the issue still remains. I still recommend this game but it may be a bit boring if you play too many games.

At the start of the month (Feb. 2016) they gave notice that come February 17 2016, they`ll scrape the free to play model and split the game into two titles, as follows:- H1Z1: Just Survive @ $19.99 (your standard multiplayer survival) - H1Z1: King of the Kill @ $19.99 ("competitive" game modes like Battle Royale)New players, avoid this, you`re esentially paying double for the same content we already have and they`re not even out yet, who knows how many business model changes this will undergo. Great game or not, vote with your wallet and do not support unethical business practices. Bleh.

After coming back to see how this game is doing, I cant help but think its a joke. People who seem to think this game is any good is in denial. Its just a money grab for daybreak.  PUBG has done more in 3 months than KOTK has done in a year.  One game gets actual updates like new maps, guns, major bug fixes, optimization, ect. The other gets updates like new skins.....thats it..just new skins that you have to buy.If you want a good battle royal buy PUBGIf you want a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ fashion show with guns. Buy this game

Hot steaming garbage. The bugs and blatant balancing issues that have been in this game since launch are still here and probably won't change. They cut the already♥♥♥♥♥♥content in half and have the balls to ask for more money for BOTH games. I've given it time and yet nothing changes. Hey, do you want to float in the air in the start of a BR for 45 seconds? Only to land to be gunned down by someone with loot already? Good! Now enjoy queueing again. Want to get shot through walls because the netcode is so♥♥♥♥♥♥that your movement means nothing? Want someone to drive at you in a vehicle going 90 mph only to jump out 5 feet from you and have their model lag behind so you can't remotely get a shot? Want to get gang ♥♥♥♥ed in solo BR? Want to spawn in random forests with one ♥♥♥♥ing building so you can spend 20 minutes walking to the safe zone, just to get slaughtered by someone who actually got loot? The list goes on. Don't worry though, those will never get fixed, but hey, at least they can add more crates!!!! These devs want money, nothing more, nothing less. Until they get their heads on straight, this game will always be a terribly optimized, buggy, unbalanced, turd.

Its fun and addictive until you start questioning things, then it becomes monotonous, tedius and just plain rage inducing.These 'things' include, but are not limited to, hackers, lack of content, bullets not registering, sniper shotguns and more hackers. Yeah this game really could do without the hackers! Either way it is good fun and I'm having a blast, just don't question things and you'll love it.

Stripstroke	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/stripstroke/	I saw the game leave early access so I thought I might as well give this a shot, even though I was disappointed with the direction this game has taken. I've owned this game since day one, with the game getting rebranded 3 times and reworked on I lost all hope of ever getting back the H1Z1 I paid for and loved. This game is not good, not one bit seriously there's nothing here that other battle royal games don't do better. Why is this even called H1Z1 there's no zombies nothing... Daybreak didn't just sweep this under the rug like other companies, they buried this game 6 feet under and ironically they still hope they can turn it around. If you guys just stuck with the original concept and design you sold to everyone none of this would have happened the damn game was a success and now it's not even close to what it was.Daybreak is scum they ruin everything they touch, play what you want enjoy it I'm not one to tell you what to do but think twice before supporting this company. We've all been burned before and it'll happen again! I'll never buy anything from them again and I haven't since H1Z1 originally released.
ITASHI UCHIHO	Not Recommended	286.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/namzeee/	Great game with great potential; extremely addictive and fun AT TIMES.Now that thats off the list:HIT REG:The ♥♥♥♥ing idiots at daybreak are the litersal worst game designers in the world. These ♥♥♥♥ing morons have NO CLUE on how to design hit registration with ANY of the guns in the game beside maybe the sniper rifle. THE SHOTGUN is an especially ♥♥♥♥♥♥ example of daybreak's failures as a company. DESYNC:These clowns have no idea how to manage their servers with people ♥♥♥♥ing BULLETING THROUGH THE GROUND into the darkness of the void and people being able to sprint through walls and not rubber band back whilst lagging giving laggers (USUALLY CHINESE) an extreme advantage in the game.MAP ISSUES:Gaybreak has designed the worst ♥♥♥♥ing BR map of ALL TIME, FLUTTERED with invisible collisions that destroy your car or do other stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥GLITCHES IN GENERAL:I'm convinced this company hasnt tested their game ♥♥♥♥ing once. There are SO MANY glitches in this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game its hilarious, with people dying randomly from environment to people performing a goddamn ET and floating into the sky.IN CONCLUSION:H1 is a game with so much potential to be good, the concept and gameplay mechanics are on ♥♥♥♥ing point, but jesus christ...

MortalOmega	Not Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mortalomega/	If this game played like the preview i would have payed $60, but this was always supposed to be a completely free game with optional cosmetic microtransactions. The only reason it is still preorder is because they promised free on release. This game could be so much better, like in the trailer, if you could charge a guy with an axe and have a chance against a gun. I think a machete or axe takes less than 20 hits to kill someone. That should be the risk and reward charging a gun. Right now its all open areas dominated by shotguns and rifles (too common). They should make areas as if they are making a map for any other pvp game, or at least take out the endless forests you spend forever running through only to get killed and respawn right back in the middle.Right now the game looks like it could be great but these morons cant seem to stop focusing on making us buy skins. There seems to be no hope for this game at all.

Clickbait Cancer	Not Recommended	68.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tbets/	This game was the first "Battle Royale" type game I had ever played. Honestly, I can't stand this game, it's so clunky, hit detection is awful, too many shotgun users, terrible render distances. Too much emphasis on crates and skins, feels like the devs only care about microtransactions rather than improving the game.This game almost turned me off completely of Battle Royals type games. I was urged to get PUBG by a bunch of friends, when I finally gave in I was hooked. PUBG is 1000x better than this game. I already have almost twice the amount of time played in PUBG than this game, and I've owned King of The Kill since it and Just Survive were one single game. Pass on this garbage and spend a bit more to get PUBG.Lol @ all the people saying I'm just bad. I guess everyone that hates other♥♥♥♥♥♥games like COD is just bad too?

Mizowski	Not Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mizowski/	Look, honestly this game is fun, but man it's buggy as hell. The best part of this game is playing with friends and when you get into groups of 5, you'll often find that 1 of you crashes upon starting up. This game has been out for a long time and they still haven't fixed it. There are plenty of other bugs too. A lot of the time my game will even crash while starting up.But the real reason I'm writing this review is because they saw that their game became successful and decided to split it into 2 games charging the original $20 for each game totalling $40 now. HELL NO! WTH! You can't just up the price of a game like that! It's been out for at least a year and now you are doubling the price. Are you serious?! This was supposed to be a F2P game upon release and usually the longer games are out the less they cost, but you are one of the few companies to go the other way. Way to trash your companies name for some extra dough, which probably isn't even going to be that much. And the worst part is, your game is still just about as glitchy as when you started.
Oliver	Not Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088920068/	This game is fun if you already have it, but after the microtransactions and both games being $20 each after the game split it isn't worth buying. (Fix your♥♥♥♥♥♥Daybreak)

The "other" game is the zombie survival remember?Honestly not the end of the world that they split the games and going back on the free2play is no big deal either if.... THEY WOULD ADD SOME CONTENT TO THE GAME! Could be great game guys come on already and deliver something you can be proud of.

Trocks	Recommended	45.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trocks334/	The amount of hate for this game is astronomical, yet warrented.I have a "clan" of about 5-10 guys mostly based in the east coast of the U.S, for the longest time, we would only play two games, CS GO and Civ 5.  As you can imagine, it eventually got stale and was slowly toxifying our relationship due to the nature of CS GO and Civ 5.  I should mention that we are a mostly competitive group, so getting dicked on in Civ or berating each other in CS GO was getting old after 1-2 years.Eventually, two of the people in our group decided to pick up the game, much to my disgust.  I remember when it was supposed to be free, then it became $20, then they split it up into TWO games for $20 each which left me appalled.  I also had a VERY sour taste in my mouth for early access after Cubeworld, DayZ Standalone, and about every other Early Access game that had come out.  Yet my two friends raved and raved about how much fun they were having, to which I would respond "50% rating on steam".  Well, after deranking from LEM in CS GO, I decided that I was done with that game for a while, and I needed something else to take my attention.  I ended up playing a lot of The Division, which was another game chock full of broken promises, but I enjoyed it a lot.  So I eventually got tired of The Division and caved in and bought the game, and man oh man was I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when I first launched it.  I crashed out of my first 3 games.  Which is ridiculous considering I have an i5 4440 and a GTX 970.  After 3 hours of troubleshooting I launched it up and went into my first solo game.  I got 9th place, and was hooked.If any of you have ever played minecraft hunger games or even vanilla rust, you know the feeling of adrenaline when you get into an intense fight.  This game delivers, and rewards you time and time again for your aim *not the shitgun though*.  My friends and I were laughing at the bugs *cars doing gymnastic flips* and working together as a team in Fives.  Losing does not feel that bad in this game as you can instantly load into another one without having to worry about any "rank  loss" *cough* CS GO *cough*.  All in all, this game is a bug riddled mess with greedy♥♥♥♥♥developers, but if your looking for a game to just load up and play with friends, then I think this is the game for you.

Pros Ranking systemAction packedLoot system is goodYou can find guns quicklySkins and various clothes Cons No tutorial.You get thrown into the game INSTANTLY with pro players.No gun attachments1st person is uselessperformance issues (the interior wont load and you can get stuck, textures are buggy)hit registry is a jokeIt's really difficult for new players to learn to play"Training" is ridiculousGlitches and bugsThere are 9 guns, from which you will only use 2 - AR-15 and shotgun (maybe AK-47)Shotguns are wayyy too OP in my opinion.Everybody goes to the same town, where all of the action ends. 175+ players go for the same f*cking town. Think about it.There are only 4 vehicles - quadbike, jeep, police sedan, pickup truck.If you are a noob, most of the time you will wait for map to load.Better save your money and buy PUBG.

Tried 5 five times to play it unsuccessfully and decided not to bother anymore. That`s all I had to review.If you want a Oreo Cake recipe read this:For the Cake:3/4 cup (about 3 3/4 ounces) all-purpose flour1/4 cup (about 3/4 ounce) cocoa powder1/2 plus 1/8 teaspoon baking soda1/8 teaspoon salt1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (about 4 1/3 ounces) granulated sugar1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons sour cream1/3 cup vegetable oil1 large egg1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extractFor the Oreo whipped cream:50 Oreo cookies4 1/2 cups heavy cream2 tablespoons granulated sugar1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract1.Make cake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 350°. Line bottom of a 9-inch cake pan with parchment paper and lightly coat the inside with non-stick pan spray. Sift flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt into large bowl; set aside. In medium bowl, whisk sugar, sour cream, oil, eggs, and vanilla until smooth.2.Whisk wet ingredients into dry ingredients until smooth. Pour batter into pan and bake until cake is just firm and toothpick inserted into center comes out with moist crumbs, 20 to 25 minutes. Let cake cool in pan for 15 minutes, then remove from pan to completely cool on wire rack, about 1 hour.3.Carefully cut 6 Oreo cookies in half; set aside. Chop remaining cookies into 1/4-inch pieces; set aside.4.To Assemble Cake: make the Oreo whipped cream in 2 batches. In bowl of standing mixer fitted with whip attachment, whip 2 cups cream on medium-high speed to soft peak, spoon into large bowl and refrigerate. In same mixer bowl, whip remaining 2 1/2 cups cream, sugar, and vanilla to soft peak. Fold into already whipped cream.5.Place about 1 cup whipped cream in bowl and refrigerate until ready to decorate cake. Fold chopped Oreos into remaining whipped cream.6.Slice cake in half horizontally to create 2 layers. Place bottom layer on serving plate. Spread about 1/3 of Oreo whipped cream onto cake. Top with second cake layer and use remaining Oreo whipped cream to frost top and sides of cake. Chill in refrigerator for about 2 hours to allow cookies to soften.7.Place reserved whipped cream in pastry bag fitted with star tip (re-whisk if necessary). Pipe 12 whipped cream rosettes around perimeter of cake and garnish with reserved Oreo cookie halves. Serve.

And the game is not that optimzed as well. If they give a refund for the players that brought the game since Beta and ect then most players will be happy because they baselly wasted $20 usd on the game that is dead.-BYanni

I know that's not alot, but it's enough for me, to make a opinion about the game, and make a review about it. Pros Ranking systemAction packedLoot system is goodYou can find guns quicklySkins and various clothes Cons No tutorial.You get thrown into the game INSTANTLY with pro players.No gun attachments1st person is uselessperformance issues (the interior wont load and you can get stuck, textures are buggy)hit registry is a jokeIt's really difficult for new players to learn to play"Training" is ridiculousGlitches and bugsThere are 9 guns, from which you will only use 2 - AR-15 and shotgun (maybe AK-47)Shotguns are wayyy too OP in my opinion.Everybody goes to the same town, where all of the action ends. 175+ players go for the same f*cking town. Think about it.There are only 4 vehicles - quadbike, jeep, police sedan, pickup truck.If you are a noob, most of the time you will wait for map to load.Better save your money and buy PUBG. This game is pile of doo-doo. It's imposible for newbies to play, it's has poor performance, and it gets boring really quickly.

Then I decided instead fo doing normal BRs how about I try zombie BR. Doing really well, get a jeep get fully geared up, I get up the mountain after outrunning another jeep trying to kill me.. Only to get shot through the wall by a hacker. Its been over a year longer than that and these guys still ahve not got their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. THE GAME IS FULL OF HACKERS! Why play a survival game thats full of hackers, their are many games out there that are successful at getting these people out so I know its not impossible.. But you guys are pathetic glad I never wasted a cent buying your stupid skins ethier. Go ahead get the top ten in a BR, how about even 2nd or 1st place... Guess what? You ge the same stupid ♥♥♥♥ing shirt over and over... This game is done, im gonna let it burn and im not supporting anything this company puts out anymore!

KieranDevvs	Not Recommended	10.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KieranDevvs/	Its been out for a year now and theres still no new weapons or content in the game. You either find an AR15, Shotgun, AK47 a pistol, helmet, body armour, bow, moltov, grenade, flash, or one of 3 pistols. Thats literally the spawn options. In ARMA 3 you get all of the A3 weapons (50+) and more with mods, even in rust you get more of an option and the games not even supposed to support battle royal.I understood this when H1Z1: just survive and king of the kill were one game as the zombies and the survival were the main priority as thats what the game was but now they have made it into a standalone I expect to see much more, so far the only thing ive noticed is the hit markers and bug fixes.

SUCC	Not Recommended	571.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198316399527/	You know after countless hours put into this game the developers completley ruined this game. It was a fun game where me and my friends you used to have a good time playing the game, but after the combat update or somewhere around that time the developers ruined it trying to make it like pubg and destroying the game it used to be. The best times i could remember are around preseason 3. Those where the days where we would just grind and have fun. At this point the developers dont even listen to people and dont change anything so it's basically a lost cause at this point. I finally decided to put in a review because it seems like everyone else is and the problems needed to be addressed even tho multiple people have addressed these problems but DayBreak Games has done nothing but continually put out horrible updates and ruin the game. They changed Movement,Gun Sounds (Which gun sounds can be an okay change but DayBreak did it horribley) they also changed aiming mechanics and basically everything their was about the game. The main this i noticed is they got rid of E-nassing or however its spelled which some people would say this is good but i thought it was a fun part of the game because you would be able to dodge bullets and if u had no cover around at least have a slim chance. Another thing i realized they changed was it wasnt a random spawn anymore you would now choose your location which is so stupid. At this point the only players playing this game are Royalyt's and higher ranks because theirs no point, the only people that are play are New Players and Day 1 players. Mostly everyone has given up on this game which includes me. I dont really have much else to say but now that it's free to play if u wanna try out the game go ahead but for us people who have been playing since preseason 2 the game has a completley different feel.

Taylor Swift	Recommended	741.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mamodio/	Personally I do enjoy this game and while this game certainly does have its ups and downs, I am not here to praise or criticize this game.  I am here to offer a phenomenal 4 Cheese Ravioli recipe!Here are the ingredients you will need!Ravioli Dough: 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 pinch salt, 1 teaspoon olive oil, 2 eggs, 1 1/2 tablespoons water.Ravioli Filling: 1 (8 ounce) container ricotta cheese, 1 (4 ounce) package cream cheese, softened, 1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup provolone cheese, shredded, 1 egg, 1 1/2 teaspoons dried parsley.Pesto-Alfredo Cream Sauce: 2 tablespoons olive oil, 2 cloves garlic, crushed, 3 tablespoons prepared basil pesto sauce, 2 cups heavy cream, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1 (24 ounce) jar marinara sauce.1. Mound the flour and salt together on a work surface and form a well. Beat the teaspoon of olive oil, 2 eggs, and water in a bowl. Pour half the egg mixture into the well. Begin mixing the egg with the flour with one hand; use your other hand to keep the flour mound steady. Add the remaining egg mixture and knead to form a dough.2. Knead the dough until smooth, 8 to 10 minutes; add more flour if the dough is too sticky. Form the dough into a ball and wrap tightly with plastic. Refrigerate for 1 hour.3. While the dough is resting, prepare the ravioli filling. Combine the ricotta cheese, cream cheese, mozzarella cheese, provolone cheese, egg, and parsley and mix well. Set the filling aside.4. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the crushed garlic and pesto sauce and cook for one minute. Pour in the heavy cream, raise the heat to high, and bring the sauce to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Add the Parmesan cheese and stir until the cheese melts. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.5. Meanwhile, in a separate saucepan, warm the marinara sauce over medium-low heat.6. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Beat the egg with the tablespoon of water to make the egg wash.7. Roll out the pasta dough into thin sheets no thicker than a nickel. To assemble the ravioli, brush the egg wash over a sheet of pasta. Drop the filling mixture on the dough by teaspoonfuls about one inch apart. Cover the filling with the top sheet of pasta, pressing out the air from around each portion of filling. Press firmly around the filling to seal. Cut into individual ravioli with a knife or pizza cutter. Seal the edges.8. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Stir in the ravioli, and return to a boil. Cook uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the ravioli float to the top and the filling is hot, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain well.9. Grease a baking sheet. Place the cooked ravioli on the sheet pan and bake in the preheated oven until brown, about 4 minutes.10. To serve the ravioli, divide them among four warmed serving bowls. Drizzle the marinara sauce over the ravioli and then top with the cream sauce.

Long ago they announced that after beta the game will be free, and now they cut the game into 2 games in order to milk this planetside 2 engine, don't get your hopes up with this, the bullet detection and the non-existent anti-cheat makes this game unplayable if you don't have someone to play with, and this game gets boring really fast, wait in lobby, people saying china number 1, spawn with parachute, land, get killed by someone who already has everything they could ever need, repeat

MrTrippy	Not Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034138902/	(My playtime is very low as its the first time playing since the H1Z1 game split)I really don't know where to start.. I tried to play for just over an hour, about 15 minutes was actual game play. The game constantly gets stuck on loading screens (entering the game or loading the lobby) and only took me back to menu once after a game, the rest of the time it crashed.Graphically the newer map does look better but its still nothing amazing and the sounds are mediocre at best.As for the gameplay, its exactly how I remember it being before the split; Awful. I drove my car at full speed right through a player and he got away without a scratch... Then later on while being chased full speed by a police car, the passenger jumps out (still at full speed) and instantly 1 shot kills me while I'm still driving.If you want a very arcadey/broken game, buy this. But be warned, you'll want to smash something out of frustration!Save your money for when PlayerUnknowns BattleGrounds comes out, that game is legit!

Toasty	Not Recommended	80.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/toasty420/	The idea of the game is quite good, and the general gameplay very fun, but it is insanely broken.- Are you and your mate playing duos and one of you die? Well the only thing that person can do is stare at where their killer was when they killed them, and nothing else. You can quit the match, but guess what? You won't get♥♥♥♥♥♥from playing then! It's the same in solos, if you die, you have to wait until the game is over, possibly for an hour, doing ♥♥♥♥all before you get anything from playing.- I've played it for 11 hours, and I haven't gotten a single piece of currency at all.- The aiming is wonky as absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- The inventory system is confusing- Wanna customize your character? The game says "F*ck off, unless you pay us a ♥♥♥♥ton to MAYBE get what you want ;)"- The game would be great if you could have benefits from working with random people, kinda like in DayZ.Overall generally a good game, unpolished as sh*t.

This is my personal experience but i never had to wait more than 5 seconds to join a game, it is pretty hard to get started as you will play against pro's and tryhards that have been here for some time but than again fortnite or PUBG have this problem to(wich is not really a problem it's normal for any game tho some kind of MM would be nice so you don't have biginers playing against pro's) and the gunplay ain't half bad, better than the random hit's you get in fortnite, on PUBG i don't rlly know as i never played it so i won't open that can of worms but to me this game ain't that bad and because it's free there is no point in not trying it

I wont deny the fact that I have had fun with friends over the past 2 years, presplit it wasnt actually all that bad. But Daybreak had to come along and massively ♥♥♥♥ over the game.Splitting it into H1Z1: JS and KOTK was the biggest ♥♥♥♥ing cash grab move ive ever seen in a game, and is pretty funny that they said it was going to be free to play...Now they can massively rip you off by charging TWICE as much for the two games! Wonderful! And the fact that instead of making the game better they just add more microtransactions and even more ways to rip you the ♥♥♥♥ off. If it wasnt for the fact that I had no other way to play BR then this game would have been uninstalled and refunded months ago. If you are looking for a real BR game that isnt riddled with microtransactions and ridiculous looking clothing, then just go by PlayerUnknown's Battelgrounds. Ive already had more fun in PUBG in 10 hours than I have in the entirety of H1Z1. This game should have been out of early access years ago and its a big F U to other games that actually deserve to be in early access. ♥♥♥♥ daybreak and their money grabbing schemes.

dropicz.	Recommended	387.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dropicz/	You can spend hours a day playing this game and trying to improve your skill. I love that it's not only a casual game. The competitive scene is getting bigger and bigger. The solo, duo and five ranking system is awesome.positive:- addictivity- solo/team ranking- always many players online -> short wait- every 5 level a free crate- fun with friends- "fast" games because of the gas- playable for rushers, campers, solo players, team players...- in my opinion, 19,99€ is a fair pricenegative:- still a lot of bugs- hitreg- sometimes server problems- might be a rough start for beginnersIf you get along with the bugs you can really enjoy the game. In my opinion, a must have for shooter players. I'm curious about future updates.best 20€ in my life ᕦ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)ᕤ

Hois	Not Recommended	171.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045008134/	Okay I'm gonna start this off with the fact that for the most part, King of The Kill can be a very fun game to play with friends. Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy bastards who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared♥♥♥♥♥♥all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10.

Because the developers' heads are so far up their Asian market's♥♥♥♥♥ they never bothered to do anything about the high pings and cheating until it was too late. Instead of fixing very common bugs, they released crate after crate, further showing the player base that they were not interested in anything but their money. It wasn't a shock that once there was a viable contender in the battle royale genre that H1 lost players by the truck load.

Btw i live in NA and get 90ms ping for no reason and my internet is top notch wtf.It just goes to show you how some untalented devs can make a crappy game, give it the early access title, and make bank. It should be a crime honestly. Its all just greed. They put no effort into this game anymore. They just put it out and called it a decade. Rip this game from releasing. I could swear i saw they were going to release it somwhere but it is still tagged as EA and it should stay that way cuz its still trash. ♥♥♥♥ u daybreak, your a bunch of lousy c unts and you deserve your money to be taken like you have taken ours and then u should be nailed to crosses, I hope u feel terrible about yourselves, goodbye.

zcdc	Not Recommended	310.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zcdc/	I've only been playing for a couple of months but I can tell you that this game is nowhere near ready to be played on the large scale it is now. There are still a ton of issues and the development team seems to take two steps back after moving one forward with every patch or update. The problem for me was that as a new player there is absolutely no way to properly train. The practice/training mode is just plain terrible as you can never find any loot, the weapons don't re-spawn apparently. It took me almost a month to get any confidence at all in gun fights because the only way you can practice for it is to queue a game and hope you land in a populated area and fight as often as possible. The problem is that a lot of these players have been playing for so long that they've mastered two tapping or first person shotgunning. Meaning that unless you get the jump (hiding) on them you stand almost no chance.The amount of two taps I've been getting is insane; I can't even play the ♥♥♥♥ing game anymore. Every encounter is now 5 shots or less. If you don't immediately two tap you're dead. What is the point of even looting for body armor when my last 7 or 8 deaths out of 10 are from a series of head shots in under 2 seconds. If there was a way to improve helmets to take additional shots I wouldn't be in such a rage at the moment but still...The game also has probably the worst development team in recent memory. Every "update" causes more issues, the hit registration is still off and there still is some bug or glitch I encounter that ruins my game around 5-10% of the time. They are either severely understaffed or incompetent, neither bodes well for them. I'm ashamed to say I spent around $60 to get crates for new skins and that wasn't even enough to get an ultra rare item. I'm done giving my money and time. I'll patiently wait until someone else develops a similar game and play that instead. The only reason I've played as long as I have is because it's a unique and fun (when there aren't bugs/issues) but I've simply had enough.

XENOCIDE [ALT]	Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/XENOCIDESAMALT/	OVERALL RATING: 8/10In-game Time: 275+ Hours [35+ hours shown on "Just Survive" before the game-split 2016]Played Since: December 2015PLEASE NOTE: The account that this review is posted from has zero in-game time. However, I have 170+ hours on H1Z1 on my main account. Check out my main account here:XENOCIDEINTRODUCTION: H1Z1 is a highly thrilling open world shooter that will grip you for hours upon hours with intense and tactical gameplay. Drop into Solos, Duos, or Fives - in the classic Battle Royale style to fight for your place, until you are the only one that remains. Alternatively, hop into a car in a team of four in Auto Royale - facing other teams of four in a demolition derby style Battle Royale.POSITIVES: - Great use of multiplayer using huge servers taking advantage of the mass of land with the usual Solo game having 150 individual players, Duos 150 (75 pairs), Fives 150 (30 teams), and Auto Royale 100 teams (25 teams).- Great fun alone as well as the option of two-player duos, or five-player teams - allowing the use of lone combat or collaborating with friends (or searching for random teammates) utilising tactics, communication, and skill to be the last team left.- The new game mode addition, Auto Royale! A never seen before Battle Royale concept that encompasses a demolition derby style with teams of four fighting it out with the use of perks and weaponry to be the last vehicle standing.- Really nice skin system, loads available, all at good prices - lets you spice your character, weapons, and vehicles up a bit so you don't all look bland and alike.- No "Pay to Win" element to the game. All purchasable products are simply cosmetic, which allows you to have fun but doesn't give an unfair advantage to those who have access to Daddy's Credit Card ;)NEGATIVES: - Quite a few bugs are needed to be fixed regularly, which often seem to take much time to correct; although the development team are sharpening up with patches.- The userbase is nowhere near the 150,000 it used to be - recently dipping down to a mere 10,000 gamers; meaning games may take a minute or so to begin. However, since going Free to Play numbers are rising and queue times seem to be improving.SUMMARY: I believe, as well as many others, that the games basis and concept is amazing, but the current developers and design is what lets it down slightly; it seems to just have something missing and needs focused development to get it stable and then further expand. However it truly is a worthwhile game to play (especially as it is has gone Free to Play - if you don't like it you can simply uninstall it and not worry you have wasted your hard earned money), just be aware of its current minor flaws and needed tweaks. The game is on the up with development however, with combat, vehicles, movement, and a new game mode making it an attractive purchase to make - especially as it's now free.

Hois	Not Recommended	171.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045008134/	Okay I'm gonna start this off with the fact that for the most part, King of The Kill can be a very fun game to play with friends. Killing others is satisfying and the gunplay has a learning curve that may take a while to get used to (it took me about 2 months). I personally feel like i got my 20 dollars worth. However, this game has more issues tan you can count. The main issue is that the developers are greedy bastards who just want yor money and don't really seem to care about anything but your money. This game was intended to be free to play after it was finished, but just recently they made the content that was oroginally $20 to $40. Instead of giving us updates with bug fixes and more content that will make the game more complete, the devs decided that they would spend the majority of their time just harvesting our money via case openings. The developers priorities are ♥♥♥♥ing embarrasing, sorry for the language. A few months ago they removed molotov cocktails since they had some sort of bug going on with them. They haven't been put back in the game, and im assuming the devs just figured we'd forget about them because the update after they removed, they decided we didnt want fixed game mechanics, instead we wanted new undies. That's right, they released an update after removing the molotovs thats main purpose was to add a few new character skins, and change the color of their underwear. I honestly can't understand their thought process when they first started the game it had such promise, but now they've smeared♥♥♥♥♥♥all over those promises and made themselves possibly the worst developers of all time. Buy this game if you like killing people and simply that. If you expect the game to be more than justs uing the same guns and cars every game, you will be dissapointed. The game lacks content severly, but it is damn fun to kill someone who's been trash talking you (which will happen pretty much every game since the community is just a bunvh of edgy children)If I were to give this game the rating it truely deserves it would be a 1/10.

Arsonist	Not Recommended	1,827.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Identitarian/	DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH !!! I I pre ordered this game pre alpha and enjoyed every second of it on Z1, but Z2 is a nightmare and how much of a joke this game has become and the company that develops it is sad. I have been Royalty every season and loved this game, but after pre season 3 the game went to complete trash, for months Daybreak did nothing to fix the game until PUBG came out in March and then Daybreak started doing pointless updates such as adding colors for vehicles, and an absurd amount of POIS in efforts of keeping their player base, but when that started to fail they decided let's make a combat update and take key elemets that make PUBG a great game such as tracers and a compass but scuf them and no one will know. This past combat update has ruined the game in my opinion to the point of no return, there is absolutley no skill gap on this game at all anymore, someone can buy the game a day ago and full spray 2 tap or just flat out full spray you to death even if you are a veteran player, how does this create an equal level playing field on a game that prides itself on not having attachments and wanting to create a skill gap. The developers on this game are so bad at their job, that they can't even fix a shotgun so they add an MP7 to further the already non existant skill gap, and to top it off they thought it would be an amazing idea to add bloom to the game which has killed off other games. The numbers on steam charts and Twitch don't lie H1Z1 is dying and it's because the developers don't know what they are doing. I can't play the current state of the game for more then an hour anymore, which is sad because before  I used to spend a whole day playing it having fun. And the tactic they are using right now to hype up their invitational at twitchcon by paying streamers like joshog and summit1g to stream their game and have them participate in the event is only a temporary solution to a dying player count, because once the event is over with, people won't want to play this trash anymore. These updates they do to supposedly fix the game only make the game much worse.

Simplexes h1z1hunt.com	Not Recommended	1,529.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Simplexes/	I want to start this review off by saying, I use to love this game I use to enjoy it, even after the combat update, aka the pub g update, which turned this game to♥♥♥♥♥♥ This new season 1 update had a lot of good stuff, but one thing has made this game unplayable for me, which is the new ranking system. This use to be a fast paced BR, that had high risk, high reward, not so much anymore. Now you get rewarded for playing like a ♥♥♥♥♥ because of this new ranking system which is based off consistency..Which in return makes you play serious 100% of the time. If you want to play for fun or go for kills it hurts your rank significantly. The old system was just based around kills, which made the game fun because everyone wanted to get high kill games. So, people challenged everything. Now people just drive away after getting shot 1 time, its pathetic.These devs are one of the most incompetent devs you'll run across..The word "revert" does not exist in their vocabulary. If they bring something back which should of never been taken out in the first place there will be a compromise EVERY TIME. Examples, dropshot, they add it back except now it takes at least 4 seconds to get up instead of getting up almost instantly which makes drop shot kinda pointless. AR recoil, they removed horizontal recoil out of the game, added vertical which people didn't like. Instead of reverting they make the ar have horizontal and vertical. Another example, people ask for 325 bullet speed down from 800 I think it was. instead of putting it back at 325 they go to 500..Instead of adding old bullet drop back they add their own version off bullet drop. People ask for ps3 colors and textures. Instead of reverting they just change the time of day to 8am with the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures.. Every single update these devs come out with they go two steps forward and 10 steps back. The two steps forward will be QOL features. The 10 steps back will be changing something in the game which no one asked for (which they will just add back months later because of complaints).. Instead of progressing with the game they will spend months on adding stuff they took out. Oh, also, best believe when a new update comes out except a♥♥♥♥♥♥load of bugs. Daybreak likes changing stuff that doesnt need to be changed and stuff that no one asks for. Then when people say put it back the way it use to they respond with the stupidest cop out. "Its not important, it doesnt change the gameplay at all, and we need to worry about bigger things." So, why change it in the first place? If you dont know what im referring to, im referring to changing the old weapon models, not be able to have 2 different types of helmets, changing the UI, and many other things which im forgetting right now. Instead of listening to people db does♥♥♥♥♥♥their own way, for example, people ask them to remove the headlights off of cop cars. What do they do? They make it where you cant shoot over the damn headlights or headglitch anything in the game.The game is invested with hackers right now since its free to play. Which makes the game unplayable at times. To make it worse the devs dont compensate you in any way when you die to a cheater.. I wouldnt really care dying to a hacker that much, put the fact it hurts your rank really pisses me off. In the previous ranking system it wouldnt effect you at all if you died to a cheater.This game alienates veteran players. You'll grind for hours remembering bullet speed and bullet drop just for a update to come out that changes it, the thing that makes it worse is you'll grind again just for them to change it again and again and again... So, all those hours you put in doesn't mean♥♥♥♥♥♥The game is not optimized at all...Well sometimes.. So, this game will run fine for about 30min to an hour then just run like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Instead of fixing fps for the last year, this devs want to add new pois to the game! Which makes fps worse and worse..I dont know how a game gets worse optimization every update.. Its mind blowing you think after 3 years they will eventually get it. But nope, what makes it worse is this game micro stutters every 5 to 10 sec if you dont disable nvdia shadow play or close very program on your pc except h1. Even having discord open adds a lot of microstutters. The shotgun is another thing that has ruined the experience for me and others. They can never seem to get it right. So my question is, why is it still in the game or why isnt it 2 shot like in ps3? The shotgun in this game is way to inconsistent but way to powerful at the same time. This new shotgun is perfect for cod rushers who dont know how to shoot their AR or AK straight. Cod rushing really ruins the gameplay also. Kids always force shotty fights. Ill be fine with it because ill just try to out gun them, but its impossible because of how inconsistent the shotgun is. You can also get sniped from 10m away with this broken gun which is insane.Nade spamming also ruins the game. The nades are way to powerful right now. First thing someone does when they see some one in this game is throw something..I don't blame them nades are way to effective a nade can 1 shot you, mollys take away 30 damage instantly and a lot of times you weren't even near the molly. I miss when h1 was revolved more around gunskill than lethals. Most people didn't even run nades beofre because most of the time they wouldn't even go off. You may say thats broken but I prefer it that way because nades negatively impact the game and are way to OP right now.Things they need to add to make this game good again..Remove the headlights off cop cars, allow headglitching. Add old z1 dropshot, jump shoot, and seat swap. Revert to the old ranking system. Remove most of the new garbage pois they added which killed this game. Revert old bullet drop and speed. Old ps3 textures, grass, and trees. Old helmet system and old weapons models. They need to bring back the old animations, the new animations on characters look trash. The old UI. Remove the mp7 and readd the r380. Fix the microstutters and fps. Better loot in buildings, campsites, and houses. Either make shotgun 2 shot every time or remove it. Fix the overpowered nade meta. db needs to make a system where they cant change anything in the game without the majority opinion with polls. They need to add west coast servers back, there is only one server which is on east coast so if you live on the west you get anywhere from 90-120 ping. Which causes massive D-Sync. They need to fix d-sync. I understand thats not something you can just change but I have 10-20ms I shouldn't be getting d-synced as much as I do. Most of the d-sync has to come from awful coding.

THump	Not Recommended	394.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TTHump/	Pretty much nothing has changed in the past 12 months. Game still crashes randomly.. still get infinite loading screen. Shotgun is still terribly RNG. Added a new spawning system where you can select where you land which leads to getting anally clapped over and over again from the back. Feels like i'm playing a bukakke simulator. Movement is terrible.. can't turn right or left without feeling like you're standing on top of a pancake with 1000000 pounds of syrup on it. I have 5000 hours on this game and the first day of the new update I've died to nothing but shotguns over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over over and over and over again. Combat style is still completely boring even after we complained about the combat.. instead of adding other ways to outplay people they only change the gun recoils. I also have been streaming for 2 hours today and I've only gotten $50 dollars in donations for playing this♥♥♥♥♥♥hole game which is honestly the biggest problem. That's $25 an hour for those who can't count that are reading this... that means that I'm equivalent to a ♥♥♥♥ing dental hygentist. Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? I go through the depths of ♥♥♥♥ing mordor every single ♥♥♥♥ing day waking up wanting to end it all FOR $25 D OLLARS AND HOUR HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥DO NOT PLAYING THIS ♥♥♥♥ING GAME I BEG YOU SAVE YOURSELF AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

Johnny Bravo	Not Recommended	292.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077352573/	Used to be the best Battle Royale game out there but the developers just started doing their own thing and ♥♥♥♥ed it all up. The game is dead and takes longer and longer to find lobbies, most of the time you wont get a full lobby by the time the game has started. If the developers actually listened to their die hard players this game could have a small chance, a very small chance, at making a comeback. But god knows they wont, they will just add more and more crates into the damn game to try and squeeze the rest of the money out of the players before this whole game comes to an end. ♥♥♥♥ you daybreak

Grahto	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/grahto/	I bought this game when it was on special. I struggled to find any decent servers with players. Loot was so repetitive it wasn't even funny, found about a dozen AK's in one location with nothing really else around.Now it's just come out of pre-access and didn't even have an update. So it's the same game it was a month ago, they just decided to claim it was now a "full game"I played it for a round before shutting it and re-opening PUBG.... By the looks of the comments, this game is dead and it sounds like it was killed by greedy and lazy developers who cared more about selling $5 hoodies than developing a playable game.
Melolix	Not Recommended	403.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Melolix/	just dont buy this game! go and buy PubG or Fortnite you will have way more fun. Daybreak did nothing untill PubG came out. now they just copy the ideas from PubG. so if you want a good BR game dont play H1Z1 go and play Fortnite or PubG

Recu	Not Recommended	3.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/recu/	If you played PUBG and you like it then H1Z1 is definitly not for u. + Optimilization is good+ you get some free crates with skins every 5 levels- Aiming with weapons is horrible, one of the worst I ever seen- you get many crates wich you can't open with game wallet and you must pay real money to open them

Q-['-'Q]	Recommended	88.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hans3lg/	Lately, I've been frikkin angry with Capcom with how they've messed up with some of my franchises like Street Fighter  and Puzzle Fighter, as well as their decision to release MH XX for more than a year to the west. I was sceptical when they first announced MHW back in e3 2017 and I was like "Really? A MH with realistic current-gen graphics?"... But when it finally came to PC and played, it gave me a nasty surprise...To put it simply, MHW is far more complicated than its predecesors but it's more user-friendly and more comfortable to play. The map now feels like an open world ish unlike area-based environment like it was, where the system needs to go into 3 seconds loading if the hunter moves into a new area. But when I say it's more complicated, I'm talking about the map design here; each map has different levels of ground, meaning roughly 1F to 3F you can access, also there are plenty of grounds to climb, more caves, as a result plenty of navigation to the map. Well that's one hell of a way to get lost rite? Not exactly... The scoutflies are there to help you, they're green glowing flies that guide you into your quest objective, several interactible objects, and also waypoint you put when you're accessing the world map and it just works like your personal GPS actually. The only problem for me at some quests is when I'm trying to find the large monster I needed to hunt. Because the world is larger, Capcom decided to make large monsters to leave tracks so that hunters can easily find them such as footprints, skids, etc. But unless I find one of them around, I need to travel around the big map until I find one unless I open up some online guides on where does the particular monster spawns.The soundtrack is just simply outstanding, when you're fighting against a monster, the music just fits perfectly on how tense your battle is. When the monster is fleeing and you're chasing after it, the music also adapts into it, fiting into the atmosphere and flow of your game. The village theme in this game also simply become my favourite of the series, next to MH2 and MH4.But that's just not the main point that completely sold me into the game here. Capcom completely overhauled the gameplay experience to make the game very comfortable to play. For instance the gathering mecanisms: hunters now instantly grabs herbs, mushrooms, or bugs instead of 3 seconds of animation per grab. Carving, bone gathering, and mining also alot faster, and on top of all, you can just hold the action button to gather until its resource vein completely drains out which makes gathering jobs a lot faster and ease which kept me wondering why only now these mechanisms are implemented because I was frustrated enough about gathering in previous monster hunter games.I used to search for online guides everytime I play previous Monster Hunter series because the game just simply not straight-forward. I need to research myself for the game mechanisms, monsters behavior, as well as guides and tips. But in MHW, the tutorials are way more sophisticated. There are also Research Center in this game; in short, every monsters has its own research levels which if you level it up, your hunter guide's information regarding to particular monsters will grow. It'll display their weaknesses, breakable parts, even dropped items.Potion drinking is a lot more risky; the hunter will start drinking potion immediately with a white bar in your HP gauge starting to regenerate into actual green bar (a.k.a your real HP). This process can either be cancelled by rolling or getting attacked by a monster. If this happens, the healing process will stop and your potion will still be consumed. The great news is, you can still move (or even run) at a slower pace will consuming. Which means, overall consumables became easier but at the same time risky if there are monsters around.Armor skills in this game are more variant than previous series. In the past, players need to have full set of armors in order to activate its armor skills. Here, each armor parts activates a skill. The difference are each skills have wider amount of levels which means if any other source of armor skills stacks the same skill it will level up, also some sets have unique armor skill bonuses if wielded with a full set.The UI in this game provides more information as well. For the first time, players will be able to see damage indicator presented as numbers. The damage indicator will be white color if you hit fortified part of the monsters, while it will be red if you hit their weaknesses. Also with these numbers, hunters will know exactly how damaging each weapon classes differ. Another example of UI tweak is monster's heart rate. While this is not straight-forward, the heart-rate monitor tells you about the monster's state. While enraged, heart rate will increase and sometimes turn into orange ish instead of blue. While exhausted, heart rate will slow down; while weaken, the heart pulse will be smaller than usual.Well, moving on into my cons for this game, first of all the launch isn't that smooth. Multiplayer as for now isn't playable due to server issues, perhaps because players are too hyped, the game's player count reaches above 200.000 which may explain the server is overloaded. I tried to play multiplayer with my friend and unfortunately, it's like almost guaranteed that each of us will be disconnected one by one in the middle of battle. Also when I'm in the game (whether in quests or menu), I often auto-disconnect from the server and I needed to re-connect into the server again, so for now the game is best played offline.Another issue is the system requirements. This game is very demanding that even some high-end PC's won't run well here. I'm running at GTX 970M and I needed to set graphical elements from mid to low setting in 1080p. The explainatory doesn't end there, my GPU is overclocked and it still runs at 50-65 fps range. It's not smooth 60 fps but it's definitely smooth enough and playable. I read that not even the powerful GTX1070 be able to run the game at highest settings in steady 60FPS @1080p. Wow...In conclusion, this is a blast for me. I'd give it 9/10 at the current state but if capcom manages to fix the multiplayers perfectly, this is an easy 10/10. This sequence is undoubtedly the best on the series by the massive jump in quality and content which has ever not seen before. Hands down into the biggest PC game Capcom launched in 2018 so far.So be warned, if your computer can run this game, you might consider throwing away your real social life :3
Froggystyle	Recommended	53.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Froggystylexz95/	Fun as hell. Some connectivity issues going on whenever I try to matchmake, but joining specific games works fine.  Keyboard and mouse controls are quite good, too.
ksuD	Recommended	62.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/highdefinitionretard/	Don't let the reviews confuse you, the game is very good.It's the lackluster PC port that's causing the game to get review bombed. The game lacks a lot of things that any PC game should really have by now, especially considering they had six months to make the port.Wait a bit if you're skeptical, but if you're willing to buy and look past the issues, you'll be in for quite the experience.
Antiex	Not Recommended	42.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AntieX/	Thumbing this down until the servers actually work.
MaskedMouse	Recommended	125.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027662208/	Fun and addicting game. Recommended to play together with friends and do the story solo!Pros:- Feels like an adventure!- Fun to farm, doesn't feel like a chore- Moderate / good difficulty scaling, sometimes difficulty spikes- Feels like an achievement hunting the more difficult monsters successfully- Good intro / tutorial information- Fun to play with friends, advisable to play the storyline solo- Overall a good port, had no crashes whatsoever. No memory leaks.- Can be played casually and hardcore!Cons:- Settings require a little tweaking so that the FPS doesn't drop. Audio to surround sound and headset.Personal opinion Cons:- Somewhat limited character creation customization, a lot of options feel the same. Couldn't really find a face for the character that I liked.- Max 4 player co-op, sometimes we have 5 players meaning someone has to sit one out. Would've liked to see bigger maps for 5 or 6 players. But I can understand for performance and balance that 4 is a maximum.- Server issues at release, but they're working on a fix! It made me fail a hunt somewhere at the beginning of the game. Also occured just about starting an arena quest with friends, we got seperated from eachother at the start due to this issue. Had quite a difficult fight alone.- Rewards for investigation quests feel a bit off. 10k for an easy vespoid quest that takes 3 min, compared to a hunt quest that gives the same amount but takes a lot longer to complete, like 15~30 minutes. When the quest is done with multiple ppl it splits the money reward making the quest reward even less attractive. Some quests have low time and low reward whereas others have high time and high reward. Just feels off.- Constantly spams Steam Friends that they play the game, a bug that requires to be fixed soon.What I like about monster hunter world is that the farm required doesn't feel like a chore to do. It's actually fun to farm.It has moderate / good difficulty scaling, things feel like an achievement and not being all that easy to complete at times. Which is nice.It is sad to see ppl complaining about either Denuvo, FPS or Server issues.Denuvo doesn't kill performance of MHW, I don't even notice it is in there.FPS is fine as long as you tweak your settings, there are so many hardware configurations for PC that creating a setting that works for everyone is just difficult. I've set Volume Rendering Quality to variable, the overall suggestion is turning this off to increase performance. Yes the game is CPU intensive, got an i7 6700k @ 4.5 GHz overclocked to support it. Do I have FPS drops? pretty much none.Server issues are just starting issues, probably a too high load for the servers. They're working on a fix though, sure it sucks when it happens but it does not make the game not recommendable like a lot of people do. They're going to fix it.

So many quality of life changes were made to where I can finally enjoy this game. If you're like me and certain gameplay mechanics(I'm looking at you flex animation after drinking a potion) from the previous games were off putting to you, definitely give this one a try.

But on 2018, on a PC which has way more resources hardware and software wise, it crashes all the time. You are lucky if you play 1 mission and it doesnt disconnect.♥♥♥♥ing piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥On a side note, but not so much... what the ♥♥♥♥ is this crap about sessions anyway? Why do I have to create a session if I want to play solo? What's the ♥♥♥♥ing point of the session. F this sht.Good old days you would go into the guild and join somebody, everything worked just fine.As for the game itself...I appreciate those annoying craps were removed. Like needing to have stuff to catch bugs, mine minerals. But was it really necessary to dumb it down so much?

No, not at the moment.I can't even seem to join a Multiplayer session consistently, if at all, and the only fixes are ones that I have to slueth out on my own on the Internet, and they barely work.This is a AAA title, and God knows that they made a TON of money off the console release of the game, at least enough to fixnetwork issues that are clearly on thier end, not ours.

Mekner	Recommended	35.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mekner/	Despite a lot of the negative reviews I have seen for this game, I personally dont have much of a problem with it.The only real issue is that I have encountered is that the does not seem to be any way to re-bind controller buttons. Sure you can switch maybe two buttons, but compared to the options available for keyboard and mouse, it's rubbish.If i were to really nit-pick, and this is not really a technical issue, i would say its a shame that I don't really see too many people joining online sessions.

I am running it on 1080p 60 FPS Medium settings and the game looks great. The multiplayer does need to be fixed though because I keep getting Connection Has been lost but it is rare when that happen's.I'd say if you love Monster Hunter or are new to monster hunter then I'd say go for it.

Josith	Not Recommended	155.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118969670/	 If you're dominantly wanting to play with friends, take pause. Edit: CPU optimization would be great, what did ya'll do for half a year for the port?If you're wanting more realistically accessible co-op, go download Dauntless. I honestly laugh at the "its not monster hunter" fanboy comparison squads. It undisputably gets grouping up correct and 10x better than this AAA title where there's no excuse, as simple a concept as that should be by now. They've added a bunch of overly complicated and obsctructive♥♥♥♥♥♥in MHW that nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about, we just want a 4 player lobby to invite people to. And some scaling for 2,3 and 4 players, not just 1 or 4, wouldn't go amiss. ♥♥♥♥ing lazy Capcom.Ever known another game where you can't join someone's quest until they've seen a short cutscene? Me neither.Objectively a great game on the surface, and playing lone wolf, but the amount of obstacles and bureaucracy if your intent is to progress through things mostly with friends, is baffling for a current gen online game. The systems in place punish you for wanting to do this, on a game tagged "co-op", and which shoves vague "online sessions" and such in your face from early on into the game. It's more akin to Dark Souls where you'll just drop in and drop out as you see fit, call for help if you care to. Except getting extra players can grossly backfire on you here because, if someone is downed they take one of your 3 "Continues" the same as if you died yourself. Simply put, if any of you die a collective total of 3 times, it's quest failed. They're shared. If you're solo, same thing. 2 players is also the same enemy scaling as 4 players. This is a great system to cultivate hatred for noobs. Hate to say, again Dauntless has a far better system in place for deaths and co-op play.Unrelated fact : Borderlands 1 is 9 years old.Couple this up with, the moment you are more than 1 player, the monsters hit harder and have way more health, and don't seem to respond to your attacks as often as they would solo (such as a good smack in the head causing a stagger instead of the monster taking a chunk out of you). So in short,  deaths are far more likely with more players unless everyone is either a giant puss or ninja tier evasion.  And the monster turns into Jaws from james bond, in relation to how many ♥♥♥♥s it gives from being hit.So my experiences, as somebody who just beat Anjanath (the T-rex) a couple times, is that due to this poor balancing, it was easier to just "git gud" solo after a couple of failures, and get my gear in relative order, than open my game up online to get a squad. This is just a crying shame when I was under the impression teaming up and having folks bring different weapons etc was part of the appeal.So whilst I will continue to play at my own loner boy pace, I have to give a thumbs down in protest to the awful anti-consumer "partying up" system. There's just none of the stock excuses to hand, it's not early access, it's not a low budget indie title, it's not a cheap game, it's in fact 25% more than the average release price. If they had any testers on this who gave a ♥♥♥♥, this should've been pointed out during development.

Moonlightleaf	Recommended	47.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Moonlightleaf/	Despite a lot of negative reviews, Monster Hunter: World's latest patch seems to have fixed a lot of the previous issues. This game has proved to be a lot of fun to play with friends, and is easy enough to play for brief periods of time if you have a busy schedule. I highly suggest this game!
Grevoron	Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/grevoron/	I recommend this to those who do not complain way too much about the game's optimization. Clearly, playing on lowest settings still maintains a good graphical feel. Like the details are still there and the environment is beautiful. And I believe updates for performance issues will be posted. The game mechanics is good, no need to mention since it's been played from other consoles. Keybinding is not an issue for me but can be a little tricky to others, but console gamepad can be used for those who prefer them. I can't tell much about the online element as I prefer playing solo.For those familiar to MH games, this is by far the easiest. By mechanics, animations, info and stuff. There are autocraft and weapon/armor trees, guides and notifications, chat, etc. Although for me the UI and pretty much everything in the menu is confusing me.For those who are new, you don't need much info or knowledge from past MH as it stands on its own. Keep in mind that it will still require attention to details as it will be crucial to your walkthrough as you progress. Internet wikis and in game guides can e a huge help.All in all, I like it. The price is nothing much of a problem, but kinda seems like it could be a bit cheaper. Games are getting way too expensive.  But for me it's all fair, I guess. But for others, I sure hope they consider all kinds of reviews and gameplays before diving to the world of Hunters. Plus, aside from skin and animations/emotes stuff sold by the game, there's not much microtransaction. And it's not pay-to-win so you can enjoy the game like a pro or like a kid and still get the things others have. I've waited long to play this and now I have it, so you can be sure I'll enjoy this one. If you love to grind, this one's a good game to try.
Lokyst	Recommended	187.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lokyst/	Beautiful game with excellent telegraphing. As someone who is new to the genre, I could feel myself improving as I learned each of the enemies tells. Best of all, the fights felt fair and I did not feel like I was being punished for learning how to play.I played co-op with my partner through nearly the entire game. Experienced maybe one or two disconnects, but otherwise it's been smooth sailing.

bringdownthesky	Recommended	102.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004960220/	I have now beat this game on both Xbox One and PC and I do not regret it. This second playthrough was much more enjoyable with a fairly consistent (except for some of the elder dragon power/particle effects late in the game) 60-80 FPS @ 1080p with everyhting at max.
Faye'Li	Recommended	453.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042676242/	**October 2018 updateThe game is getting better with patches to fix the bugs and events to catch up to the console versions. You'll still find a lot of negative whiny reviews that make up BS until proven wrong or those who will simply make a negative review because maybe they didnt get one thing they felt entitled to. I suggest avoiding those for more realistic expectations.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You'll find plenty of reviews telling you what the game lacks and has issues with, so I'll try not to write a book on those. The game just released on PC so I'm realistic to believe there will be some issues with it, and the disconnection ones can get annoying at times, but I'm hopeful it will be resolved in time.+PhasingOne thing that does impress me is how the game phases to a single player experience should you do get disconnected. Instead of the game crashing like most other games, the other people disappear to you and your cat takes over. Not to praise it over the errors it has, but how seamless it keeps the game from ever just crashing because of them in my experience. Now if it only scaled down the creature when you end up fighting it alone. :3+GameplayShould you be lucky enough to not experience any real issues you'll find a game that will take over your social life, but the best part is you can take your friends with you. It's a mix of fast pace action, and casually collecting things you need, so a little patience helps in order to get all you need to be most effective. There ends up being a lot of things you can do back at the hub.+CombatI regret this is my first Monster Hunter experience, but I love fighting giant creatures I have no place picking a fight with and coming out successful. The controls took a little time to get used to since I use a controller and couldnt remap them, but wasn't a problem after a while. Each an every weapon has it's own unique playstyle so I'd recommend looking up any of the great guides on youtube to get the most out of them.+Other StuffThe game has a lot of little nuances to show you a lot went into it, like even just sitting in your room interacting with the pets you can collect. There's just a lot of little things to go into the most random stuff. I just feel too many people give reviews for the wrong reasons and not what reviews are actually about. If I couldnt get the game to play, I wouldn't review it till I actually could. That would be a more accurate impression imo. I think the worst kind of reviews are those that blame a game for the users own mistake, which I don't see too much here. But the ones blaming a game for not being a perfect port at launch are not realistic. There has never been a perfect launch or a perfect port right out the door. Expectations for that are too high. I'm amazed the game runs as well as it does.+Final ThoughtsThe game does have DC problems you will encounter, but if you can deal with them you'll find the game super fun. Just be patient and have realistic expectations to when stuff will be resolved. I mean for example, there's still people out there that are surprised when a Bethesda game has bugs. Most of us that have been around a while expect them and they've been making PC games forever. So who honestly expects a perfect port of the first PC Monster Hunter game without any issues? Now I'm not defending them for the stuff that doesnt work. If they don't fix them, by all means bust out your torches and pitchforks, but reasonable launch expectations are reasonable.
minh-le STS	Recommended	319.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/spacy1993/	Summary: A wonderful, good grinding gameplay loop with slight performance.Keyword: Semi open world, friendly coop, PvE, huge content, easy to enjoy hard to master.Having hate grindy online MMO for most of my life, Monster Hunter Worlds actually did it amazingly well. A wonderful gameplay loop that you can enjoy with friends and strangers alike.First off, the game has 14 different types of weapon, each would requires hours to master and gameplay are somewhat different from each other. Some weapon types are divided down into further sub set of smaller customizations, which will make the gameplay more complex, more contents. And much like hero shooter arena, there is weapon for different type of person. You can be a range weapon user that prioritize safe, slow approach. Risk and reward with heavy hitter that make you scream the for the whole sword swing animation, hoping the monster dont interrupt your glorious big sword. Or simply madness rushing enemies to land as much damamge as possible in short time. The game has complexity, grindy, yet only if you wish to do so. For example: You can eat food to buff yourself before a hunt start. You can simply choose any pre-set available dish. Or you can dive down into the whole picking the correct food combination, fresh ingredient, doing optional quest to unlock best ingredient to further powerup you character. Yet, the differences between those are mininal, like getting killed by monster in 2,5 vs 3 hit. - Grinding for optimal gear is a choice, luck base, yet you dont have to get the best stuff to mounting down monster. You can becomes a badass with single set of armor, an optimal hunter with mix set to hunt down specific kind of monster. Or just forget all those ♥♥♥♥♥ and state your own fashion with either cosmetic item (to be released in future) or pick any thing you feel pretty and at the same times making the game incredible difficult. And while you would hunt a specific monster for its loot to gain specific stuff, every hunt has slight variation: You can see your target fighting turf war with other monster, you can kill non-target monster for more loot per run, you can lure target into bait or environment trap. Each hunt also allow you to gain "track experience" through finding other monster, which then create optional quest for that specific one. The more you hunt, the easier it becomes to track down, understanding the weakness. The variety is even more engaging with multiplayers and combination of other 14 weapons. And by the time you hunt every monster there is to be, you still have 13 more weapons to try out and master.The fun greatly outweight the problem this game current have.---PC version issue: as correct as August 2018- (FIXED) Game getting slow down the more you play: It is specific by save game. Reset PC might help but issues still persist- Inconsistent performance across different kind of hardware- (STABLE NOW) Server down time randomly: When it works, it is perfect. When it has problem, you cant even create or join an online session.- No option to turn off depth of field, increase field of view.- Forced lower texture resolution bug, not happen to me personally but many other people have.- (FIXED) Prone to crash or disconnetion when alt+tab- No widescreen support- Some graphic option does not work- Low level of sound quality (Unless you use headphone)PC version highlight:+ Rebindable for mouse and keyboard control, especially item wheel (radial menu)+ Smooth transition between mouse and keyboard to insta controller. + Raw mouse input is available (Oct 2018)

danzdeeman	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972449024/	I am very disappointed with the porting of this game.  I was very excited about playing this title.  However, the mouse/keyboard controls were very clearly phoned in.  There is a very strange input lag/mouse acceleration issue with using a mouse in this game.  This seems to be ignored by most of the reviews external to steam that I read.  I tried following some online guides to edit the configuration files and edit the sensitivity profiles on my mouse.  I was able to get the camera aiming to be relatively smooth with these changes, but not a low enough sensitivity for my liking.  Clearly little effort was put into this port.  If you're interested in playing with  controller on PC you are good to go, but if you want to play with a mouse and keyboard I strongly advise you to avoid this game for now.

Cynthimon™	Recommended	173.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cynthimon/	Having tried Monster Hunter in the past on handheld platforms, I couldn't quite get into them due to the graphics quality and rather frustrating controls. With Monster Hunter World, the graphics are amazing and the controls feel much better (though not perfect), so this is the first Monster Hunter game that I managed to finish the story and still keep on playing more.Pros:- Amazing graphics- Improved Monster Hunter gameplay formula, almost everything feels better than previous titles- Multiplayer, very fun playing with a group of friends- Mouse and keyboard support for the first timeCons:- Networking and disconnecting Issues (recently fixed for me, but was game breaking when it happened often)- Graphics and controls could be more optimised (hard to get 60 fps, controls and UI are still very console-like for the PC version)- Minor annoyance during co-op is the main story hunts: everyone needs to individually watch the story cutscenes first before being able to join up and play together- Story wasn't very interesting, but don't think anyone plays Monster Hunter for the storyNot perfect, but imo the best Monster Hunter experience so far.

The thrill of the hunts, the lure of progression, the beauty of the scenery, the dismay of failure. I was reminded of the good old times when I heard MHW is coming to steam. ARE U ***KING KIDDING ME?! I was never a 'console' person, and that naturally had me anticipating.I was playing solo exclusively when the game was released on steam (I had no idea the game was having connection issues), the game is stellar across the board, graphics is excellent, the music is pleasing, Coral Highlands look so enchanting, exactly what a Monster Hunter sequel should be. It was until approximately two weeks ago from the time of this review that I wanted to try the multiplayer aspect.I was disappointed by how much the multiplayer aspect failed, of this otherwise perfect game. I only managed to connect to an online session briefly ONCE, even though it was two to three weeks after release. The developers released a patch (on 23rd Aug, I believe) which supposedly should resolve the bulk of the connection issue, yet the problem persisted over at my end. It felt like capcom does not care if the game is broken. It felt like the connection issue was never gonna be resolved. It also felt like maybe the whole world is enjoying multiplayer, except where I am from.LO AND BEHOLD. I was so terribly wrong. From approximately 4 to 5 days ago, I can consistently connect to an online session, post quests with players joining me, join quests, respond to SOS flares, send SOS flares AND receive help from other players. Apparently the developers are working consistently to correct the connection issue. I believe this game can finally redeemed itself and meet the expectations of the whole fanbase.

Rams	Recommended	160.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RamsterHamster/	This really doesn't deserve "mixed reviews" anymore. It was at launch, but the came's got a long way since, in that short span of time. It really is the best game of 2018 for me. Once you learn the MANY mechanics (many hop off here, but stick with the game, try to understand), you'll appreciate the depth of the game and every neat little trick to your weapon of choice. The weapon types in this game are basically classes.There is so much to this game, and just because it says "mixed" because of some people not being able to connect, then proceed to abandon the game. It's ridiculous, and I urge every single one who's reading this to give it a go.

Evening Star ✶	Recommended	250.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EveningStars/	While it is a good game i can't recommend it in it's current state if you're looking for lot of online hunting with random people due connection issues. Aside from the varius Online issues that currently plauges the game it's a solid entry in the MH series. That being said if you don't mind playing solo or have friends playing it's still tons of fun, but if you're unsure then wait to buy it until the issues have been resolved.
DirtyRandy	Recommended	62.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045317340/	this is such a great game. so addictive. the bad reviews on here are only people complaining because they didn't know it was a console port, people with garbage hardware, and people with multiplayer connection issues, which from what i understand have since been patched. i have had no problems with multiplayer and disconnecting from friends since the patch.  Everything works great!
Matsu	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/whitesuitgaming/	**Let me say now, that even if the multiplayer function is not stable at the moment, I've no doubt it will be resolved in time as it was on the consoles. I do find it a bit silly to not recommend this game just because multiplayer doesn't work sometimes, especially when my own experience has yet to be marred by that issue. (I have no problem connecting online, even when using college campus internet connection!) Anywho, even if you play this game solo, you will not regret exploring the world of this Monster Hunter. Let us begin:The Thrill of the Hunt: As an avid Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter 2 Freedom Unite, all the way up to World, plus nearly 300+ hours into World, there was little doubt I would enjoy Monster Hunter World. However, I am vastly impressed with how fluid and more smooth gameplay has become, making it far more welcoming to hunters new to the franchise. The older games had plenty of emphasis on weight, movement, and taking into account how long each action takes (using a potion, setting a trap, etc), but MHW still succeeds in utilizing those things and turning combat into a fluid dance with forces of nature. For comparison, using a potion on an older MH game involved involuntary flexing (Still unsure why), whereas MHW allows you to move while using the potion. You can even dodge to stop healing midway even, incase you need to! Now there's the introduction of the Slinger, allowing hunters to fire items and tools quickly from an arm-mounted crossbow. It also comes with a grappeling hook! The pacing is not as slow as previous games I have played, but I feel it is just right for the next Generation to explore this World. Each of the 14 different weapon types has been revamped for this game, each offering it's own sense of fluidity, weight, and destruction. But I feel gunners are the most blessed bunch, now having the ability to fire while moving. Makes a massive difference! As well as the armor between gunners and blademasters now shared! This is the most streamlined Monster Hunter game, in my opinion, but it still offers the challenge of learning each monster's dance and weakness, and at the same time learning to perfect your own dance with your weapon and tools. This is the game to begin on.Graphics/Computer-y Stuff: Me, having little knowledge of GPUs and computers, just let MHW default the graphics option and I have no complaints. However, I have noted being able to start the game much quicker on my laptop than on the PS4, which is a great plus. The world itself is just beautiful, or maybe too beautiful... It's easy to get lost exploring until a Rathalos or Deviljho decides to remind you where we are on the food chain. Excellent work by Capcom also making each map now 1 large persistent zone, as opposed to previous entries offering large maps broken up by loading screens. The zones feel so alive with each having different endemic life and large monsters coming and going as the day goes on during expeditions. They've succeeded in making this world feel so alive. Other stuff: I just also want to stress why I love this game so much; that though there will always be stronger equipment to get, there's no set absolute end-all be-all set of equipment. Everyone has different playstyles, and the best set to use is the one you are most familiar and most proficient with using. And learning is something we humans do every day. I highly encourage experimenting with different weapons in the training area in Astera, you may never know until you try!**Even More Things: I have to say, after reading through some reviews that simply don't adequately justify their "Not recommended" status of this game, I believe after patches the game at the least deserves to be positive. The team behind MHW is actively working to make the PC port just as good as its console counterpart. That and some nitpicks certainly are just that: nitpicks! The lack of a G-Rank doesn't make MHW any less a worthy Monster Hunter game; the arch-tempered monsters that came onto the consoles felt like pseudo-G-Rank-ish fights, even! I think the most interesting complaint was the scoutflies being a nuisance, but I thought they were a very good addition for new and veteran hunters. Not only can they point out gathering points for the green hunter, they are WAY more convenient to use for tracking down monsters in these huge maps, as opposed to ye olden ways of paintballs and happening across the wrong large monster. Monster Hunter World does have flaws, don't get me wrong, but they aren't enough to detract from the experience it has given me. Also, don't forget there are free content updates to this game! I feel spoiled after having been given so much to do on the PS4, and I'm not even done. However, I've always dreamed of having a game like this on the go. Don't let a temporary problem knock your decision. This game is worth it. It has a whole World of quality, and more to offer in the near future.

Having played most every other game in the franchise Monster Hunter World is really welcoming for both the veteran hunter and rookie alike. My MAIN gripe with this game upon release was the connection issues and having what I beleive unnecessary gatekeeping (having to watch the cutscenes in a quest to play multiplayer), but now since most of my friends have completed the story and connection issues seem to be all but gone. 10/10 for the current state of the game and enjoyment I've derived seeing my buddies get haymakered by Nerg.

It's a good start so far.I've completed the achievements, and it's still fun to play with friends. Connectivity issues were fixed in a few weeks after the launch, the only problem I'm having is FPS drops which I hope they keep improving in the next patches. Overall it's fun, immersive, and playable both solo and multiplayer.The game is challenging and brings back a lot of good memories if you've played the previous Monster Hunter versions. And having to play with a keyboard and mouse is actually not bad.It doesn't matter whether you play solo or with friends, you will gain friends which is really nice in MH games. The game has only been up for a month and a half and the content we get  from time to time is really progressive.

NexAngelus *X*	Recommended	266.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xblade7703/	great game, and CONNECTION aka group issues are gone now! u no longer need to oldsteam it up.if u like hunting animals/monsters down, like sniffing animal/monster tracks, like picking up dung, fighting ferocious huge monsters, like carving ur new armor/weapons out of their skin..... join the ranks of the hunters guild! if u dont like monster hunter yet, then u just have not come to ur weapon yet! main story is around 100hours, depending on alot of variables of course, but its beefy.
Medi	Recommended	33.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053337262/	Pros:- Lot of diversity to gameplay and how you want to customize your character.- You can go on a dedicated mission or you can simply roam around in an area.- I personally haven't had any issues with connectivity (thus far).- There's a good amount of character progression.- Each monster has unique weakpoints and general weaknesses so it benefits you to do some homework.Cons: - Harder missions almost require that you rely on friends or other players online. - The lip-syncing is on par with the early "Godzilla" movies that were dubbed to English.- Some materials are very hard to obtain and it can take you a few hours of farming just to make a piece of gear you want.- The overall story relies on you knowing a bit about the Monster Hunter world and drawing a lot of conclusions as well. In this way, the story asks a lot of questions and answers very few of them.- If you don't like gathering items, this game may bug you a bit.Overall, I am actually very satisified with the game. There is a sense of pride and achievement in beating each monster and progressively becoming better. The armor and weaponry in this game is diverse and the game doesn't punish you for experimenting. Even if you're use to a weapon, as it upgrades there are potential changes that it can/will go through that may require you to adjust your entire playstyle to compensate for this. While this might sound like a bad thing, the changes are usually small enough not to be a completely new endevor to master the weapon but significant enough that you have to strive to be proficeint in the weapon.

I only managed to connect to an online session briefly ONCE, even though it was two to three weeks after release. The developers released a patch (on 23rd Aug, I believe) which supposedly should resolve the bulk of the connection issue, yet the problem persisted over at my end. It felt like capcom does not care if the game is broken. It felt like the connection issue was never gonna be resolved. It also felt like maybe the whole world is enjoying multiplayer, except where I am from.LO AND BEHOLD. I was so terribly wrong. From approximately 4 to 5 days ago, I can consistently connect to an online session, post quests with players joining me, join quests, respond to SOS flares, send SOS flares AND receive help from other players. Apparently the developers are working consistently to correct the connection issue. I believe this game can finally redeemed itself and meet the expectations of the whole fanbase.

Jofeder	Recommended	75.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010617972/	Monster Hunter World is generous, gorgeous and fun, give it a try !
Rams	Recommended	160.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RamsterHamster/	This really doesn't deserve "mixed reviews" anymore. It was at launch, but the came's got a long way since, in that short span of time. It really is the best game of 2018 for me. Once you learn the MANY mechanics (many hop off here, but stick with the game, try to understand), you'll appreciate the depth of the game and every neat little trick to your weapon of choice. The weapon types in this game are basically classes.There is so much to this game, and just because it says "mixed" because of some people not being able to connect, then proceed to abandon the game. It's ridiculous, and I urge every single one who's reading this to give it a go.
S H I V A	Recommended	53.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OneWinged_Angel/	Sweet game.Fun multiplayer, beautifully designed world, interesting and unique monsters and a really in depth weapon and armor system which makes every build and weapon class feel super unique.It's fun both solo and with friends, and knowing that there are more Free Title Updates with more Monsters and Events coming soon makes me really excited to play more.There were a few Multiplayer issues on launch, but since those have been fixed the game has been pretty flawless.

Evening Star ✶	Recommended	250.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EveningStars/	While it is a good game i can't recommend it in it's current state if you're looking for lot of online hunting with random people due connection issues. Aside from the varius Online issues that currently plauges the game it's a solid entry in the MH series. That being said if you don't mind playing solo or have friends playing it's still tons of fun, but if you're unsure then wait to buy it until the issues have been resolved.
DirtyRandy	Recommended	62.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045317340/	this is such a great game. so addictive. the bad reviews on here are only people complaining because they didn't know it was a console port, people with garbage hardware, and people with multiplayer connection issues, which from what i understand have since been patched. i have had no problems with multiplayer and disconnecting from friends since the patch.  Everything works great!
Matsu	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/whitesuitgaming/	**Let me say now, that even if the multiplayer function is not stable at the moment, I've no doubt it will be resolved in time as it was on the consoles. I do find it a bit silly to not recommend this game just because multiplayer doesn't work sometimes, especially when my own experience has yet to be marred by that issue. (I have no problem connecting online, even when using college campus internet connection!) Anywho, even if you play this game solo, you will not regret exploring the world of this Monster Hunter. Let us begin:The Thrill of the Hunt: As an avid Monster Hunter since Monster Hunter 2 Freedom Unite, all the way up to World, plus nearly 300+ hours into World, there was little doubt I would enjoy Monster Hunter World. However, I am vastly impressed with how fluid and more smooth gameplay has become, making it far more welcoming to hunters new to the franchise. The older games had plenty of emphasis on weight, movement, and taking into account how long each action takes (using a potion, setting a trap, etc), but MHW still succeeds in utilizing those things and turning combat into a fluid dance with forces of nature. For comparison, using a potion on an older MH game involved involuntary flexing (Still unsure why), whereas MHW allows you to move while using the potion. You can even dodge to stop healing midway even, incase you need to! Now there's the introduction of the Slinger, allowing hunters to fire items and tools quickly from an arm-mounted crossbow. It also comes with a grappeling hook! The pacing is not as slow as previous games I have played, but I feel it is just right for the next Generation to explore this World. Each of the 14 different weapon types has been revamped for this game, each offering it's own sense of fluidity, weight, and destruction. But I feel gunners are the most blessed bunch, now having the ability to fire while moving. Makes a massive difference! As well as the armor between gunners and blademasters now shared! This is the most streamlined Monster Hunter game, in my opinion, but it still offers the challenge of learning each monster's dance and weakness, and at the same time learning to perfect your own dance with your weapon and tools. This is the game to begin on.Graphics/Computer-y Stuff: Me, having little knowledge of GPUs and computers, just let MHW default the graphics option and I have no complaints. However, I have noted being able to start the game much quicker on my laptop than on the PS4, which is a great plus. The world itself is just beautiful, or maybe too beautiful... It's easy to get lost exploring until a Rathalos or Deviljho decides to remind you where we are on the food chain. Excellent work by Capcom also making each map now 1 large persistent zone, as opposed to previous entries offering large maps broken up by loading screens. The zones feel so alive with each having different endemic life and large monsters coming and going as the day goes on during expeditions. They've succeeded in making this world feel so alive. Other stuff: I just also want to stress why I love this game so much; that though there will always be stronger equipment to get, there's no set absolute end-all be-all set of equipment. Everyone has different playstyles, and the best set to use is the one you are most familiar and most proficient with using. And learning is something we humans do every day. I highly encourage experimenting with different weapons in the training area in Astera, you may never know until you try!**Even More Things: I have to say, after reading through some reviews that simply don't adequately justify their "Not recommended" status of this game, I believe after patches the game at the least deserves to be positive. The team behind MHW is actively working to make the PC port just as good as its console counterpart. That and some nitpicks certainly are just that: nitpicks! The lack of a G-Rank doesn't make MHW any less a worthy Monster Hunter game; the arch-tempered monsters that came onto the consoles felt like pseudo-G-Rank-ish fights, even! I think the most interesting complaint was the scoutflies being a nuisance, but I thought they were a very good addition for new and veteran hunters. Not only can they point out gathering points for the green hunter, they are WAY more convenient to use for tracking down monsters in these huge maps, as opposed to ye olden ways of paintballs and happening across the wrong large monster. Monster Hunter World does have flaws, don't get me wrong, but they aren't enough to detract from the experience it has given me. Also, don't forget there are free content updates to this game! I feel spoiled after having been given so much to do on the PS4, and I'm not even done. However, I've always dreamed of having a game like this on the go. Don't let a temporary problem knock your decision. This game is worth it. It has a whole World of quality, and more to offer in the near future.
dentorium	Recommended	263.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dentorium/	amazing game if you love deep combat, farming items for  crafting and lots of big bosses.
Whompp	Recommended	187.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079490998/	Great segway of a franchise from the japanese market. They really captivated the nostalgia of the original Monster Hunter that debuted on the PS2. Having played most every other game in the franchise Monster Hunter World is really welcoming for both the veteran hunter and rookie alike. My MAIN gripe with this game upon release was the connection issues and having what I beleive unnecessary gatekeeping (having to watch the cutscenes in a quest to play multiplayer), but now since most of my friends have completed the story and connection issues seem to be all but gone. 10/10 for the current state of the game and enjoyment I've derived seeing my buddies get haymakered by Nerg.
Natertots	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/natertots1011/	It's monster hunter, on steam, what's not to like?
Kung Fu Kenny	Recommended	56.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071218133/	This game as any Monster Hunter game will do; is a time sink which you will enjoy. The grind doesn't feel reptitvie and boring unlike *COUGH* Destiny *COUGH. The game isn't perfect as there are issues like the complete absence of any sort of lip sync of characters with their audio respectively and the game can be quite overwhemly with the tutorials and potential stuff you can do, so this might put off some new comers such as me, however if you look past this you can easily see yourself playing over 100+ hours in this game which is well worth the money.Now about the multiplayer, it isn't as easy to play the inital story mode with your mates as  you both have to watch the cutscences seperately which is kind of annoying and you cant see other hunters in the hub area apart in the gathering which is a small section of the hub.The PC port is really poor and consume alot of pc resources to not even match the XBOX ONE X visually. Hopefully Capcom can patch this mess.Pushing past these small faults I can wholeheartedly recommend this without any doubt.
Dr. Gurke	Not Recommended	199.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033391703/	Probably should not buy this unless you have a lot of experience with Monster Hunter games or friends who do.

Or else expect more red reviews.UPDATEconnection issues is not a really big deal now, yet other problem still exist, lag spikes, especially againts Teostra, and the fact that there are hundreds of thousands ppl playing this game BUT I CANT ♥♥♥♥ING FIND A VAAL HAZAK PARTY FROM SOS FFS.still cant give thumbs up, the game is going to the right direction tho.

Insecuro	Not Recommended	204.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Z4wn/	I can look past all the graphical issues (other than 10 fps with more than one gunner in a fight, very annoying) because I'm a pretty forgiving person, but one of my favorite things from previous monster hunter games was enjoying the camaraderie of doing round-robin quests in a guild-hall, I don't know if it's the PC community or the game's mechanics itself but almost nobody plays WITH anyone anymore unless they're close friends they know. People just use SOS flares to attract random people to help you for 10 minutes then never speak to them again. I have no friends who play this game, and in my experience every single person I've tried to enguage in conversation has either ignored me or answers matter-of-factly and doesn't continue the small talk. It just leaves me feeling like I'm playing an MMO with a bunch of faceless rare farmers.I'd like to blame Capcom's servers, but even when I do connect to a lobby with 12-15 people connected, nobody even tries to show up at the gathering hall. this, coupled with the myriad of graphical/server issues leaves a pretty bad taste in my mouth.IF you have people you know who you can talk to to play this game with, I wholeheartedly recommend it.if you're gonna be solo-playing, expecting randoms to enguage you in conversation or communication of any kind OTHER than throwing you in the air with their switch-axe/hammer, I think you're gonna be pretty disappointed like I was.
Caramel Frappe	Recommended	113.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CaramelFrappe/	Caramel Frappe's Review on Monster Hunter: WorldLike most people, I haven't played Monster Hunter before. I've heard about the previous installment being good, but I couldn't be bothered to play it. Then Monster Hunter: World came out for the PC / consoles, and because I owned a PC, I figured why not try it? So after giving it a good 40+ hours and getting far into the game, I can safely say .... It's a bloody good experience and incredibly fun.There's a lot to tackle in this review, so i'll try to narrow everything down to the best of my abilities.How are the Weapons / Armor?This game offers a lot, and I mean a LOT of variety when it comes to your weapons and armor. To start things off, the game allows you to pick 14 different weapons off the bat, each with their own trees. Like, it's one thing to have so many unique weapons, but each weapon having multiple trees based on the monsters you've harvested? Now that's awesome. There are so, so, so many different looking weapons and armors depending on the monsters you've hunted down and the materials you have collected. As the game goes on, you unlock an altnerative look to armors so now you have 2 choices or more among the monsters you've slain. Each weapon path causes it to change form, and the more you dive into that path, the more your weapon begins to change appearance. I can't even explain how many choices you have, it's enourmous.How is the Combat / Mechanics of the Game?The world map is quite big, and each area can take you awhile to fully explore. Even then, there's other beasts and monsters roaming about, not just your target. Hunting down a monster can go on for a bit, tracking down it's footprints, gathering it's scales / feathers / ect. and finding out where it lives. Once you find it, all bets are off when the fight happens. It can go smooth or chaotic at any moment, and other monsters can intrude on your fight what's called a "turf war". Really fun to watch, and rather exciting. You can do multiple combos with your weapon to either weaken the monster, break apart it's armor plating, cut it's tail off, assist your allies by slowing it down, tank the hits with your shield- the capablitlies you're offered is again, impressive. So much thought was put into how to take down these monsters, hell they give you over 99 items to use, all with a useful purpose in helping you take these baddies down. Oh and you don't have to always kill them, capturing them can not only help you understand their weaknesses, but you gain more loot as a result.How are the Monsters though?I'm happy to say, there's a lot of them. Each unique, stands out, and will definitely take time fighting. Even though some monsters look 'identical', they will have different animations or have abilities that are different from their counter part. You can read up on how they behave, see how they interact with the world around them, even watch some monsters eating other monsters. The beauty of this game is, you really feel like you're hunting a beast, not a demonic force that's over the top. It's just an animal that's wild, and you're putting your skills as a Hunter to the test. I love the way each enemy has a particular weakness and how they act when on the verge of death (they limp away, cry, try to fly away or do things that feels immersive). Gotta hand it, there's way more monsters than I imagined there to be, and it made me satisfied.What about the Cons of the Game?A few big issues revolve mostly around online co-op. Day 1 was really bad, people dropping from servers constantly while during mid fight, people would disconnect. While patches have made the game's servers more stable, I sometimes run into this problem. Another issue that irritates me, is that you must see particular cut scenes to co-op with people. You can't just start a mission, you must activate a cutscene before you join / play with someone. Only people who have seen it all can join anyone's server, but if you haven't seen a particular cut scene, you can't have co-op until you've seen it. Then there's the fact you have zero reason to make another character. Because you have access to all the weapons / paths / armors / ect, you have no reason to try making another character and because you CAN'T skip cutscenes, it would be a huge pain to watch them all over again. So it's best to stick with one character. Another problem is certain bosses can one shot you, even if you're blocking or dodging. The hit boxes aren't always great so you will find yourself getting ripped off at times. The difficult curve can spike depending on the bosse's combos and how well equipped you are.What's your Conclusion?My review is pretty vague and I didn't get to cover everything I wanted. But, there's so much to do in this game. Gathering materials, helping your base research species to improve your armor / gear, seeing how beautiful the world is, astounishing fights and epic fights all about, even the grinding is fun because you're hunting down Monsters without the game ever feeling dull. I haven't gotten bored or tired once, so that's something. Character creation is alright, and the lip syncing is meh since it's a Japanese game translated / subbed into English, but if you can look past that- it's no big deal. Monster Hunter: World has a lot going for it, and I love this game. I will continue playing it because each bounty / mission gives you a lot to do, and co-op just makes it all the more alive. Game is a solid 8.5 / 10 for me, 8 sometimes when the game's server gives me a hard time. But it's worth buying.

Does Bruno Mars Is Gay?	Not Recommended	29.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088727459/	Why the hell is it impossible to turn off motion blur? And what is with the mouse controls? I know from reading other reviews there are some other settings that are impossible to change. Why did it take so long to realease this game on pc if they failed to implement these BASIC things. Until it's fixed I'm not recommending this game.EDIT:Now fullscreen has stopped working. Game has fullscreen enabled but it's always windowed. I've tried alt+enter but it doesn't work.EDIT 2:So for some reason it goes fullscreen when switching to borderless fullscreen and if I switch back to fullscreen it becomes windowed again. Oh and if you want to play online with friends or randoms... Ehm, good luck to you

It's a really fun game if a rough and badly done port but the gameplay is fun enough I would forgive that... but the broken state of multiplayer (a large reason I got the game, to smash monsters on the head with a hammer with my friends) is the straw that broke the camel's back. I'll change the review to positive if/when the server stability issues are fixed.

VirtualViper1	Not Recommended	84.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VirtualViper1/	Great game and a refreshing take on a legendary franchise. However, the constant disconnects and Capcom's anti-consumer practices (namely the implementation of Denuvo's DRM) force me to leave a negative review.
cheshire.panther	Recommended	153.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodrizer/	OK, was seriously busy playing the game, but it's time to offset this surge of negative reviews from whiny ♥♥♥♥♥uckers.This is nerly perfect PC port, hands down the best series in the universe and one of the best if not the best game in the series. I had somewhere around 1000+ play hours of 2G/3G combined and I dont regret every one of them. It's impossible to explain what makes MH so good - the thrill, the insane difficulty curve, the fact that you have to actually learn how your weapons and enemies work rather than grind levels - but at some point it just clicks and you can never go back.

Juggernaut	Recommended	161.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000575393/	I hardly ever review games on steam, but this one getting "mixed" reviews seems wrong. Absolutely one of the best "AAA" games to come out all year (or last year, or the year before that...). A lot of the negative reviews seem to be focused on the network problems during the first two-three weeks after launch, which are mostly fixed by now. To me it seemed like a minor issue anyway, since I always got my connectivity issues resolved within around 10 minutes (though maybe I'm an outlier) by just trying to reconnect a few times, never mind the fact that this game is thoroughly enjoyable as a single player experience as well, if you're into single player games (which I am).I'll leave this review short, and just urge you to try if you're into RPGs, ARPGs, CRPGs, JRPGs, fighting games or any other good games. A quality product, through and through. 92/100, if you like points.
#TDG Hololand3	Not Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hololand/	Nice concept, Nice ideas and I love the core principles behind this game. However the state that this game is in makes it far from worth the £50 price tag associated with it. Let me list a few of the initial things that have really annoyed me with this game.Pros - - Great concept with fresh idea's and something I really want to try out- Good amount of content and continued updates and support- Cool features and I like the Palico'sCons - -(YOU CAN'T EVEN DISSABLE MOTION BLUR OR THE CUSTARDY MOUSE SMOOTHING WITH CONSOLE AUOTAIM ENABLED BY DEFAULT ON PCCCC?- Unintuitive and horribly clunky controls (and this is coming from an avid Arma player)- Akward and broken networking and matchmaking. (for the price tag this game boasts it should have consistend solid multiplayer and the social hub should at least be expanded to the whole of Astera.) - Dodgy quest recognition in multiplayer (I had to repeat a quest TWICE because it never recognized the first completion of it as I did it with friends???!!?)- Invisible walls literally everywhere and generaly a restrictive environment (Purely to make up for a lack of good world design)- A one hour long tutorial that rips the camera from your hand every 30 seconds to point it at something you don't necessarily want to look at).- Bad performance considering the mediocre graphics the game provides.- Some classes are so badly ported that 50% of your actions cannot be cancelled and result in you just watching as your character gets slapped about and killed.- To give an example of how convoluted this game can be. If you want to play a quest with a friend. You must first join their server which may fail a few times, You must then do the quest yourself just untill you finish all the cutscenes. After that you must abandon your quest and join theirs after they have watched all the cutscenes (this make may fail to connect a few times too), After that you both ready up and hope for the best.TL:DR - This game has some good ideas and would be amazing if it were a £20 game. But for a £50 game it is clunky, unfinished, uses outdated mechanics like invisible walls, has horrible networking and matchmaking, has poor performance for a mediocre looking game, and is ported poorly.
♥Ashley♥	Not Recommended	56.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/	Maybe it gets better later? Just right now i'm extremely unimpressed. With a few friends who had been endlessly hyping this game to me i'm left sorely disappointed for a number of reasons.So far, combat just feels so insanely dull. Sure unique enemies but in the end so far they all play the same. You hit the legs and belly until it roars then you roll away. Then when you hit its back, you roll when it swings it tail, repeat on every monster i've met so far. The worst is just the awful controls.One aspect of the controls drives me insane due to just how it's missing. It seems absolutely insane to me and i doubt i'll get used to it anytime soon. When you start attacking you have no ability to turn your character at all. As a result when a dinosaur slightly moves left or right, your character will be left swinging their weapon like crazy and missing every attack. The insanely unresponsive controls make this so much worse. A monster moves an inch to the side and you have to wait through slow animations and then long pauses of not responsive controls before you can even turn to face them again. By this time you've either been attacked or it's moved once again.A mixture of unresponsive controls that take forever to respond after a single attack. Depending on the weapon, you're usually idle for a full second after an attack before any other form of keys will register. That and a constant battle with a confused camera which gets the game confused with your ability to dodge. Numerous times i find myself holding left and pressing roll, only for my character to roll directly forwards into an incoming attack.Meanwhile the game will give you an insanely long tutorial of how to use a menu. Other times it simply won't tell you how to do anything at all. There are aspects that can feel extremely complicated to a new player that are completely lacking a tutorial, leaving you absolutely confused of how to do it.It's not an awful game... it looks nice and has a cool idea. It's just feeling so extremely basic for me right now. Bad controls, camera and tutorials are just making it a very dull experience for me. I'm going to keep playing it occasionally but i'm really unimpressed so far.Edit: Little sad that i have to point this out but regardless. My review is MY opinion, the game contains things i do not like. If you like the things i do not like, that is perfectly fine. Liking the things you like, does not mean mine or your opinion are factually correct, it's an opinion. You're welcome to write your own positive review if you feel that way. The game just has so much stuff i don't enjoy.

Spanky	Not Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079350683/	A decent game, miserable port and playing with friends is next to impossible. It's such a chore to try and play this game with friends that it's not even worth the trouble. Requiring players to have seen the same cutscenes, even requiring them to see the cutscenes from the quest they're attempting to begin together is a dumb way to lock out friends from joining one another. This game is a slog to play alone, grinding for materials to gain marginal upgrades to face monsters that are impossible to kill solo. Definitely recommend against this game prior to any major fixes from Capcom.
Fairy	Not Recommended	247.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116692598/	Bought this game to play with friends but have received nothing but constant errors. I have no interest in solo play yet I'm constantly forced to fight much stronger than normal monsters completely solo because of all the connection issues. I was all for giving them time to fix it but it's been almost 2 weeks since release and NOTHING has changed. I do not reccomend this game at all unless you enjoy being frustrated and angry.
JoesGetNDown	Recommended	206.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JoesGetNDown/	Great fun killing and crafting. Even though it's my first Monster Hunter, it did a decent job easing me in, and now I'm a fan, and will be picking up future titles, no doubt.

adrianor31	Not Recommended	160.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adrianor/	8/18/2018. Don't buy this game until they fix the disconnect issues with the servers. It's an online game and you probably need help or wanna play the game with friends and other people, but if the server disconnected you, forget it. Every single time you get disconnected from the online session, no matter if you created the online session or you join another session. The solution from the devs are "open these ports", but with those ports opened you get disconnected too.

PinkKatana	Not Recommended	146.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086046139/	Good game but ♥♥♥♥ing trash servers. Negative review till disconnections are fixed.
milamber45	Not Recommended	163.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051442557/	TL;DR : Good game, very lazy port.I can't recommand this game now, at this price, at least not until it get fixed.The game itself is good, as shown by the many hours I have on it, but I should have waited until the price got lower, or the bugs fixed, to buy it.The pros: -(Mostly) Good gameplay : Tough monsters, many fighting styles, varied environments-Visuals : at least partially, the monsters look great imo. Some environments do as well. Characters look decent, but facial animations aren't always the best.-Crafting : Lots and lots of crafting-Like... a ton of crafting-And loot-The game's system is cyclical and addicting : prep for a hunt, do the hunt, collect the rewards, craft from the results of the hunt, then repeat.The Big deal-breaking cons :-Connectivity issues : Multiplayer is in shambles, it keeps disconnecting. The Matchmaking option simply never worked, at least for me. Searching and getting into a server is actually possible, but I'll get a disconnect 30 to 60 minutes later. This is for many people the issue #1-Texture bug : Certain items' textures look awful for no reason, no matter which texture resolution you pick. From what i've seen, i'm not the only one, and the issue affects the same arbitrary items across different players.The two aforementioned issues are my biggest gripes. For an AAA title, at an AAA price, and with SIX MONTHS to prepare for the PC release, those issues are too much. I still like the game, but if I had known about those issues, I wouldn't have bought it so soon, at that price.If both are fixed I'll definietly change my review to positive.Other lesser cons :-Optimization and graphic options : There's no way to change bloom and motion blur. Also, no official support for ultrawide resolutions. No FOV option too obviously.-No actual mouse support : There's no direct input for mouse controls. It means that the mouse is basically an emulated joystick, with a deadzone and a max speed. It's really awkward to use when you're used to using a mouse in most other pc games. It's a lesser con for me, since I use a controller for console ports, but quite a big one for KB+M users.-The story, which is passable at best. Honestly, I didn't go into this game expecting a good story. It's literally a game about hunting monsters, as said on the box. So, I wouldn't mind at all if there wasn't one, if the NPCs were silent quest givers. But no, the "story" and its bland characters are shoved down your throat through  unskippable  cutscenes. It's basically impossible to ignore. I'm not even harsh, the characters evolve through the plot without clear motives or driving force or character development, etc. It's just so... cliche, as in, eye-roll inducing cliche. As far as plot goes, if they gave me either nothing, or something good, I would have been fine with it.The neither good nor bad : I'm fine with how the game looks for how it runs on my PC. With a GTX 1060 3Gb, I can optimize my setting from mid to high to get 55-60 fps most of the time, with some drops to 40ish during certain fights. The game looks better in motion than in screenshots, when everything moves, the dust, the grass, the water. But it still take a lot to make it run ok, for a visual result that I would call decent, not amazing.-The game is very grindy as certain points. I was expecting that, considering the nature of the game. But I still find myself annoyed by how long it takes to find some rare materials, despite farming the right monster parts.Thanks for reading.
Uncle Skeeter	Not Recommended	42.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KushDyr/	A communication error occurred. Error code: 83-mw1 apparently they dont want you to play with friends considering you will get this message when it disconnects you every 10min
MKUltraJesus	Not Recommended	372.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039889451/	I like it, I really do, looks great, gameplay loop is fabulous, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥those issues are some issues. bad optimisation, server dropout, mouse and keyboard problems, controller support is terrible (the official steam controller config from capcom actually disables the controller) no 21:9 support, story co-op is basically ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, as well as missing PC optimisation options such as DoF or mouse acceleration.Anyway as soon as these issues are fixed, i will gladly give this a thumbs up, but spending $60USD on a half baked PC port that took 6 months is a joke.
cupnoodle	Not Recommended	87.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cupnoodle14/	The PC port is fantastic- Can't play multiplayer with friends who haven't seen certain cutscenes WTF- Can't remove mouse acceleration- UI and game controls don't really work well with mouse and keyboard- No options to turn off DoF, bloom and motion blur.- No FOV slider- A lot of textures are really low resolution.- Archaic multiplayer system and menus.- Some disconnection errors

Zaeroso	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zaeroso/	Overall rating: 8.5/10Reasons for all the thumbs down are:1. Ultrawide is NOT supported (I was really annoyed with this)2. People are crashing on loading up the game (I never experienced this with my i7-8700k & GTX 1080ti)3. The Xbox One controller isn't fully supported.4. The performance on this game is a joke (Overclocked GTX 1080ti just hits a stable 60fps on 1440p)5. The aggravating way you CANNOT skip cutscenes.6. In my opinion this game looks way worse than I expected. There are a lot of reasons for this game though such as:1. It's completely unique to anything on the market right now or even in development. 2. The thrill of defeating a large mosnter. You cannot defeat a boss in just 1 minute by glitching it, you have to stick to a 10 minute + fight hitting weakspots.3. Diverse range of weapons for every play style.4. Vast upgrading system for weapons and armour development throughout the game.There are many more reasons, if you have a decent PC and a fat wallet then try this game. There is a certain constant GRIND for pretty much every second in the game but if you don't like it then just refund it :)I highly recommend this game!
Natt	Recommended	31.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkNatt/	As a monster hunter veteran and someone that helped many get into the series, I can’t recommend this game enough. It is my game of the year for sure. I played the Xbox version for over 500 hours (nearly 100 %ed it) and looking to do the same with this one. Even after doing pretty much all this game has to offer I will still play it. I already have way more friends to play with now that it is on PC, and that’s great!If you know nothing about Monster Hunter it is essentially a game where you hunt monsters. Constant mini raid bosses that can take up to 50 minutes sometimes. The leveling up in this game just unlocks more quests, not stats! It is long endurance fight for parts to make a variety of weapons and armors. It honestly makes the grind fun. Even though you are hunting for all these parts the game is essentially relying on your skill. A skilled player can beat this whole game without wearing a single piece of armor. The armor is just to make things interesting with the combination of skills you can come up with to customize your playstyle. The game rewards using items to make fights easier and almost feels like you are planning a hunt any time you come across a new monster. Each monster has unique strategies to learn and plan for. The game rewards reaction time and learning the movement of the monster like real hunting as well.Everyone is welcome here and it is awesome! If you are new to Monster Hunter this is the one to get into! The game is much easier to learn and get used to. Older Monster Hunter games took like 20 hours before you go “oh yeah I got it”. This took about 4 or so from what I seen with the newcomers I tagged along with.  If you are a veteran of Monster Hunter you will most likely love it if you can accept change to a more modern game. I still go back to old ones and play them for that unique experience but this game is so worth it! There seems to be a split in games now, which is totally awesome in my opinion. Old school vs new school. This monster hunter is the modern new school and if you are old school you can fit right in as one of the cool kids. Before you buy you have to remember some things. The beginning will seem overwhelming if you never played a Monster Hunter, but if you stick with it you will find a great game I feel. Each weapon has a learning curve, some easier than others. But each with a depth to be found and enjoyed. Most weapons are super unique and change the way you play the game completely so if you aren’t enjoying one, try another. The game can be soloed (I soloed or did duos with one friend most of my first time through the game), but it is so much better with friends. The online community for Monster Hunter has always been welcoming so if you don’t want to solo you can easily find a group willing to do hunts with you. Since I am a bitter old man I only like to hunt with my friends. I will solo before joining randoms. Some quests have to be started solo and if you are playing with friends, that can be annoying. Once the cutscene is triggered it its joinable though. So just have your friends back out and join you or vise versa. Other then that just take your time with it and learn the game at your own pace!Now if you own the PS4 or Xbox version and want to double dip like myself I highly suggest it. I was blown away in the first few minutes of this game. The game looks gorgeous. I played on an original Xbox One and the graphics were acceptable (Monster Hunter has never been about the graphics so I didn’t mind) but oh my god. It’s like receiving a random nude from your crush at 4 in the morning when I opened this up. It’s beautiful. I may get ripped a new one here but frame rate as long as it’s higher than 30 doesn’t ruin a game for me. As long as it’s fun it rarely bothers me. But the uncapped frame rate here is just like taking my favorite dessert and saying “HEY NO CALORIES WITH THAT BAD BOY, EAT UP!”. I also have way more friends to play with on PC cause a majority of them have PC’s over consoles. So, if you have few good people you want to make a hunting party with then go for it!Like I said this is my favorite game of 2018 and its going to take a miracle of a game to beat this for me. I gladly will buy this game twice… which I did just to experience it with a PC coat of paint and more friends. TLDR: interested in it? give it a shot. It has a learning curve but not as bad as previous installments. Owned it on consoles? Buy it again anyway cause this game is a great PC port.A veteran afraid of “new” MH? I was willing to accept the modern twist on it. The old ones will always be there to experience again.

So you get gimped because it has more health and does more damge. - Abymssal FPS drops - especially when more hunters join, game in general runs pretty 'average' (I'm on a 1080ti, i5 4670k @ 4.6ghz, 16gb ram etc)- My god fix the mouse, i shouldn't have to do INI files to get a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥fix- Motion blur - why?- Having to watch cutscenes before you can join others etc on quests????????????????????I shouldnt have to be downgrading drivers etc to get the game to run well, but the main issue is the disconnects - like it happens constantly and really ruins the game. Like i said I'll amend my review once things have been changed. But other then that the game is extremely fun.

(before downgrade, fps around 10, after downgrade, went back to solid 30fps)This game is design for pattern learning,time invest, gear grinding.so if people that keep die and keep complain about the game have bad enemy design. git gudso far the problem is on multiplayer, which not bother me much as i solo player.give them some time to fix the problem.If you want a good singleplayer game, go get it, is not bad.

LordTyr85	Not Recommended	42.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/terminator_bs/	It is a good game, but due to several issues I cannot give it a positive review.First of all, co-op is EXTREMELY tedious. If you want to play your story quest with a friend, you have to watch the mission's cutscene first, otherwise you cannot play it in a party. The cutscene can be in the middle of the mission, which means you have to play half a mission, leave, and then join a friend to play it together. EVERY time. It's extremely annoying.Second, the PC port is not that great. It works, performance seems alright, but the second you try to move the mouse you'll feel that it moves completely wrong. It has negative acceleration and smoothing which is used for  a controller cursor, not a PC mouse. An easy change for any decent port, it was ignored here. There is also some motion blur which cannot be turned off, but it's not terrible in this game.If both the Co-op and the mouse issue get fixed, I will change my review to positive. But until then, know what you're getting into if you're thinking about buying this game.

Don't buy it until it's patched... alot.-Aweful optimization: don't expect 1080p 60fps on anything but top-level hardware unless you turn every graphics option to low, making the game look worse than consoles on what is definitely better hardware than they run.-Graphical bugs: Weapon fx, specifically thunder ones, destroy your fps when they hit monsters. Get a group of players using them and a line graph of your fps will look like the Andes Mountains.-Broken Fullscreen: Setting the game to fullscreen causes periodic crashes on startup, crashes during the end credits, and crashes when alt-tabbing.-Bugged Monster encounters: Attempting to fight the final boss with a group causes the host to crash every time.-Connectivity issues: Frequent disconnects from game sessions, made worse by the fact that when a player disconnects to an offline session, the monster they were fighting maintains its multiplayer-scaled stats for the player to face solo.-Broken Steam Notifications: When someone is playing monster hunter, their steam friends will recieve "xxx is now playing MHW" notifications whenever they start/leave a mission. If you are playing monster hunter with friends, these notifications will cover up your item hotbar every three seconds. The only solution has been to completely disable steam notifications.-Lack of pc options: Get motion sick from motion blur / depth of field or want to change your FoV? Tough.-Denuvo

World and capcom gave me this, it is why i preorder the deluxe edition the story is rich the graphics are insane and its everything i wanted and more in the last few years. I have played this game nonstop and will continue to bond with friends and make new ones on this game i am excitied that a game i have waited for was finally created. Granted the clunky controls of the DS are just now a echo of what is brought forth this game is a masterpiece of its own. 10/10.

Sippc	Not Recommended	150.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/harbslive/	If MHW was a single player game I would have given it a great review, but unfortunately one of the things capcom prides itself on is that Monster Hunter World is a multiplayer game. Take that with a grain of salt though, because it's one of the most unstable and inconsistent mutiplayer experiences you can get for $60. Don't buy the game. Not now, maybe not ever if they don't fix this. I'm nearing the point where over half my multiplayer games have ended with that enfuriating "you have entered offline mode" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t popup. So don't get Monster Hunter World if you want to play with friends, or with strangers, or with anybody.
Jars	Recommended	74.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kelvang/	I have loved Monster Hunter for a very long time so this review might be a little biased. That being said I adore this game and all the new features that it brings to the table. A whole lot of the features from past Monster Hunter games are returning as well in new flavors such as Palico Quests coming back as the Tailrider Safaris or Moga Farms reappearing as cultivatable items. This is the perfect jumping on point for new players, with easy to learn controls (Even on the PC!) and a slew of new beginner friendly features that only serve to enhance gameplay for veterans, like the scoutflies and the SOS beacons. Tracking a monster and battling it through each distinct environment as both the world and monster accrue battle damage and you gives you a true feeling of accomplishment that few games can pull off and with that I wholeheartedly recommend this game.Graphically the game can get a little intense, your PC might chug a little bit on higher settings but the game will look beautiful if you can manage it. Aesthetically I love the game, each new environment and monster is very unique. The servers have been having a little bit of an issue, if I were to give this game one bump and it would be a huge bump it would be the server stability. I rarely get disconnected from games but I have ungodly amounts of trouble connecting to them.
NyxCrab	Recommended	454.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NyxCrab/	If you want a game where you just run around beating up huge monsters with a weapon larger than you are, this is the game for you. Despite how simple the weapons seem at first, every weapon has a surprising amount of depth to them both in combos and positioning when fighting monsters. It's addicting as all hell too, and can be really challenging even if sometimes that challenge feels cheap, most of the time it's fair and there's ways to avoid some of the more annoying attacks. Soundtrack is amazing too and it helps make hunts versus harder monsters feel that much more badass. The connection problems are pretty much entirely fixed at this time and it's not that hard to find SOS's SO LONG AS YOU REMEMBER TO NOT JUST USE "Low Rank" OR "High Rank" WHEN SEARCHING. That is a bit annoying, but it wasn't annoying enough to really annoy me once I figured that out. I highly recommend this game.

Pros: Graphics, Story, Gameplay, Multiple Character Slots, Upgrade TreeCons: Matchmaking system, Hub Area, Random DisconnectsPROS: The Graphics and Gameplay are determined on what computer you have. The Multiple Character Slots is good if you have another person that uses your computer and wants to play Monster Hunter: World. The Upgrade Tree at the beginning is slow but after 10 or so monster fights you get an expanding tree to upgrade your weaponry.CONS: The Matchmaking System for me ruined the experience to play with other people either my friends or random people I would've liked to meet playing this game. Sadly the Main Hub for you and others to meet isn't in the Tradeyard or Canteen but in a seperate area called the Gathering Hub, so you cant meme with your friends in the spawning area of Astera. (READ) The random disconnects in hunts made this game unplayable with other people and honestly made me hate this game to the point where I say NO to anyone who wants to buy something overpriced $60 AAA game that has worse servers than MW2, A.K.A 2009 servers on a 2018 AAA game.

Weiss	Recommended	98.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198299159029/	MERITS:The only reason I am going to recommend this game is that when it works, it really works. As of now it is very tedious to play the game properly with your friends. A lot of people are saying the menus are confusing but they really aren't after you connect a few times and figure it out. The game is very extensive and very fun to play. Every time you kill a new monster no matter if it is the main target or something as small as a bug (yes an actual bug) its very fun to find new armor sets that you can make from their parts. The weapon system is fairly straight forward and easy to understand. Overall the game is very very good, and if I could give it a rating out of 10 at this moment in time, I would probably give it a 7.5. They just really need to get it together and fix the game so people on PC can actually enjoy playing it without being interupted everytime they engage a monster.CRITIQUES:One very annoying issue I have been having lately is that my friend and I are trying to do hunts together but as soon as we finally find our target and engage it, we disconnect from each other. It seems to work a little better with 3-4 players for whatever reason. The only ACTUAL problem with it, is that Capcom decided to release the vanilla game with no patches or hotfixes installed. So we basically have the console launch version and all of the disconnects, lagging and frame drops that came with it when the game first came out instead of them releasing a fixed game.

Maledict	Not Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079127132/	If you're looking to play Multiplayer/ co-op with your friends I highly reccomend either refunding or waiting until the currently terrible system that is currently in place for multiplayer is fixed. However if you are looking for a good monster hunter world experience to play solo then it is a pretty damn good game. Optimization is a problem sadly but that can be fixed over time and it is still in a few days of release so this type of stuff will probably be fixed in the short future.      Good- Combat is pretty decent and feels incredibly satisfying and rewarding when defeating monsters.- Progression (as ive seen so far) is pretty well done not too challenging but not too easy- Customization is excellent as far as weapons, clothing, character and equipment- Cats- Story as far as I've gone into is really interesting and well made.- No crashes as far as ive played which is pretty good for a first day first PC release company.- Great experience for both a previous Monster Hunter player as well as people who may be newer to the series or never played at all       Bad-M U L T I P L A Y E R. as expressed above multiplayer hardly ever works. The system is overlycomplex, kicks people who have not seen the same cutscene and forced rejoin, and constant connection disconnects every few minutes. I cannot give it a thumbs up until at least this is fixed. The only time it has worked for me and from what I have seen from other reviews is when you and your group are in the central hub, but expeditions and quests (main part of the game where you actually do things) hardly ever work.-Current PC optimization. Made for console instead of PC, no options for motion blur and screen tearing. (assume that these will be resolved in the near future). Fairly difficult for lower spec computers to run smoothly even at the lowest graphics settings sadly-Controls. Subjective for person to person but i feel that a majority will feel the same way. CONTROLLER HIGHLY RECCOMMENDED - Mouse movements feel like a joystick and do not work smoothly. Multiple buttons for the same effect, cant use a radial menu while moving, awkward keybindings (however these can be mapped so ultimately its up to you, just the initial feel is awkward)- Lock on System. I assume this will be fixed shortly as well. The lock on system works well when fighting a single monster. Keeps you on target. However when fighting multiple enemies the target constantly changes with small movements. Deadzone needs to be fixed.Overall---It is a great game that people will definitely play and enjoy once it is optimized and better ported. I think as their first PC release it is actually pretty good despite my own and several other reviews. but until AT LEAST the multplayer issue is fixed I cannot reccomend this game. If you're looking for a good solo experience however I would reccomend this game to you. I'll change my review once the multiplayer issue is fixed

Donut Steel	Recommended	94.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cruisebaka/	Now that they've fixed the online its deserving of a positive review.
Maulman	Recommended	163.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YouGotMauled/	I really cannot stress enough how flawed the review balance for this game is right now. It's sickening to see that people are hating so heavily off of what was told by capcom to be a port, sold as a port, for the first time for the series on a PC platform. The game functions as advertised. It's very entertaining, minimal FPS drops, and engaging gameplay with characters. Sure, the cutscenes and NPCs are off because the animations are still for the Japanese language. But you can get over it very quickly with how little impact it is towards the game as a whole.What I will address seperately is: The multiplayer problem:I live in Japan. This is a very hard place to be from, when all of your friends are foreign.I am friends with a lot of foreigners. I am playing Japan to Austrailia or Japan to Germany, literally all the time.I can connect with such little issue to them that it is often the Austrailian's internet that prevents them from playing with me. I have never been so badly disconnected that in the middle of a fight with one of the bigger monsters in the game (i.e. Rathalos, Diablos) I have been left alone. It's probably not the servers. It's you.Now onto the rest of my review.21:9 Support? use a 3rd party program to force the ratio.This game was not meant to be played on keyboard and mouse. Treat it like souls and buy yourself a wired controller. You can use it for other games as well. I'm sorry if you can't.The UI is meant to be simplified for consoles but is honestly still crap. Bad for organization and those with intense OCD qualities like yours truly.TL:DR: Game's good at heart, polished to near perfection, but a little clunky around the edges.If you can't treat it like it wants to be treated, like a woman, it will scorn you.
Just Toshi	Recommended	230.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JustToshi/	Monster Hunter: WorldThis game is at the top of my favourites right now!The only thing I've personally had is disconnects to servers, For example: Me and 2 other friends were all hunting together killing a monster and all of a sudden, I or one of them get disconnected, Now this can be a major pain in the butt, But it's only just been released.I don't expect it to be perfect on release!Now for the good stuff;Hunting: Oh my god, This stuff gets intense when you run out of heals and youre on your last life, god does it get your blood pumping! My personal experience, The mongrel Diablos, God I spent hours hunting him to get a kill/capture on him!Many times I wanted to just stop, But I just couldn't, You get sucked in pretty bad (Or atleast I do). Multiplayer Hunts: These can be really funny, Watching your friend get constant CC chained then proceeds to die can be hilarious, Grouping up can have its pros and cons:Pros being; You can all smash a monster together, You can gather materials together aswell it's a good experience all round in my opinion!Cons being; If you group up with a bunch of randoms, Sometimes they dont pull their weight, Either it being them doing no damage or them dying constantly causing the mission to fail and you lose all progress. It can be frustrating wasting 25 mins on a hunt for it to go down the drain... Thats the main con other than the one I listed at the beggining (Disconnecting)But, Overall I've got something like 35 hours on my character and I'm just hitting the harder content, Ive enjoyed every single bit of it. I highly reccoment this game! Its a fun game to jump on with a bunch of friends and even making friends!Hope you enjoyed this review and it wasn't toooooooo long!Happy hunting!Toshi~EDIT: Just lost all 190 hours of work due to a bug they haven't fixed yet, Theres absolutely nothing I can do about it unless I backed up the save files prior to now, I wasn't informed it was an issue so I did not backup anything. BE CAREFUL EVERYONE, BACKUP NOW!
.Quan	Recommended	52.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198317503310/	Shouldn't even take some time to write a proper review because everyone reading this review knows that this game is beautiful! It's that simple. Have a nice Day.
Sizz-Lorr	Recommended	318.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079353217/	 Summary  The PC launch of MHW has seen some issues, nonetheless it is amazing overall experience! Don't be scared off by the reviews immediately. Yes there are connection issues and nobody enjoys/wants them, Capcom and Valve included. At this very moment there are 305k people in game, 8500 thumbs down is  less than 3 percent of that . Please look around before passing on this gem.  Also the entirety of the game can be played solo if that's your cup of tea.  However it's extremely playable in MP, in my 56 hours on record (atm) I have been in at least a lobby or out in a hunt with at least 1 friend throughout the entirety. On average about 7 or so of us play consistently together in the same lobby and split into varying groups for hunts. Thats not to say we haven't had error messages or "failed to join quests",  but it's so quick to hop right back in it. Ofc it can be annoying, but just knowing little things to get around certain issues helps too. It's a game that may require patience to learn your enemy, learn your weapon, and keep standing back up after getting beatdown. All in all, Monster Hunter Worlds is truly an amazing game becoming one of my favorites of all time, and it honestly would be a shame if you didn't at least try it.  Connection and related issues To elaborate more on this, the headlining and most frustrating is the "Connection lost" message during a hunt.As hunts in multiplayer are scaled up, unless the monster is almost dead is it best to just leave if you are stuck solo. There are two options to leaving a quest, "Abandon Quest" and "Return from Quest". Abandoning allows you to return the hub in the state you were before the hunt started, allowing you to keep all items you may have used up, but losing anything you picked up during the quest. The other option simply returns you as you are, keeping any new things you gained, but on the same note any items used will remain expended. The issue seems to be a little unique but once someone usually dc/d, that person could not find the same session again. Somehow their connection, and perception of it, was totally lost. So we'd just remake a new lobby, takes literally less than 30 seconds from the hub and joining in is usually less than that. Though I did note that things seemed to get better everyday, with especially yesterday (8/13/2018) being able to join back and also joining in on story quests that used to always give "Failed to Join" messages. Failed to join is the another common issue, you simply try to join someone's quest and you cannot. Story seems to especially susceptible to it, but as I mentioned it really seemed to be clearing up a lot yesterday. Cutscenes cannot be skipped, nor can they be watched together. So the easiest way to play these quests together is to post the quest and go in solo (you can still be in the MP lobby) get to the cutscene, then return/abandon and repost the quest from the hub. Then everybody should be able join in that has already watched the cutscene. PC Port quality etc I see that the other main complaint is against the quality of the port and the extent of graphical options and such we are given. I have played a lot of ports, including many Bandai Namco games, and I have to say MHW is a great port on PC. Like did nobody here play Dark Souls 1, 2 or even 3?? Not the best or amazing for sure, but has a good many options, good customisable keybindings (including side mouse butons etc). Frame limits can be 30, 60, or Unlimited. You can use a controller, but mouse and keyboard are great, and with almost everything being remappable you can find what works best for you. There is NOT an option to turn off motion blur but I don't really notice the blur being intense like many other games, but I also always keep it on in my games I tend to like it or at least not care. Some resolutions or widescreen may not be supported, so if thats something serious to you definitely look into what is supported for your setup. I play on the higest graphics settings, with my FPS ranging from mid 40s to mid 65s. I haven't bothered turning down settings and seeing what FPS I get because this game runs super smooth and plays nicely. I have a launch edition gtx 1080 or whatever, but Capcom really put the focus in development to the gameplay running smoothly. My fps stays around the range, the low end is when I'm in a lava area with enviromental effects and lava spewing up with two monsters running around with explosive scales going off and all 4 of us trying to murder their faces. I think the game runs smooth and crisp, and while the graphics may be missing some options that some PC players might want, I cannot stress enough that it seems like such a minor thing to let ruin the whole experience. As long as you can run and play the game, it's about the overall experience and it definitely delivers. Sadly if you can't get it to run no matter what, there's always steam refund. The Meat of the Matter I tried to address what I saw as the two main complaints first without rambling on too much, because I think it's important to note that MHW is currently at 46% positive reviews out of just over 17k (at this time). However if you look at the community hub and steam player chart statitistics, this game has barely once dipped below 200k players at ALL times since launch day. Thats all through the night, even at odd hours and typical low times. This game has been sitting steady around the number 4 most played game on steam since it's release, right behind the usual behemoth top 3 PUBG, Dota 2, and PUBG.  MHW has become the most successful Japanese game on steam, surpassing even the Dark Soul series. With such a large and consistent player base, and roughly 54% of reviewers having a thumbs down is roughly over 8500 people, I cannot stress enough to not be turned off by such a minor statistic. That's not to say it's good because a lot of people are playing it, that you should ignore all the negative reviews and just buy it, or whatever comes to mind. Look around, look past the initial red thumbs down and the top two reviews say bad pc port and severe connection issues. As I have gone over, those issues do exist but not at all the extent you might think by just browsing the negative reviews. At this very moment there are 305k people in game, 8500 thumbs down is  less than 3 percent of that . But enough of beating that dead horse, I feel like I should actually talk about the gameplay for those of who you may not be familiar with the series or haven't already been watching videos on the game. Monster Hunter is a game series that essentially boils down to big boss fights. In Worlds, that is big boss fights in beautiful seamless maps with no loading between zones and many many quality of life upgrades from the old handheld bound titles. Yes there are little small fries too, its not just one big boss in an arena. One of the themes of Worlds, is well...being a world. The maps look amazing but the focus on detail of being simulating an actual ecosystem is immersing. Many large monsters can roam the through the forests as your tracking and hunting one specific target, there are many species of small monsters native to the different maps, and tons of endemic life throughout. I highly recommend watching Making of Monster Hunter video series. Also check out the "All weapon types gameplay trailer" to get an idea as well. The core of gameplay revolves around two parts, monsters and weapons. There are 14 weapon types, and these are almost akin to classes in other games. The movesets, attacks, playstyle, it will all be quite different from one another. It's a game that may require patience to learn your enemy, learn your weapon, and keep standing back up after getting beatdown. Check out Arekkz & Gaijin Hunter for guides

JarmyBob	Not Recommended	4.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198301204339/	Boring. If you like doing one thing over and over to get better gear to do that thing better again, then you will like this game. Oddly CPU intensive, with GPU twiddling it's thumbs most of the time. Some of the more "complex" weapons have little to no explanation as to how the heck they work (Insect Glave, looking at you). I couldnt seem to remap the controler functions, so ended up play this with a mouse, and still had issues with keys just ignoring me some times (yea, its you again Insect Glave, Sometimes you shoot the bug out, sometimes you dont). This is a hard game, even though I never died. I felt less as if I was fighting the monsters and more the controls. One mistake and you are punished harshly, by having to play longer to kill the target :| If using the two handed sword, if you miss might as well sheath and then run, because you will never get in range with it drawn out.  I saw videos of flowing combat, combos, and cool moves, but I look like a blind man swinging at bananas. Maybe I suck, maybe game sucks, maybe I would of gotten more enjoyment with pizza and beer worth the $50+.  If you like the monster hunter games you will like this game, if you never played one, probably not. At least wait till they fix the graphic issues and maybe it goes on sale:)

As it is, if you want to play online/with friends, DO NOT BUY!  Way to many connection issues and problems with disconnecting that make an otherwise good game a test in dealing with frustration.Until they fix the connection issues, I would hold off.  Once it';s confirmed that they've been fixed, then I would say it's a great game.
ᖫ✧ŴɅVΞ✧ᖭ	Recommended	203.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mashunt/	I am a huge MH fan and have been playing it since the Monster Hunter 2 and collecting all of the MH series until now.I love this one because it's unique than the other MH series. We can enjoy a free-roaming experience through an "Expedition" to gather all of the resources we wanted without a time limit, where the natural resources are regenerable and has many large monsters in that area.This come really convenient instead of accepting a 50 min ticket delivery quest in a certain area with a limited resources and with only 1 large monster. It's really sad when I saw the reviews where people are crying about Denuvo and toggable options. But this game has a gorgeous graphic, epic gameplay, and an astounding storyline.However, this game should improve on its connectivity and a better controller support.Edit:The developer is working hard to improve this game. However, many people found this game become boring and they do not know what to do once they reached HR 100. In my personal opinion, by adding more events and variation of monsters with new fighting pattern or something very unique could improve this game a lot.I know the developer is currently working on adding Lagiacrus into the game ^_^Extra:Paolumu is killing me because of its fluffiness... why..why is it so FLUFFY?!and also, I miss Chameleos, Qurupeco, and GigginoxExtra 2:Why there's no Additional Gesture Bundle 2 T_T 
Spookie Texie™	Recommended	57.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TexieThunder/	Yet to encounter issues running the game, I capped my FPS at 60FPS and it's maintained that almost perfectly the entire time on the highest settings.  Playing with an Xbox controller everything feels just as smooth as it should.Keep in mind that the first hour of this game is almost entirely cutscenes and moving from A to B.   That's allotting some time to create your character and palico, so your 2 hour refundable "trial" if you are doing that won't be much time to experience all the game has to offer.. The game is alot more fun if you have a friend or friends to play with, though the multiplayer allows for randoms to help you and talk to you, and there's some auto-chat messages in combat to help you know what your ally's might be up to e.g. "Mounted the beast" or your Palico informing that they need to heal you. But yeah, as of writing this I have 6 hours so this is more of a first impression kind of review, but so far I have nothing to complain about aside from some monster fights becoming a little tiresome after a bit.

Now about this Monster Hunter, I'm not a hardcore fan of this saga, I played at the time a PSP game and it was fun but now that I have this I must say, even with the simplifications to make things easier to newcomers, it plays really well and combats are interesting, I just made my first big monster and had a great moment with the objectives. So yeah, I think I recommend this game, it looks beautiful, runs fine and play wonderfully, I don't think you will be disappointed (I hope)

Esterlin	Not Recommended	81.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/InquisitiveDuck/	A decent game brought low by far too many bugs and glitches.Their netcode is among one of the worst I've ever seen. Good luck finishing any mission multiplayer as the game will constantly drop network connection.Certain monsters will suddenly gain MASSIVE phantom range, hitting you from literally opposite ends of the arena despite the animation not being anywhere remotely close. I attribute this to a desync issue as it typically happens when you were in a multiplayer lobby, although I have had it rarely happen during offline fights as well.Controls are about what you can expect from a Monster Hunter game, but with the presence of occasional control issues. For example, a command not going through or buttons becoming nonresponsive.These are only some of the more frustrating and prominent bugs in the game, there are plenty more. If these bugs didn't exist, I'd recommend the game.

The mouse emulates a joystick and it doesn't even do that well. Sure you can go find the .inf files and adjust the default mouse sensitivity to make it better, but it is by no means a fix.

Ciraeon	Not Recommended	45.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992496144/	Not recommended at this point in time.For background, I have several hundred hours on the PS4 version as well as prior MH versions on DS.The current state of the game feels like a poor PC port, only made worse by the expectation that after waiting 6 months for the PC release so they could 'get it right', they ported it poorly.Pros: + Fairly well optimized, if anything it's a prettier game than console. + Fast loading times are a much better QoL improvement.Cons: -- The controls are horrid. Having to rebind is problematic, since you are binding vague classes of actions, not actions themselves. Getting melee and ranged comfortable to play requires them to have wholely different, and still unintuitive at times, control schemes since it requires buttons to be moved for one mode and not others.--- Online is broken. For a team game whose PS4 online implementation was essentially bulletproof, but not flawless (parties that would be consistent through runs, rather than having to disband every. damn. time.) the online just doesn't work. You will constantly get disconnected, you will constantly have failed to joined quests even though you are on Discord with your friend. You will get dropped from lobbies, you will have lobbies entirely disappear and dump everyone in them out into their own offline instance. You cannot attempt to rejoin aside from failing your mission then going back to town and manually trying to reconnect and rejoin. After PS4's multiplayer made MH so good to play in groups, this is a horrible thing to do to a great game.-- Obviously a port. Sometimes keyboarding works. Sometimes it doesn't. Enter generally works when you need to confirm somethine, backspace and esc are less likely. So many "This button does 4-5 things" situations when we have a whole keyboard we could use for binds. And then the keyboard version of the radial menu (which isn't enabled by default, which is BS) is entirely unbindable.Verdict: Playable if you enjoy the series and game. If you have the option, keep playing it on console or hold off buying until it's fixed. If you're a solo player, the broken online won't matter and it will just be an annoying to control game instead of a vast disappointment.

Docdic	Recommended	131.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Docdic/	After playing the older games (3u/4u/freedom) It's a breath of fresh air to the series. It takes the foundation of the older games and builds up on it. The maps are no longer broken up into separate sections that need their own load screen to enter. And all the weapons have been given brand new mechanics to them making them feel more diverse and deep. However with the changes to the game over previous titles it also lacks some of the longevity that titles like 4u and the new generations u have. By that I mean the amount of monster added to the game and the addition of G-rank. In world there is only 24 (about only 21 on pc currently) in the game, and more to come. While on the 3ds title there was 70. In the end world is a step in the right direction. However it's like your grandpa who went to walk up the stairs to go the bathroom but instead only make it 3/4 the way there and♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants instead. I would reccomend this game if you have never played a monster hunter game before and want to know what it's all about.

For those just entering the series it's the perfect game. I fully admit there were some excessively detailed and often bothersome mechanics in the previous games. I think this one over-simplifies many aspects to the point of being boring (like putting cool drink mushrooms at the entrance of every lava zone), but most of the ease of life changes are much appreciated (like not having to go to the wiki to look up monster weaknesses). Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Very enjoyable, but slightly too easy.

Roberto	Recommended	171.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Silenvar/	What is Monster Hunter: WorldMonster Hunter: World is an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom. A part of the Monster Hunter series, it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version in August 2018.In the game, the player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces. If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of parts from the monster and other elements that are used to craft weapons and armor, amongst other equipment.The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down more difficult monsters, which in turn provide parts that lead to more powerful gear. Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of up to four players via the game's online services.GAMEPLAYMonster Hunter: World is an open-world action role-playing game played from a third-person perspective. Similar to previous games in the series, the player takes the role of a player-created character who travels to the "New World", an unpopulated land mass filled with monsters, to join the Research Commission that study the land from their central command base of Astera.The Research Commission tasks the Hunter to hunt down and either kill or capture large monsters that roam outside Astera to both protect the Commission and to study the monsters there.The player's character does not have any intrinsic attributes, but instead these are determined by what equipment the character is equipped with. This includes a weapon, selected from the series' fourteen archetypes (such as long sword, bow, or hammer), which then further defines the types of combat moves and abilities the player can use, and pieces of armor, which can lead to beneficial or detrimental combat skills if matched properly.While some basic equipment can be purchased using in-game money, most equipment is built from loot obtained by slaying or trapping monsters, rewards from completing quests, or items gathered while in the field. This creates a core loop of gameplay that has the player fight monsters they can beat to obtain the right loot to craft improved weapons and armor to allow them to face more powerful monsters and the potential for even better equipment.How to start huntingAfter taking a quest in Astera, or after choosing to simply go on an open-ended expedition, the player is taken to a base camp in one of six large regions that make up the New World. Each region is made up of numbered zones, but unlike previous Monster Hunter games, these zones are seamlessly connected, and there are no loading screens when moving between zones.The player must traverse zone to zone, though they can quick-travel to any of the base camps in that particular region when outside of combat. From camp, the player can acquire limited provisions, rest to restore their health, and new to World, have a meal that provides limited-time buffs to the player.The player sets out to track down monsters, which in World is aided with the use of Scout flies, which hover near tracks and other signs of large monsters, or highlight resources that the player can collect such as flora, ores, bones, and insects. Investigate the traces of the monster leads to improving the Scout flies' abilities for the quest, eventually enabling them to lead the player via their glowing flight path towards the monster they seek; further, investigating these help the player to gain research towards the monster that helps them gain insight on its strengths, weaknesses, and behavior.PLATFORMS' DIFFERENCESThe PS4 Pro and Xbox One X players gave you a tough choice where you could either prioritise visuals, frame rate or resolution – depending on your preference.Even when you opted for framerate it was clear the consoles were at their limit. Playing on the PS4 Pro though, you can still notice drops, even when you set it as a priority.On PC you’re free to tweak the settings to your heart’s content, so in theory, if your hardware is up to it, you can have all three and play Monster Hunter World with its graphics maxed in 4K at 60fps-plus framerates.PROSBeautiful and varied worldsSo much depth to its systemsStory is actually engaging.

P.Ya	Recommended	128.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/flushedtoiletpyaper/	As an absolute MH fan this game is a blast, finally seeing some quality visuals. As someone who is discovering the series ? It's probably a good starting point, definitely the most accessible title of the MH franchise so far. Objectively speaking though, it suffers from quite a few issues. I'll list both pros and cons below in no particular order :Pros :+ Gorgeous graphics, the most obvious one (just compare to older titles and the upcoming MHGU which was the latest entry in Japan before MHW)+ Easy to pick up and play, the convulated systems of the previous games are much more simple now, and everything is explained.+ Training grounds to try your weapons on a static dummy.+ Ability to revert some weapon upgrades (as well as getting the materials refunded)+ This one is subjective, but I love the verticality and complexity of the maps in this game.+ Slinger and specialized tools are nice additions and don't feel gimmicky in that they have actual, consistent uses.+ Very short loading times (in comparison to stock consoles). My game is installed on a SSD and I have 4 ~ 5s loading screens.+ Ability to see the entire upgrade tree of any weapon instead of resorting to 3rd party resources such as Kiranico or the MH Wiki+ Quick access items / Inventory wheel. Beats having to scroll through your entire list of consumables before finding the right item any day mid-quest.+ In the same vein, a lot of information was made readily available in-game, although a lot of it is still vague (but at least it's there). It's more than enough information for the casual player to soak in and make educated decisions.+ Most weapons have revamped, more practical and streamlined movesets.+ More tasks to do in-between quests, more rewarding systems, etc...+ Expeditions (free play in the maps of your choice, no time and death limits)+ No more needs for consumable tools to collect stuff, and collecting and carving in general is much smoother (also hooray for invincibility + super armor carving at the end of a quest)+ Some more details that'll speak more to veteran players than newcomersCons :- Connectivity issues, the most obvious one. Despite having (at the time of writing) 62 hours logged into the game and greatly enjoying it so far, I have without exaggerating spent 7 to 8 hours trying to join friends' sessions (or them join mine) and abandonning quests midway because someone disconnected.- Menus. I find they're a massive cluster**** for a reason I can't fathom. This however might be because I'm very used to the old games' menus, which were very similar to each other and have changed very little over time.- Performance issues. Although my PC can run the game just fine thanks to my specs (above recommended), there were niche instances where everything would stutter or the frames drop. This has only happened during the last Kushala phase with its tornadoes and tempest weather. Might have happened a couple times during VFX-heavy moments where 4 players and the monster would use their flashy moves at the same time.- No one uses the gathering hub (multiplayer hub where you see other players before questing). You can do everything from Astera's lower levels directly and don't need to access the hub to host and start multiplayer quests.- I'm nitpicking on this one but I find it annoying to spawn at the front Astera gate after a quest. I'd rather spawn at the 1F elevator so that I can skip running through the first floor to get to the canteen, or otherwise still have the same distance to run to the 1F NPCs if I have business with them.- Why is the Handler so derpy...- Multiplayers slots remain filled when someone leaves mid-quest or get disconnected so you can't ever have a full party anymore during the remainder of the quest if that happens. Super annoying with the recurrent connectivity issues.- Game is easy in comparison to older games. Also indirectly related to the fact that there is currently no G Rank.All in all, I'd say the game is great. A lot of the needlessly complex systems are much simpler now or have been straight up removed, The game simply suffers from a few - but glaring - issues that must not be overlooked by Capcom. The thing is, as it stands, a unpolished gem and I sincerely hope the game gets fixed sooner rather than later, both to save face towards the new players and making the experience as close to flawless as possible.As for whether I recommend it, I think I've successfully made 20+ people that were on the fence about getting it, buy it, and so far no regrets.Arbitrary score : 7/10

MaskedMouse	Recommended	125.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027662208/	Fun and addicting game. Recommended to play together with friends and do the story solo!Pros:- Feels like an adventure!- Fun to farm, doesn't feel like a chore- Moderate / good difficulty scaling, sometimes difficulty spikes- Feels like an achievement hunting the more difficult monsters successfully- Good intro / tutorial information- Fun to play with friends, advisable to play the storyline solo- Overall a good port, had no crashes whatsoever. No memory leaks.- Can be played casually and hardcore!Cons:- Settings require a little tweaking so that the FPS doesn't drop. Audio to surround sound and headset.Personal opinion Cons:- Somewhat limited character creation customization, a lot of options feel the same. Couldn't really find a face for the character that I liked.- Max 4 player co-op, sometimes we have 5 players meaning someone has to sit one out. Would've liked to see bigger maps for 5 or 6 players. But I can understand for performance and balance that 4 is a maximum.- Server issues at release, but they're working on a fix! It made me fail a hunt somewhere at the beginning of the game. Also occured just about starting an arena quest with friends, we got seperated from eachother at the start due to this issue. Had quite a difficult fight alone.- Rewards for investigation quests feel a bit off. 10k for an easy vespoid quest that takes 3 min, compared to a hunt quest that gives the same amount but takes a lot longer to complete, like 15~30 minutes. When the quest is done with multiple ppl it splits the money reward making the quest reward even less attractive. Some quests have low time and low reward whereas others have high time and high reward. Just feels off.- Constantly spams Steam Friends that they play the game, a bug that requires to be fixed soon.What I like about monster hunter world is that the farm required doesn't feel like a chore to do. It's actually fun to farm.It has moderate / good difficulty scaling, things feel like an achievement and not being all that easy to complete at times. Which is nice.It is sad to see ppl complaining about either Denuvo, FPS or Server issues.Denuvo doesn't kill performance of MHW, I don't even notice it is in there.FPS is fine as long as you tweak your settings, there are so many hardware configurations for PC that creating a setting that works for everyone is just difficult. I've set Volume Rendering Quality to variable, the overall suggestion is turning this off to increase performance. Yes the game is CPU intensive, got an i7 6700k @ 4.5 GHz overclocked to support it. Do I have FPS drops? pretty much none.Server issues are just starting issues, probably a too high load for the servers. They're working on a fix though, sure it sucks when it happens but it does not make the game not recommendable like a lot of people do. They're going to fix it.

PiozZ	Recommended	43.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PiozZ/	Awesome game. MHW has addicting game-play with a well implemented crafting system. Your character progression is achieved through your own ability getting better, learning the monsters, and upgrading your gear. This all makes for a very rewarding experience. The bad - Matchmaking and getting your friends to play with you is pretty clunky. I feel like this shouldn't be an issue in 2018, but for some reason it is.

PastaPillows	Recommended	123.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pasta_Pillows/	Quick reminder to everyone complaining about the server issues: the servers on the PS4 version are also pretty awful. Give it some time; this is the most accessible Monster Hunter title out there, and their servers are overloaded right now, as expected.As far as performance, you need a good rig to handle this game, no questions asked. That said, it of course still has its issues (lightning-based elemental particles seem to really cut into the framerate) but overall, I'm enjoying this port over the PS4 version.More on performance, I'm using a good rig (Nvidia GTX 1080, Intel i7 6700k processor, 16 GB of RAM) and this game runs at a consistent 60 frames a second almost all of the time. As I said above, lightning particles seem to dip the framerate and cause it to stutter upon contact. Aside from that, the load times are significantly improved over the PS4 version, so much so that I almost find it jarring at how fast it loads. I put this game on my SSD, and because of that, the load times are cut down to about 2 to 5 seconds, compared to the PS4's 30 to 60 second load times.As far as content itself, this Monster Hunter title has overall less monsters than previous entries to Monster Hunter, but that's also because they're likely having to remake assets and animations for this game, since it looks completely different than the other titles. Because of this, expect it to be somewhat shallow in comparison. Make no mistake, there are still plenty of monsters to fight however. Additionally, this port does not have the content that the Playstation 4 has *yet*. We're likely to get free DLC such as Deviljho and etc later on, but some crossover content present in the PS4 version might be missing (aka content such as the Horizon Zero Dawn content might make it over, it might not, we'll just have to wait and see).tl;dr: The game itself is very very good, although it's missing a notable amount of monsters from the previous titles. Performance is actually very good, *if* you have the hardware to handle it. There are still some strange things about the performance though, such as lightning particle effects causing the game to stutter.
Cheri	Not Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cherixberry/	The game design itself is great. Decent gameplay, good graphics, good story so far, amazing monster designs, really fun to play.Whoever is responsible for the servers and the idea for "If someone DC's for half a second, we should remove them from their party, force them to solo quests, and make it impossible to reconnect to their instance without completely restarting the game," needs to have an actual pile of feces dropped on their doorstep. If you have shotty internet, such as Spectrum, and your internet lags occasionally, or every ten minutes, the MH team has made it impossible to play the game. You'll start an instance, of which most are designed to be played with multiple people, and as soon as the internet hiccups, you get disconnected. There's no reconnect option. You can no longer call for help. If you were in a party, your party members disappear. Your instance outside of the dungeon is now screwed until you quit the entire game and restart it. You can't connect to matchmaking again, you can't connect to friends' servers, you can't even make a new one. This is the WORST setup for disconnects I have ever encountered in a game. It's doubly frustrating that even if you have a monster at low health with your group, if it disconnects, there's a chance the monster will glitch back to full health and you have to solo kill it, from scratch, without your friends, from FULL HP, with the time limit still running. Yeah, no. 0/10 would not recommend unless you're a severe masochist who enjoys wanting to pull their eyes out of their sockets on every simple level.
GonzoHerbz	Not Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073558813/	Great game, terrible port.  In its current state, I cannot recommend it.

Abysmal performance and lacklustre textures. All to spend 45 minutes with dodge, attack, dodge, attack, dodge, attack, chase halfway across the map, dodge, attack, dodge, attack, dodge, attack. Play Dragon's Dogma instead.
Cham?	Not Recommended	88.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JustCham/	Welll, it's got issues. That's for sure. I'm not particularly sure what Capcom was doing in the time between the console launch and the PC launch, but it couldn't have been optimization or any actual work porting. The core gameplay is there, and it's both fun for veterans and accessible for folks just coming into Monster Hunter. The biggest issue is virtually everything surrounding that, which poses a problem, as you might imagine. I want to believe it's going to be addressed via patches but it's pretty obvious that some of the issues are so glaring that Capcom neither wants nor cares to fix them.Audio is fine. Monster Hunter isn't exactly known for having amazing music, but you still get the odd tune or two that might stick in your head. Game has a lot of language options, which is nice if you'd like to play with Japanese VO while keeping English subtitles. Good luck using the ingame voice chat, though, because it's whisper quiet and there's no option to adjust it anywhere. Nice.Graphics are graphics, I guess. It's the prettiest Monster Hunter game, but considering that Monster Hunter is primarily a handheld franchise (with a lot of solid console games, though) don't expect it to be mindblowing. Something with the TAA causes a 1 frame motion blur that's pretty annoying, and that can be fixed by changing the anti-aliasing type to FXAA. There's no options for changing depth of field, and the game has an extremely annoying volumetric fog addiction that runs the performance up, so you might benefit from turning that off. When running in 60fps I notice a slight constant jitter on the player character while moving. Not sure what causes that.Networking is, frankly, an absolute mess and if Capcom had any dignity they'd be embarrassed. The online component is so clearly tailored for the console market's seemingly infantile understanding of how lobbies and the like work, and it's not even functional half the time. If you want to play with friends, expect to have to restart the game until it decides to list their name in your online session list. After that, get ready to go into any story quest, watch all the cutscenes, and then back out to the lobby just so they can join you. If that sounds great, you're in for a treat, because once you're playing together there's no promise that the game won't just disconnect you all from one another and boot you back to the lobby in offline mode. Speaking of offline mode, there's no way to natively start in offline mode from the main menu, which worries me for when the servers go down. I can load up Portable 3rd or Freedom Unite from years ago and still play with friends using an adhoc server. Will I be able to say that about MHW?Overall, it's messy. The gameplay is really good, but there's just so much annoying stuff right now that I don't know if I can recommend it. It just seems like Capcom underestimated the size of the PC market and its anticipation of the game, because these aren't flaws that they could just let slide. If they aren't fixed in the coming weeks, the only message that it's going to send is that Capcom doesn't care about the PC market and just wants your money. I had decent hopes after the handling of the port of Dragon's Dogma, but it wasn't the same case for MHW.If they fix the issues, maybe I'd recommend it.

[RHFE] Zalanore	Recommended	85.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zalanore/	Having played many of the previous games I'd consider this more aking to Monster Hunter lite, but still a crazy enjoyable game. For those just entering the series it's the perfect game. I fully admit there were some excessively detailed and often bothersome mechanics in the previous games. I think this one over-simplifies many aspects to the point of being boring (like putting cool drink mushrooms at the entrance of every lava zone), but most of the ease of life changes are much appreciated (like not having to go to the wiki to look up monster weaknesses). Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Very enjoyable, but slightly too easy.

Ferengi	Recommended	31.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ferengi4/	As someone who is semi-new to the Monster Hunter universe but a veteran to PC ports and gaming alike, I'll say I am quite shocked on how many people dislike the port. The game runs perfectly for me at max settings with only a few FPS dips during "turf wars", and I assume I am just a weird person but I found the default bindings workable/good (Though I am only using the bow so prob. easier for me). I think there is a few settings I'd like to see added but nothing I can't manually disable via the files. (I think even motion blur is in there). I think the friend system is a bit wonky and I dislike not being able to share a hub with others but it's all minor things to a fun and exciting game.My PC:AMD 8300 FX OC to 4.1ghzGTX 1060 6gb (Boosted to 14gb)16GB of DDR38TB HDD/1TB SSDGame runs at about 200 FPS on average with slight dips to 60/45 FPS when too many bigger monsters are on the screen (I.E turf wars)

Jacket	Not Recommended	160.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049061553/	This is my first Monster Hunter experience, other than me playing the original on the PS2 emulator. I'll say, it's a very rewarding and fun experience, fighting gigantic monsters that only a genetically modified super-human can even attempt to fight. It cam take a long time to even complete one hunt, somtimes taking 30 minutes to finish. It is does take long, but it makes taking down that damn Diablos so much sweeter. I've been playing with some of my friends that are veterns of Monster Hunter and it's nice having the abiity to have an open ended hunt that anybody can join. With that said, I have many problems with this game. First of which is the optimization. With an Radeon RX 480 and an i7-4770, I should be able to run this game much better than the console port. I can't even get a solid 60 fps on 1080p at low settings. It runs like garbage. I normally end up playing in 1440p with medium settings with an average fps of 50-45. That's less than optimal if a PS4 can run it at around 30 fps. I believe this is so because they want "console parity", where the PC port matches as closely to the console version as they can. I don't know why they'd want that, but it's very stupid. The next issue is their multiplayer servers. Nothing is more frustrating when you're about to finish a hunt and your friend disconnects, leaving you with an extra tough monster thats been scaled up for having an extra player. It's a very common occurance that needs to be fixed. The last issue I have are the keyboard and mouse controls. I personally use a control for this type of game, but the PC controls still are relatively bad. The actual binding is mostly okay with almost everything able to be rebound, save for a few minor buttons. The big issue is the mouse, another thing affected by this so called "console parity". It doesn't actually control like a mouse, because it's emulating an analog stick, causing it to be very annoying to control. I thought it would help me with gunning, but it just doesn't control well enough. That would bring me to the end of my review. I would really like to recommend it, as it's very fun to play especially with friends. But I just can't with these underlying issues that should've been solved before launch. I'd wait until Capcom puts some more time into fixing the servers and adding more optimizations. TLDR Can be heavily enjoyed with friends and alone, but wait until they fix server issues and how well the game runs.
morninglurker	Not Recommended	96.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025709853/	as someone with 60+ hours in the game you'd think i'd reccomend it, and I love the gameplay! As a port it has the usual problems with optimization, controlls and UI, but none of those really stopped me from enjoying the game. You've probably read about the connection issues, which is one of those things that should never be an issue, but always is with a launch of a big name title, but the reason I cannot reccomend this game is because of the likelyhood that you will either not be able to play it regardless of your computer specs because of crashing, or lose significant progress because of crashing. ERR 12, graphics device drivers have crashed, I've spent a dozen hours troubleshooting this and despite how many other people are having the same issue I've not seen any official recognition of this particular issue, even though it's been over a week. What really gets me is that I have an RX570 as listed in the reccomended graphics cards, and I'm running the latest drivers that AMD have optimized for this particualr game, and though things were fine at first I can no longer play more than a few minutes before my drivers crash. TLDR; there are a lot of rough edges that you might expect from a port (though not one that had a delayed release specifically so it could be "optimized") but the game is still a great one, if it works for you, but don't think meeting the reccomended hardware means it will work at all. That seems to be up to luck more than anything. And don't think that the game working for 50 hours means it wont corrupt your save and/or start crashing every few minutes. Its just not stable.Wonderful game, broken software. I look foward to redacting this review in the future.

Watsu	Recommended	128.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/watsu/	I have around 500h (and the platinum trophy) in the PS4 version and the regular reviews talking how good this game is and how it's an amazing entry point for newcomers, so I'll focus on the PS4-to-PC experience:+ Most console ports are a bit lazy when they introduce mouse+keyboard inputs and MHW is NOT in that category. Menus can be navigated with your mouse and you can click everything, it's fantastic. There's also a new mmo-like item toolbar that helps mkb players even more.+ Even though my PC is under the minimum system requirements, I still decided to give it a shot. It actually runs pretty well, 30fps with a few stutters when there's too many particle effects on the screen, so I can't complain about the performance. + The new load times are fantastic. I spent hours watching the game load on the PS4 and now I can barely read the tips on the screen, I can get into quests in less than five seconds.+/- The online system is the same as the PS4, so if you don't know the workarounds to play story quests (enter quest, watch cutscenes then tell your friends to join), you'll suffer a bit. Occasional disconnects happen when Steam hiccups, though. Not great, but so far it has happened to me only once. The upside is that it's easier than ever to join your friend's sessions and guilds are now Steam Groups, so joining other people is easier than ever. On PS4 I had to message my friends and make sure everyone is in the same page before playing, on PC I can just hop on a lobby and do some quests with people on my friend's list.I still strongly recommend the game. Despite the online interface and some menus being still a bit below the industry standard for online play, this is still a fantastic game with hundreds of hours of content. Happy hunting!

BoogtehWoog	Recommended	105.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BoogtehWoog/	This is my first Monster Hunter game. I was incredibly wary of it given all the things I heard about grinding as I am generally very anti-grind. Despite these reservations, I just could not hold back and had to buy to the game. And I am so, so glad that I did. It has been an utterly superb experience. I've sunk almost 60 hours into it by the point of this review and I'm still jonesing for more. It is rare for me to be able to get 20-30 hours out of a game before I get bored. I've still got so much more content to go and I'm really excited to see it still.The gameplay is really fantastic. It is weird at first, especially the combat can seem clunky, but it really isn't once you start to figure it out and learn the ins and outs of fighting the monsters. It becomes second nature and just a great deal of fun. And with there being so many play styles due to the varied nature of weapons in the game, you've got a lot mileage with regards to finding a weapon style you'll like and also being able to just vary things up if you get bored with any specific weapon style. Outside of the weapons, there's so much you can do to use the environment to your benefit with fighting the monsters. There's just an impressive amount of interaction that lets you really control the flow of combat if you just take the time to study the world around you and use it.Visually, the game is stunning. The characters are amazing. I just cannot get over how good they look. The world itself is nice, colorful, and visually intriguing. There's a lot going on around you and it really lends a sense of a living, breathing world.The story is fairly barebones, but it is delivered well enough and it is charming in its own regard. I wouldn't go into this expecting some grandiose plot that will hook you. It just mainly serves to pull you into hunts. Despite that, it is just a very charming little world they've crafted here. I like the Monster Hunter world. It is almost comforting in some ways. I deal with a lot of depression and anxiety and the game helps to put my mind at ease when I can't do it on my own.Ultimately, I love this game and I think everyone should experience it. It is very much worth a shot!
ShitsWhenGiggles	Recommended	237.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mebaby2/	In monster hunter world you hunt monsters all for the goal of making pretty hats and shoes :DNot a big reviewer but just giving it a thumbs up its and aquired taste.
Joe	Recommended	73.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137899636/	From my understanding, most of the negative reviews are from it's un-reliable servers and unskippable cutscenes - and difficulty/grinding. There's tons of gameplay avaliable to watch from the console versions, so you should know exactly what you're getting into before you buy it - a difficult game about hunting monsters.No, it doesn't have perfect servers at pc launch. Yes, me and my friends disconnect from the server about 20% of the quests we go on together. Other than that though, it's a beautiful, complete game that is wonderous whether played solo or as a party. If you've played monster hunter before, it's like monster hunter plus warframe with quality graphics. If you've never played a mh before and want to know what you're getting into, think dark souls 3 mechanics with the option to grind if you're not strong enough.Done in a fashion similar to warframe, the quest system allows story and optional quests to be done alone or as a party, and scales in difficulty accordingly. Higher-ranked players can help other players do their quests, but low-leveled players cannot join high-tier quests. Pretty logical in my oppinion. Yes, the cutscenes are unskippable, but after the first few introductory ones, they become much shorter and less frequent.My main gripe is your "assistant" in the game. She's just an annoying character that tells you the most obvious things (such as 'roll to avoide attacks!' after you've been hit) and doesn't do much except talk. Other than that, the story is decent, the progression system works great, and the complex upgrading paths for all the equipment are eased in gradually as the story goes, on rather than shoving it down the player's throat right away.Areas- the first "half" of the game is played in 4 areas. It took me around 30 hours to finish the first part of the story, so that's 30 hours in the same 4 areas. I actually found this benifiting both the setting and the gameplay, as it allows you to gain a better understanding of the enviroment and learn which areas are the best for fighting which monsters, like a hunter bringing back materials from the same place should. The areas are large enough to have versatile enviroments inside each one (the 'desert' place has  a small forest, a swamp, and a 2-story desert in the one zone), so it doesn't really get stale and there's always more to learn next time you go back.Loadtimes - there are none. If you enter an area, there's no load time till you leave, nor is there any saving. This is different from the other monster hunter games where you could just cheese by the edge of the 'room' so you could run as soon as you needed to, because there are no rooms. The entire area is one open map, filled with an assortment of monsters unique to each area, so you can follow the tracks of multiple monsters at once across the map, just like how they can follow you until they get bored. What if I don't want to fight monsters? - Why are you even playing the game. Regardless, you can go fishing (with half decent mechanics), steal monster eggs, go around harvesting/mining resources, craft cool gadgets and potions, and catch monsters with traps. And you can get an item called blast nut. 10/10 game just for that if you ask me.The only real negative is the un-reliable servers, everything else is exactly as advertised and shown in console gameplay.My one suggestion if you do pick up this game is to do your weapon research. Find the weapon you like, look into all the tricks and tips for it. You start the game with one of every weapon, so there's no harm trying out a couple that seem appealing - I play hunting horn and it's a ton of fun for me, but if I hadn't looked into how it works, I'd feel so lost.If you like hunting monsters with cool weapons, great. That's everything this game is about. If you like cats, buy this game. If you like easy games, despise grinding, or don't want to fight monsters, why are you even here..?
Heatherlands	Recommended	81.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Heatherlands/	Absolutely worth the wait. Yes, it has it's start up problems, this is the first time they're going PC port, so I'm not judging. I have all the confidence all problems will be fixed soon or atleast over time. The world looks so much more amazing on PC than PS4. The details, the monsters, the added content over time, the frame rates. They're really going all out on this. It's amazing to see how much this game has grown over time. It's not going to be for everyone, but it's a great game, a great addition to the series, and I'm enjoying it alot.

The game lacks a lot of things that any PC game should really have by now, especially considering they had six months to make the port.Wait a bit if you're skeptical, but if you're willing to buy and look past the issues, you'll be in for quite the experience.

Dadswick	Recommended	135.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrBrunswick/	Monster Hunter.... holy hell. So, this is my introduction into the series. Ive never played a single one before now, and I was unsure about it when I first got it. When I started playing, I was instantly struck by how GORGEOUS the game is. The looks and sounds are so on point, and certainly memorable. I enjoyed everything from the first cutscene, and on. The story is somewhat shallow, unless you have followed the series beforehand - but as someone who loves deep stories, this didnt bother me at all.I know this is SO overused, but I have to say it - the combat in terms of limitations and movesets is very DarkSouls. You have to time your moves properly otherwise you can wind up leaving yourself wide open for attacks. Every encounter feels badass, and full of excitement. The mounting system is absolutely awesome, and the dynamics with crafting are pretty sweet.My only real complaints with the game is more so [ I believe] to be on Steams behalf - disconnection. I disconnect so much from other players in multiplayer so often... I know it will be fixed, so I dont let it bother me, but it can get really overwhelming when you face a Monster buffed for CooP by yourself.All in all, I seriously reccomend this game if you enjoy adventure, crafting, varied battles, replayability, and general mayhem. I am stoked about this title, and honestly can say I really hope for more.
Taki	Recommended	200.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Taki_Schnolf/	I have been playing monster hunter since the very beginning. I also previously got this on console when it came out. While it is sometimes frustrating to not be able to play with friends consistantly the game is still very well put together and very enjoyable to play again. While I do hope that they get the multiplayer fixed soon it still is easy enough to play solo.Pros:- fluid controls- short loading screens- in depth customization- beautiful level design- very rewarding gameplay- most important of all Palico'sCons- multiplayer connectivity spotty- optimization could be better- possibility of breaking a computer because of some fights.-squads were removed from this version.Now would I recommend this? The answer is yes, however, if you are wanting to play this game with friends constantly I'd say to wait till multiplayer is fixed first.Update: The capcom team is working to fix the connection issues. This is still following the same trend as far as how long it took to iron out the connection on console so it is not a big deal. They are listening to feedback and doing something about it.

Docdic	Recommended	131.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Docdic/	After playing the older games (3u/4u/freedom) It's a breath of fresh air to the series. It takes the foundation of the older games and builds up on it. The maps are no longer broken up into separate sections that need their own load screen to enter. And all the weapons have been given brand new mechanics to them making them feel more diverse and deep. However with the changes to the game over previous titles it also lacks some of the longevity that titles like 4u and the new generations u have. By that I mean the amount of monster added to the game and the addition of G-rank. In world there is only 24 (about only 21 on pc currently) in the game, and more to come. While on the 3ds title there was 70. In the end world is a step in the right direction. However it's like your grandpa who went to walk up the stairs to go the bathroom but instead only make it 3/4 the way there and♥♥♥♥♥♥his pants instead. I would reccomend this game if you have never played a monster hunter game before and want to know what it's all about.

Ferengi	Recommended	31.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ferengi4/	As someone who is semi-new to the Monster Hunter universe but a veteran to PC ports and gaming alike, I'll say I am quite shocked on how many people dislike the port. The game runs perfectly for me at max settings with only a few FPS dips during "turf wars", and I assume I am just a weird person but I found the default bindings workable/good (Though I am only using the bow so prob. easier for me). I think there is a few settings I'd like to see added but nothing I can't manually disable via the files. (I think even motion blur is in there). I think the friend system is a bit wonky and I dislike not being able to share a hub with others but it's all minor things to a fun and exciting game.My PC:AMD 8300 FX OC to 4.1ghzGTX 1060 6gb (Boosted to 14gb)16GB of DDR38TB HDD/1TB SSDGame runs at about 200 FPS on average with slight dips to 60/45 FPS when too many bigger monsters are on the screen (I.E turf wars)

[RHFE] Zalanore	Recommended	85.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zalanore/	Having played many of the previous games I'd consider this more aking to Monster Hunter lite, but still a crazy enjoyable game. For those just entering the series it's the perfect game. I fully admit there were some excessively detailed and often bothersome mechanics in the previous games. I think this one over-simplifies many aspects to the point of being boring (like putting cool drink mushrooms at the entrance of every lava zone), but most of the ease of life changes are much appreciated (like not having to go to the wiki to look up monster weaknesses). Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Very enjoyable, but slightly too easy.

Jacket	Not Recommended	160.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049061553/	This is my first Monster Hunter experience, other than me playing the original on the PS2 emulator. I'll say, it's a very rewarding and fun experience, fighting gigantic monsters that only a genetically modified super-human can even attempt to fight. It cam take a long time to even complete one hunt, somtimes taking 30 minutes to finish. It is does take long, but it makes taking down that damn Diablos so much sweeter. I've been playing with some of my friends that are veterns of Monster Hunter and it's nice having the abiity to have an open ended hunt that anybody can join. With that said, I have many problems with this game. First of which is the optimization. With an Radeon RX 480 and an i7-4770, I should be able to run this game much better than the console port. I can't even get a solid 60 fps on 1080p at low settings. It runs like garbage. I normally end up playing in 1440p with medium settings with an average fps of 50-45. That's less than optimal if a PS4 can run it at around 30 fps. I believe this is so because they want "console parity", where the PC port matches as closely to the console version as they can. I don't know why they'd want that, but it's very stupid. The next issue is their multiplayer servers. Nothing is more frustrating when you're about to finish a hunt and your friend disconnects, leaving you with an extra tough monster thats been scaled up for having an extra player. It's a very common occurance that needs to be fixed. The last issue I have are the keyboard and mouse controls. I personally use a control for this type of game, but the PC controls still are relatively bad. The actual binding is mostly okay with almost everything able to be rebound, save for a few minor buttons. The big issue is the mouse, another thing affected by this so called "console parity". It doesn't actually control like a mouse, because it's emulating an analog stick, causing it to be very annoying to control. I thought it would help me with gunning, but it just doesn't control well enough. That would bring me to the end of my review. I would really like to recommend it, as it's very fun to play especially with friends. But I just can't with these underlying issues that should've been solved before launch. I'd wait until Capcom puts some more time into fixing the servers and adding more optimizations. TLDR Can be heavily enjoyed with friends and alone, but wait until they fix server issues and how well the game runs.
.403. Starbuck	Recommended	47.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Starbuck_27/	The game itself is beautiful, challenging, and fun. Each quest makes you really work for a victory, and that makes it very rewarding. They implemented a pretty good tutorial system that teaches you as you go, and it has made it a lot easier for a new Monster Hunter player like me to get by and learn the game.There are a few network issues at this point in time; however, I have been able to work around it and still play with my friends fairly easy.
ThunderYamato	Recommended	95.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095092109/	Wonderful game if you've played the Monster Hunter franchise before. If you have not it can be a tough start. However if you take some time and try to get into the game and not complain about you not being able to kill every type of monster within the first 30min you will love it and will learn what it takes to become a good hunter.
WITNESS-ME	Recommended	269.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071968342/	Not going to lie lost track of the days while playing this game and racked 80 hours in 4 days, I see a lot of people giving it neg reviews over the smallest reasons look here's a list of some pills you gotta swallow. 1 - Gonna get this fat pill outa the way so listen Monster Hunter was never designed to be played with KB+M from the ground up it just isn't MH has always been that way years before the conception of PC MH was even a thing, HOWEVER that does not mean you cannot adapt to the controls scheme they already have. Instead of trying to change everything to fit you adapt to the games controls it'll happen eventually. A lot of people want to change them but they never try to just adapt to them like any games control scheme I can understand wanting to have some things be much easier to do but your fingers will learn and it won't be such a stiffiling experience then especially when you develop muscle memory.2 - On release the port was meh it did it's job and has it's functionality boom done (wording it for past tense because they're going to fix the PC port I don't see why they wouldn't but will change if they don't but even then it's really noothing to get bent out of shape for). Furthermore no PC port is ever perfect and this game isn't any different. The game IS NOT A BAD GAME by any means it's a a fantastic game with a meh port but can steam read that? No so you get thousands of neg reviews that pretty much are boggled down to  - Lack of some visual options - Connection issuesPersonally not affected by Denuvo don't care about it, Visuals are pretty solid some textures don't look great but when 90% of what you do is fighting monsters you never really have time to notice or see the texture flaws especially since the camera itself isn't on top of your character and is decently far back for you not to notice but i'm assuming they'll be fixed if not like I said earlier you don't really notice or atleast I don't. Connection issues I've DC'd twice out of my 80 hours so far 1 DC per 40 hours pretty much, I played mostly solo and grouped with friends on occasion and popped some SOS flares every now and again.Personally as someone that's played previous MH titles this one sets itself a part is is a ton of fun to have, the game will be fixed it's only been 4 days since release at the time of making this review. In my opinion most of the neg reviews are people getting bent out of shape over multiplayer like they're not going to fix it.........well ofc they are going to fix it why wouldn't they. Would I reccommend this game? Well my play time speaks for itself. If you wouldn't enjoy jumping onto a dragons back stabing it's eyes in and then taking your massive Great Sword and slamming it and ripping it out of it's face causing it to fall out of the sky to your fellow hunters or maybe you enjoy a much more lucrative approach setting traps poisoning the monsters favourite meat with various types of ailments. What ever kind of playstyle you want to go for in this game, it has you covered.

nastine	Not Recommended	312.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nathanaelayeh/	How Capcom managed to ruin a perfectly good game with a horrendous multiplayer system is beyond me. I have more than a 100 hours clocked in and I've lost count of the times I got disconnected from various sessions, including my own. Either my teammates get disconnected or I get disconnected. The major problem with this is that the difficulty scales up for multiplayer gameplay and it does not revert when players get disconnected, Which means that you'll have to fight in place of four people. (I can see that the difficulty doesn't scale back because it can be easily abused but it becomes tedious when you get dc every 5 mins)The online user interface is also a joke. It is mediocre at best. You can easily tell that who ever came up with this design is trying to be a special snowflake. What is the point of coming up with a complex multiplayer system if 100% of your audience has to go through a tutorial in order to understand how it works? Now that i've got the ugly stuff out of the way, here are the pros-1. Progression is well implemented to the point where even the most smallest upgrade can make your previous gear look like yesterday's leftover pizza.2. Every fight feels like a real hunt, even the smaller creatures are fun to track down.3. The weapon diversity alone compliments the different ways in which you can build your character and change your playstyle. (seriously, tons of weapons to choose from)That being said, if you enjoy the single player experience then go ahead, pick this up. However, if you're expecting a smooth multiplayer experience, be prepared to be dissapointed. 10/10 for gameplay-10/10 for a meaningless and lacklusture coop experience.(Don't get your hopes up, Capcom did not give two flying F*cks about the Street fighter V server issues. They probably don't care about this as well)
Dark Ranger	Recommended	135.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRanger57/	I'm one of the lucky ones who hasn't had any problems with performance. However, I am not lucky enough to be able to dodge the bullet that is this game's wacky ♥♥♥♥ing servers. It is borderline impossible playing this game multiplayer most of the time because of how spotty the servers are. It's a huge shame considering how co-op focused this game is.  If you're on the fence about buying this, I'd definitely wait until the performance and server issues are fixed. However, I've been having a blast with this game solo. This is my first real experience with Monster Hunter and I've not been disappointed thus far. There's a lot of depth to this game. Yes, it can be very confusing. Yes, it's grindy, as Monster Hunter has always been, but the experience you get from actually participating in hunts pretty much negates the tediousness of any of these factors. It all comes down to the monster hunting, obviously. It's split into a couple of phases. First, you have the prep phase. This occurs in the town hub where you pick up the quest, upgrade your weapons, buy supplies, eat food for certain buffs, etc.Once that's done, you depart on your quest and move to the hunting phase. The hunts themselves are paced really well in order to give you plenty of action while also allowing you to recuperate and regroup as the hunt moves from section to section. During this phase you usually have a time limit of 50 minutes, but it can be lower depending on quest modifiers. Once your prey has been hunted, you enter the final phase of the hunt, the looting phase. You have 60 seconds to carve up the monster for any loot you can find, as well as picking up anything else you might want from the environment. After the timer is up, you're teleported back to HQ to repeat the process. The most rewarding thing about this whole process is once you start to learn monster patterns and behaviors, you can start applying that knowledge to both prep accordingly and exploit patterns and behaviors of the monster. Eventually you start taking down the monsters faster and more effeciently. It's an RPG where you, the player, start to feel like a more experienced hunter as your character progressees.The game allows you to pick from 14 different weapons as well, each accomodating to a different playstyle with unique combos and upgrade trees. I hear the game's combat often compared to Dark Souls, but I feel like it's a little Dark Souls mixed with a fighting game. Using the right combos at the right time is key. Add the player's wide arsenal with the diversity of the many monsters in the game, and you have a very challenging and engaging combat system that's up to the task of keeping you interested well past the 100 hour mark. It's also important to note that while this game is great solo, it truly shines when you're playing co-op with a team. Difficulty scales with how many players are in your party, so coordinating with your friends to take down a monster as effeciently as possible adds even more depth to this already endless pit of a game. However, this game does some very strange things with multiplayer. If you and your friends are on the same quest in the story, the game simply won't let you depart on that quest together, telling you that you're not far enough in the story to join them. Good luck even getting into a session with your friends, though, considering how trash the servers are right now.  Overall, I'd recommend this game. As I said, if you're on the fence, just wait until all the server and performance issues are sorted out. This is a game that really shines when you're teaming up with your friends, but as of right now that's not very reliable.
Viridium	Not Recommended	213.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026651982/	Is this core gameplay enjoyable: Yes.Is the port enjoyable: Sadly not.This port is so ridden with serious bugs and massive oversights it kills a lot of the fun of the game. You gotta ask: What did they do the half year it took to port this for the PC? Especially the horrible implementation of multiplayer makes coop more of an annoyance than fun.Bugs:- Game can only be played with some specific settíngs e.g. only runs in borderless windowed othewise it has massive graphic glitche/isn't playable for me.- Good friend can't play at all because of Blue Screens with an even better PC than mine.- Weekly quests reset after each relog, making it nearly impossible to finish them.Horrible design:- Mouse has no DPI or sensitivity settings and uses one of the most annoying accelaration models I have ever seen.- Multiplayer feels as tedious as a game that came out 1995 and not 2018. You need to jump through several hoops just to play with friends. Why can't you join some quests at all? Why some only after playing the first minutes of a mission? Why can't you declare a party and do everything together like in every game since 2003?- Graphic settings are extremely limited. FOV can't be changed, motion blur and several other stable settings for PC can't be changed at all despite beeing used ingame. Some settings annoy me visually and I can't get rid of them, some other cost unreasonable amounts of GPU power and reducing overall performance with no way to turn them of to improve the performance.Especially the horrible multiplayer implementation makes this game feel like you play an old game on an playsation emulator and not a 60 buck title on PC.Can't recommend it with major overhaul of multiplayer, improved graphic settings and bug fixes.
FiNiX	Recommended	119.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092054450/	Yeah, I gotta think it's time for a review for this game. Why are there so much negative reviews? I just have to do something for this game. This game is awesome, sure it's not so good compared to the other monster hunter games and doesn't have that much content yet but it still has enough. I don't know why people are complaining about crashes, I had like one after 100 h, that happens man, get over it and i lost maybe two or three times my internet connection. Compared to the internet connection on the DS this game feels just like heaven to me. I dont know what you do but I want to support CAPCOM and my favorite game series.

Honestly I'd say just play one of the other MH games if you are looking for actual content.

It may be finished, but it certainly isn't working. All 7 hours I've played I was only able to play with friends twice for 2 hunts. The rest of the time it's session errors or failures to connect. Capcom really screwed up the multiplayer here. Then when and if it does work it lags beyond being able to be useful at all. It's all a grind as well. Here's a killquest to do a thing so that our people can do their thing for story advancment that you dont get to see. Just focus on killing the same monsters in the same areas several times. Dont worry about capturing them because it doesn't work unless you get that 1% chance that you hit the perfect little spot to knock it out. The only good thing about this game are the Palicos, they're cute and more helpful than anything else I've seen in this game. Than you Palicos.

[RHFE] Zalanore	Recommended	85.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zalanore/	Having played many of the previous games I'd consider this more aking to Monster Hunter lite, but still a crazy enjoyable game. For those just entering the series it's the perfect game. I fully admit there were some excessively detailed and often bothersome mechanics in the previous games. I think this one over-simplifies many aspects to the point of being boring (like putting cool drink mushrooms at the entrance of every lava zone), but most of the ease of life changes are much appreciated (like not having to go to the wiki to look up monster weaknesses). Overall I'd give it an 8/10. Very enjoyable, but slightly too easy.

I can literally say that Monster Hunter accompanied my entire childhood. I have put almost 500hours into MHW on PS4 already and here comes the Steam version! This is a great step for MH series to actually land on PC platform. Gotta say a HUGE thank you to Capcom for making this decision. Despite the 50152-MW1 network connection error (they are investigating this issue already), which can lead to random disconnect while playing with friends, I gotta say that I enjoy every second of the game. The juicy parts of MH from its previous versions have been well executed and carried on into this current version. Let the hunt begin!

MaskedMouse	Recommended	125.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027662208/	Fun and addicting game. Recommended to play together with friends and do the story solo!Pros:- Feels like an adventure!- Fun to farm, doesn't feel like a chore- Moderate / good difficulty scaling, sometimes difficulty spikes- Feels like an achievement hunting the more difficult monsters successfully- Good intro / tutorial information- Fun to play with friends, advisable to play the storyline solo- Overall a good port, had no crashes whatsoever. No memory leaks.- Can be played casually and hardcore!Cons:- Settings require a little tweaking so that the FPS doesn't drop. Audio to surround sound and headset.Personal opinion Cons:- Somewhat limited character creation customization, a lot of options feel the same. Couldn't really find a face for the character that I liked.- Max 4 player co-op, sometimes we have 5 players meaning someone has to sit one out. Would've liked to see bigger maps for 5 or 6 players. But I can understand for performance and balance that 4 is a maximum.- Server issues at release, but they're working on a fix! It made me fail a hunt somewhere at the beginning of the game. Also occured just about starting an arena quest with friends, we got seperated from eachother at the start due to this issue. Had quite a difficult fight alone.- Rewards for investigation quests feel a bit off. 10k for an easy vespoid quest that takes 3 min, compared to a hunt quest that gives the same amount but takes a lot longer to complete, like 15~30 minutes. When the quest is done with multiple ppl it splits the money reward making the quest reward even less attractive. Some quests have low time and low reward whereas others have high time and high reward. Just feels off.- Constantly spams Steam Friends that they play the game, a bug that requires to be fixed soon.What I like about monster hunter world is that the farm required doesn't feel like a chore to do. It's actually fun to farm.It has moderate / good difficulty scaling, things feel like an achievement and not being all that easy to complete at times. Which is nice.It is sad to see ppl complaining about either Denuvo, FPS or Server issues.Denuvo doesn't kill performance of MHW, I don't even notice it is in there.FPS is fine as long as you tweak your settings, there are so many hardware configurations for PC that creating a setting that works for everyone is just difficult. I've set Volume Rendering Quality to variable, the overall suggestion is turning this off to increase performance. Yes the game is CPU intensive, got an i7 6700k @ 4.5 GHz overclocked to support it. Do I have FPS drops? pretty much none.Server issues are just starting issues, probably a too high load for the servers. They're working on a fix though, sure it sucks when it happens but it does not make the game not recommendable like a lot of people do. They're going to fix it.

Stray	Not Recommended	184.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StrayXL/	Though i'm not having the performance issue other people are having, but alot of people are putting it on Volumetric Fog which makes sense because that is a power setting and for some reason it's on high for alot of PCs that cant handle it.I find it fun, but kinda frustrating because sometimes AI can break sometimes and act extermly unpredictably and i killed Anjanath first try without very strong gear, but got carted twice because he Roared then 1 Shot me with a fire attack while i couldn't react because of the Roar stun.I wish there was more then Recommend or Don't Recommend. If you can run it in the 2 hour time you can for refunds give it a try.If you want to play Online don't play it because it's extermly broken right now it's slowly getting more stable but it's still constantly breaking down.If you want to hunt monsters i would recommend just don't expect AI to be as realiable to react too.However if you expect to have varity of Keybinds you are out of luck alot of buttons/binds are double and can't be seperated or bound to multiple keys, but you have a general keys, melee keys, and ranged keys so you can have them set to how you want such as Moving Aim to your right click instead of CRTL.however General will conflict with it's self such as using Radial Menu, C is how you use things in the Menu but it's also puts you into Slinger Toggle so new players trying to use the radial menu might get confused or think they are bugged when they can't use their actual weapons.Also the Radial Menu DOESN'T ACTUALLY REALLY SUPPORT KEYBOARD AND MOUSE you can only use UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT There is NO-HOTBAR you can't have potions and items set to your number key for easy access because they did not put support into it, you can set it keyboard mode but then it just wont even exist anymore*Correction there is one for Keyboard, but it works like you are going through menus so you have to press the button for the menu, then the button that corresponds with the item, the game does not default to this if you don't even plug a game pad in it will always be in gamepad mode*Lock-On is also not a Lock-On it's just keeps your Camera aimmed at the target but your character themselves will not be locked on to the Monster so you can just end up swinging in the wrong direction It's a very questionable port though i am having Fun playing by myself sometimes i want to hunt with other people just to make getting resources faster but seeing how people you can DC any moment doesn't make that seem likely.All these issues makes it hard for me to recommend the game for anyone espiecally when i'm enjoying it, because alot of issues the game has

morninglurker	Not Recommended	96.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025709853/	as someone with 60+ hours in the game you'd think i'd reccomend it, and I love the gameplay! As a port it has the usual problems with optimization, controlls and UI, but none of those really stopped me from enjoying the game. You've probably read about the connection issues, which is one of those things that should never be an issue, but always is with a launch of a big name title, but the reason I cannot reccomend this game is because of the likelyhood that you will either not be able to play it regardless of your computer specs because of crashing, or lose significant progress because of crashing. ERR 12, graphics device drivers have crashed, I've spent a dozen hours troubleshooting this and despite how many other people are having the same issue I've not seen any official recognition of this particular issue, even though it's been over a week. What really gets me is that I have an RX570 as listed in the reccomended graphics cards, and I'm running the latest drivers that AMD have optimized for this particualr game, and though things were fine at first I can no longer play more than a few minutes before my drivers crash. TLDR; there are a lot of rough edges that you might expect from a port (though not one that had a delayed release specifically so it could be "optimized") but the game is still a great one, if it works for you, but don't think meeting the reccomended hardware means it will work at all. That seems to be up to luck more than anything. And don't think that the game working for 50 hours means it wont corrupt your save and/or start crashing every few minutes. Its just not stable.Wonderful game, broken software. I look foward to redacting this review in the future.

Necrochild	Not Recommended	280.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Necrochild/	Don't get me wrong, the game is a lot of fun, and I can see myself playing this for many many hours - but there are glaring issues that keep me from recommending it at a $60 price tag.Control options are telling of a "lazy port", you're basically just assigning keyboard keys to gamepad button functions from the consoles, and there is incredibly little in the ways of customization. This means if on console "Triangle" controlled four to five different things based on situation, mapping that function to E will control four to five different things based on situation, with no way to split the functions. You're going to be gathering items with the secondary attack button when your weapon is sheathed and there's no way to change it. The mouse look feels more like it's emulating a control stick.The online system is wonky and unintuitive, as I gather this is how the game is set up on console too, so this is a design choice, and a poor one. You can't join people doing the story until they've seen every cutscene in a particular hunt, even if you're at the same point in the story, which makes progressing together, something that you take for granted in other games, a massive pain in the backside. This is reminiscent of some early 2000s crap that leaves you scratching your head that a big budget title could go this direction for something that has "World" in the title.There are connectivity issues that seem to be more of a client issue than a server issue. People who have problems consistently have problems with disconnects and such, and people who do not have problems seem to never have problems (thankfully I'm one of the ones who do not have problems, about half of my buddies in discord get disconnected all of the time though).There is also some pretty sketch performance issues with graphics cards that don't appear to be an issue with "potato PCs" as some may call it, rather very fincky driver version needs - and some Nvidia driver versions (notably the most current one) causing two of my friends to crash during cutscenes (which are unskippable, by the way).Overall this game is rich in quality content, but you may have to break through a thick shell of frustration to get to it. There are guides out there if you go digging in Reddit and such to help you out, but you should not have to go digging for guides to get basic features that we normally take for granted to work for a full priced 60 dollar title.
Q-['-'Q]	Recommended	88.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hans3lg/	Lately, I've been frikkin angry with Capcom with how they've messed up with some of my franchises like Street Fighter  and Puzzle Fighter, as well as their decision to release MH XX for more than a year to the west. I was sceptical when they first announced MHW back in e3 2017 and I was like "Really? A MH with realistic current-gen graphics?"... But when it finally came to PC and played, it gave me a nasty surprise...To put it simply, MHW is far more complicated than its predecesors but it's more user-friendly and more comfortable to play. The map now feels like an open world ish unlike area-based environment like it was, where the system needs to go into 3 seconds loading if the hunter moves into a new area. But when I say it's more complicated, I'm talking about the map design here; each map has different levels of ground, meaning roughly 1F to 3F you can access, also there are plenty of grounds to climb, more caves, as a result plenty of navigation to the map. Well that's one hell of a way to get lost rite? Not exactly... The scoutflies are there to help you, they're green glowing flies that guide you into your quest objective, several interactible objects, and also waypoint you put when you're accessing the world map and it just works like your personal GPS actually. The only problem for me at some quests is when I'm trying to find the large monster I needed to hunt. Because the world is larger, Capcom decided to make large monsters to leave tracks so that hunters can easily find them such as footprints, skids, etc. But unless I find one of them around, I need to travel around the big map until I find one unless I open up some online guides on where does the particular monster spawns.The soundtrack is just simply outstanding, when you're fighting against a monster, the music just fits perfectly on how tense your battle is. When the monster is fleeing and you're chasing after it, the music also adapts into it, fiting into the atmosphere and flow of your game. The village theme in this game also simply become my favourite of the series, next to MH2 and MH4.But that's just not the main point that completely sold me into the game here. Capcom completely overhauled the gameplay experience to make the game very comfortable to play. For instance the gathering mecanisms: hunters now instantly grabs herbs, mushrooms, or bugs instead of 3 seconds of animation per grab. Carving, bone gathering, and mining also alot faster, and on top of all, you can just hold the action button to gather until its resource vein completely drains out which makes gathering jobs a lot faster and ease which kept me wondering why only now these mechanisms are implemented because I was frustrated enough about gathering in previous monster hunter games.I used to search for online guides everytime I play previous Monster Hunter series because the game just simply not straight-forward. I need to research myself for the game mechanisms, monsters behavior, as well as guides and tips. But in MHW, the tutorials are way more sophisticated. There are also Research Center in this game; in short, every monsters has its own research levels which if you level it up, your hunter guide's information regarding to particular monsters will grow. It'll display their weaknesses, breakable parts, even dropped items.Potion drinking is a lot more risky; the hunter will start drinking potion immediately with a white bar in your HP gauge starting to regenerate into actual green bar (a.k.a your real HP). This process can either be cancelled by rolling or getting attacked by a monster. If this happens, the healing process will stop and your potion will still be consumed. The great news is, you can still move (or even run) at a slower pace will consuming. Which means, overall consumables became easier but at the same time risky if there are monsters around.Armor skills in this game are more variant than previous series. In the past, players need to have full set of armors in order to activate its armor skills. Here, each armor parts activates a skill. The difference are each skills have wider amount of levels which means if any other source of armor skills stacks the same skill it will level up, also some sets have unique armor skill bonuses if wielded with a full set.The UI in this game provides more information as well. For the first time, players will be able to see damage indicator presented as numbers. The damage indicator will be white color if you hit fortified part of the monsters, while it will be red if you hit their weaknesses. Also with these numbers, hunters will know exactly how damaging each weapon classes differ. Another example of UI tweak is monster's heart rate. While this is not straight-forward, the heart-rate monitor tells you about the monster's state. While enraged, heart rate will increase and sometimes turn into orange ish instead of blue. While exhausted, heart rate will slow down; while weaken, the heart pulse will be smaller than usual.Well, moving on into my cons for this game, first of all the launch isn't that smooth. Multiplayer as for now isn't playable due to server issues, perhaps because players are too hyped, the game's player count reaches above 200.000 which may explain the server is overloaded. I tried to play multiplayer with my friend and unfortunately, it's like almost guaranteed that each of us will be disconnected one by one in the middle of battle. Also when I'm in the game (whether in quests or menu), I often auto-disconnect from the server and I needed to re-connect into the server again, so for now the game is best played offline.Another issue is the system requirements. This game is very demanding that even some high-end PC's won't run well here. I'm running at GTX 970M and I needed to set graphical elements from mid to low setting in 1080p. The explainatory doesn't end there, my GPU is overclocked and it still runs at 50-65 fps range. It's not smooth 60 fps but it's definitely smooth enough and playable. I read that not even the powerful GTX1070 be able to run the game at highest settings in steady 60FPS @1080p. Wow...In conclusion, this is a blast for me.

Happle	Not Recommended	266.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nogaem/	The game itself is great, but there's a myriad of issues going on ever since the release on PC.The good news is that it's finally on PC, and it's pretty well optimized. The gameplay is the same as the older ones in the franchise, but with a few changes here and there (both minor and major ones). The most noticable difference would be the consumables, as you can move while using them. This allows the game to be a bit more fast-paced, though I miss the comedical poses you do after downing a potion or a well-done steak.And here comes the bad news:The multiplayer is a disaster, as the frequent disconnections makes it more frustrating than enjoyable to play with friends. It also contributes to the constant pop-ups about that your friends are playing the game every 3-5 minutes since it "restarts" their online status while playing the game, even if they've been playing for hours in one go. I'm suspecting Denuvo to be the reason for the multiplayer issues, as I've had similar problems with other online games utilizing this DRM.Some of the menus aren't very well-made for mouse controls (weapon upgrade menu being the biggest offender), and you can't split up the multi-action keybinds into separate keys.All in all, wait for them to fix the biggest issues before buying. Especially the multiplayer problem if you want to play with your friends.

Spacehamster	Recommended	27.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049934592/	Hi there,I just wanted to say that the 42% mixed review is overexaggerated and mostly based on frustration.After 5+ hours (single player) playtime I can say this is a nice game, how nice I'll still have to discover. I have to get into the mechanics, especially the questing system. There are different quest priorities/game modes. Some have restrictions and some don't... I'll have to find out.Controls (console experience for me) are clumsy. Targeting a mob doesn't mean your character is faced towards it. You can easily attack the opposite direction. Targeting atm feels more like tracking your prey instead of facing it and use targeting during the battle effectively, oh well it's called Monster Hunter.The Monster fight durations are a mystery to me as well. There is no healthbar as an indicator, and they flee, many times (sometimes to places with additional enemies). Sometimes you see them fleeing crippled and you think 'yes it's almost down', but it still needs alot of hits (while it's still capable to hit you hard as well)... and then flees again.But 42% mixed reviews? Hell no, my rating would be 75% and probably raising while I progress into the game.

Shambler	Not Recommended	120.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckmyassnigga/	An incredibly fun game, possibly one of the best games I have ever played. I don't recommend getting it in its current state though. Disconnects from online sessions are pretty frequent. Poorly optimization is also a big issue. You'll get random frame drops when playing (don't even get me started on Kushala Daora). So to anyone eager to get this, please wait until the game gets patched.

With the occasional connection error (which has now been patched effectively) frustration would arise, having all your friends watch cutscenes separately before you can co-op story missions is a pain but this issue was already known on the consoles too and can be worked around relatively well.Apart from these minor issues, the game delivers everything you hope for. A slamming orchestral soundtrack blasting as you and friends, each equipped with one of the 14 different weapon types (which all deliver you a whole separate game experience), as you track and hunt enormous monsters within the New World. Having zero respawns left and coordinating with your friends as you work together tactically to mount and knock down the monster, just to have your friend with the big♥♥♥♥♥hammer pound the monster on it's head, it's moments like these which make this game such a beauty to play.If you can get a few hours into Monster Hunter: World, you'll be sucked in a universe where each monster kill will get more satisfying than the previous one.

Rai	Recommended	80.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ketsurou/	Monster Hunter, a series that I grew up with, that I've sunk thousands (plural) of hours into, and a series that I'll always love and respect, on PC. A dream come true at last. Add on to that the fact that this is the most welcoming Monster Hunter game of the series, and you've got this whole package.Now, let's get to the bad first, which is probably the main reason you're looking at reviews.As of today, 8/13, this port has a multitude of issues, mostly in Multiplayer. Fortunately, this game has a wonderful community with temporary fixes galore. The first being adding the following into your STEAM launcher options:-nofriendsui -udpYour "Target" should look similar to this:"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\Steam.exe" -nofriendsui -udpThis has fixed 99.9% of the multiplayer issues for me. However, that's not all the issues:-FPS issues, genrally fixed by turning Volumetric Rendering to OFF.-Heavy dips in certain fights and with lightning weapons, I believe caused by particle effects rendering separately instead of one entity.-Save corruption (as reported by a miniscule amount of people), caused by crashing during a save sequence.-The default keyboard controls are absolutely atrocious. You will NEED to rebind these if you plan on using KBM.-There are some issues with latest nVidia drivers (again, as of this writing), and you'll need to use old drivers.-This game features LESS monsters overall than other titles in the series.However, the game has plenty of pros as well:+This game is the most welcoming and smallest learning curve of ANY Monster Hunter game in the series.+The game is gorgeous. Hands down, the game is beautiful.+The game is a blast with friends!+The game has Poogie!+The weapons are diverse with deep skill ceilings for each of them.+The combat is engaging and fun.+Literally infinite playability!Monster Hunter is a series known to receive a plethorea of free updates over each title's lifetime. That speaks for itself!Overall, I'm thrilled Monster Hunter is finally on PC. If this is your first time treading the waters, expect to face off against some Monsters that will challenge your patience. Some of the fights are fierce and unforgiving. Others are far more easy on you, letting you ease your way up. The community is immaculate, and one of the best communities I've ever experienced in any game series.If you have any interest at all, even a small amount, I strongly recommend picking it up for at least the first major hunt. That'll leave your playtime under 2 hours. If you decide this isn't the right game for you, you can return it at that point.Overall, I'd give the game a solid 8/10. Minus two points for some admittedly severe port issues. Capcom has acknowledged these issues and is already working on a fix.Bottom line, this game is phenomenal. I'll be sinking several hundreds of hours into this game as I have the prior titles. Now if you'll excuse me, I need more jewels!

(can customize him too)-Seeing monsters engage with other monsters-Great soundtrack-Incredible, beautiful environments and monsters to fightCons:-Some graphics settings are iffy-Not the most up to date version but will be patched to it in time-Textures on armor sometimes seem to lack-Max 4 player co-op, sometimes we have 5 players meaning someone has to sit one out.

Q-['-'Q]	Recommended	88.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hans3lg/	Lately, I've been frikkin angry with Capcom with how they've messed up with some of my franchises like Street Fighter  and Puzzle Fighter, as well as their decision to release MH XX for more than a year to the west. I was sceptical when they first announced MHW back in e3 2017 and I was like "Really? A MH with realistic current-gen graphics?"... But when it finally came to PC and played, it gave me a nasty surprise...To put it simply, MHW is far more complicated than its predecesors but it's more user-friendly and more comfortable to play. The map now feels like an open world ish unlike area-based environment like it was, where the system needs to go into 3 seconds loading if the hunter moves into a new area. But when I say it's more complicated, I'm talking about the map design here; each map has different levels of ground, meaning roughly 1F to 3F you can access, also there are plenty of grounds to climb, more caves, as a result plenty of navigation to the map. Well that's one hell of a way to get lost rite? Not exactly... The scoutflies are there to help you, they're green glowing flies that guide you into your quest objective, several interactible objects, and also waypoint you put when you're accessing the world map and it just works like your personal GPS actually. The only problem for me at some quests is when I'm trying to find the large monster I needed to hunt. Because the world is larger, Capcom decided to make large monsters to leave tracks so that hunters can easily find them such as footprints, skids, etc. But unless I find one of them around, I need to travel around the big map until I find one unless I open up some online guides on where does the particular monster spawns.The soundtrack is just simply outstanding, when you're fighting against a monster, the music just fits perfectly on how tense your battle is. When the monster is fleeing and you're chasing after it, the music also adapts into it, fiting into the atmosphere and flow of your game. The village theme in this game also simply become my favourite of the series, next to MH2 and MH4.But that's just not the main point that completely sold me into the game here. Capcom completely overhauled the gameplay experience to make the game very comfortable to play. For instance the gathering mecanisms: hunters now instantly grabs herbs, mushrooms, or bugs instead of 3 seconds of animation per grab. Carving, bone gathering, and mining also alot faster, and on top of all, you can just hold the action button to gather until its resource vein completely drains out which makes gathering jobs a lot faster and ease which kept me wondering why only now these mechanisms are implemented because I was frustrated enough about gathering in previous monster hunter games.I used to search for online guides everytime I play previous Monster Hunter series because the game just simply not straight-forward. I need to research myself for the game mechanisms, monsters behavior, as well as guides and tips. But in MHW, the tutorials are way more sophisticated. There are also Research Center in this game; in short, every monsters has its own research levels which if you level it up, your hunter guide's information regarding to particular monsters will grow. It'll display their weaknesses, breakable parts, even dropped items.Potion drinking is a lot more risky; the hunter will start drinking potion immediately with a white bar in your HP gauge starting to regenerate into actual green bar (a.k.a your real HP). This process can either be cancelled by rolling or getting attacked by a monster. If this happens, the healing process will stop and your potion will still be consumed. The great news is, you can still move (or even run) at a slower pace will consuming. Which means, overall consumables became easier but at the same time risky if there are monsters around.Armor skills in this game are more variant than previous series. In the past, players need to have full set of armors in order to activate its armor skills. Here, each armor parts activates a skill. The difference are each skills have wider amount of levels which means if any other source of armor skills stacks the same skill it will level up, also some sets have unique armor skill bonuses if wielded with a full set.The UI in this game provides more information as well. For the first time, players will be able to see damage indicator presented as numbers. The damage indicator will be white color if you hit fortified part of the monsters, while it will be red if you hit their weaknesses. Also with these numbers, hunters will know exactly how damaging each weapon classes differ. Another example of UI tweak is monster's heart rate. While this is not straight-forward, the heart-rate monitor tells you about the monster's state. While enraged, heart rate will increase and sometimes turn into orange ish instead of blue. While exhausted, heart rate will slow down; while weaken, the heart pulse will be smaller than usual.Well, moving on into my cons for this game, first of all the launch isn't that smooth. Multiplayer as for now isn't playable due to server issues, perhaps because players are too hyped, the game's player count reaches above 200.000 which may explain the server is overloaded. I tried to play multiplayer with my friend and unfortunately, it's like almost guaranteed that each of us will be disconnected one by one in the middle of battle. Also when I'm in the game (whether in quests or menu), I often auto-disconnect from the server and I needed to re-connect into the server again, so for now the game is best played offline.Another issue is the system requirements. This game is very demanding that even some high-end PC's won't run well here. I'm running at GTX 970M and I needed to set graphical elements from mid to low setting in 1080p. The explainatory doesn't end there, my GPU is overclocked and it still runs at 50-65 fps range. It's not smooth 60 fps but it's definitely smooth enough and playable. I read that not even the powerful GTX1070 be able to run the game at highest settings in steady 60FPS @1080p. Wow...In conclusion, this is a blast for me. I'd give it 9/10 at the current state but if capcom manages to fix the multiplayers perfectly, this is an easy 10/10. This sequence is undoubtedly the best on the series by the massive jump in quality and content which has ever not seen before. Hands down into the biggest PC game Capcom launched in 2018 so far.So be warned, if your computer can run this game, you might consider throwing away your real social life :3

Steph	Recommended	205.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006979728/	So far, I do enjoy the game. The world is great and the monsters, even better. My issue comes from the co-op gaming. I strongly dislike the fact you cannot play the game through with someone in your party. All people must have watched all cutscenes to be able to proceed with quests together and I wish I had read more into detail about this before buying. It is tedious as heck to watch all cutscenes and abandon just to rejoin a mission so you can party with others... :|Between how poorly the co-op was setup and the connection issues it has been a bit disappointing but truthfully, the connection issues are to be expected when a new game launches. I really hope Capcom thinks on the co-op setup and adjusts it so people can watch the cutscenes and enter new quests together. I did list this as recommended due to the music, storyline, and detail. Single player is fine but it can be difficult to play alone.

Friend of Eegor	Not Recommended	45.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/marioboi/	The game itself is fantastic, finally we get to play an MH game on PC. However, the underlying issues with a very lazy port make this a very frustrating experience. - Very poorly optimized, the graphics are really nothing special (console parity) and yet it requires to have a top end gpu to even be able to sustain 60 fps during some boss fights.- A matchmaking system that was lifted straight out of a PSP, groups are useless and you have to copy session ID's (in 2018!!) to join your friends.- Emulated joystick for mouse input (input lag)- Random network disconnects that are preventing people from playing together.- Cannot skip cutscenes and unable to go an mission if someone of your group has not watched the cutscene.- Rotating menu cannot be used with M+K, this should take you about 10 mins into the game to figure it out and yet a QA team working on the game for 7 months could not pick it up.- Motion blur and depth of field cannot be disabled and eat up a lot of performance. You should not buy this game at retail price since it is dishonest to offer a gaming experience that is SUBPAR TO THE CONSOLES unless you have extremely high end hardware plus all the other issues that should have been ironed out in the 7 month time it took them to release this game. The port is just not what it needs to be and it feels like they barely put in any work and just hoped that people would accept any excuse since it the first MH game on PC.  
Loȝan Rooke	Not Recommended	56.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/losian/	The multiplayer aspect, plain and simple, needs to be tightened down. That's all there is to it.Invites often don't work, people get disconnected constantly, and just getting a quest started is an utter chore of tedious menu-navigation and screwing with settings and reconnecting and so forth.There's just no reason or excuse at all for these kinds of problems - it literally feels like 15-25% of playtime is just screwing with trying to get connected to a session, then join the quest, then get in the quest, then hope it doesn't disconnect (despite having no internet issues, it just likes to lose connection!). But oh, if you DO get disconnected, sucks to be you. The spot you were in is still "occupied" by an unnamed, non-existant player, and it won't let you rejoin for some reason? And if you then add an extra slot and try to rejoin then.. you may have waited too long and wont' get quest completion credit anymore.Not to mention numerous quests require you to pick up the quest solo with your buddy doing the same, walk into the quest, listen to some dumb cutscene, walk around some, see a big monster, leave the quest, RE-accept the quest, RE-start the quest, go out with your friend now actually in tow and THEN you get to play.It's the most awkward, needlessly convoluted and stupidly frustrating system of multiplayer I've ever seen. Just share cutscenes, it's 2018, we've been showing cutscenes to more than one player at a time for decades. There's also dozens of ways to not constantly have players disconnect from one another or, at least, be able to *re*join easily.The game was delayed heavily for PC, is full-price, and there's a whole plethora of previous titles to learn from. This is a solidly "don't bother" review just because the multiplayer is so uttelry frustrating to get working, and it loves to fail constantly when you do finally get it working. Some will say "oh well after the main story it works better" - that's not a valid justification to me at all. It's multiplayer, we've been doing this stuff since LAN-playing Doom, and I sure didn't get disconnected, booted, have invisible players occupying slots, etc. etc. happen there. It's not that hard, and all these games that do it so poorly just boggle my mind.tl;dr - It's a game that is designed around multiplayer, yet multiplayer is absurdly convoluted and unreliable to get working. If anything goes wrong, you are screwed with progress/can't rejoin.edit: Okay, even after the disconnects are improved by altering settings, and ignoring the fact that there are a dozen ways the disconnects could be mitigated (none of which MHW does - if you disconnect, you're screwed)  - I'm leaving this as a not-recommend because the design is just dumb half the time. The game actively prevents you from playing and enjoying it. Why must I join a mission, see some pointless cutscene, leave a mission, and THEN get ot play with someone sitting right beside me? Have we not figured out how to share cutscenes?Better yet, why do we need the cutscene?Spoiler, here is EVERY SINGLE MISSION in the game: STart mission, aimlessly wander until you find tracks, follow tracks to spot, see pointless cutscene where your dumb handler stands in the way of danger, narrowly shove her out of the way/avoid an attack from the foe (who you may have seen/tracked a dozen times prior, doesn't matter!), and then begin fight.It's the same, mission after mission, and it's just tedious. Wasting 15 minutes running around to find a monster I already know the lair of just to see a dumb cutscene that is the same as every other cutscene so I can leave the mission and THEN restart the quest with someone I am co-oping with.. it's just needless tedium and wasted time.When you get to the fun part of the game - fighting monsters - it's fun. But getting to that part is way too tedious, there's absolutely no need for so much of the aimless fiddling and issues in design to get in the way of an otherwise good game. But given the price, and the delay of time they had to make stuff work right (did nobody test their game on the steam servers if it's solely steams problem?) I don't really consider it acceptable - it's bad design choice.
Vaandill (Axon)	Not Recommended	47.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042678013/	If you have ever played monster hunter before you will be disapointed in this game. Monsters are slower, weaker, and have less health. Dispite having several games and a huge list of monsters and weapons in other games this one has the smallest weapon and monster list of all the the games. Also dispite the console version having more content that has been released the PC version has none of it, including a few bug fixes such as joining story quests. The overly complicated way of joining private sessions with your friends invloves using a long randomized password that needs to be put in every time the room is made, also while console users get several groups to join and do hunts with the PC users only get Steam Groups that lack the ease of joining with. The worst part about all of this is not being able to join quests with your friends if everyone has not seen the short movie, some quests have multiple of these and prevent friends from joining until all have been viewed, even the post kill video. For a game that has been historicly been about hunting with your friends World does everything it can to make that as challenging as possible by forcing everyone to play several hours of the game by themselves, and if they want to play with someone who is behind them in the main story they have to spend that time waiting for the other hunter to watch a movie before you can join them.As of writting the game still suffers major connection issues only making it harder to play with your friends, when the games allows you to do so.
Tuiat	Recommended	234.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tuiat/	No idea why people are hating on this. The port is just fine, And the game is incredible. Keyboard and mouse is honestly not recommended, and you're gonna have to deal with it. Monster Hunter has always been played with a controller/3DS. And it's better for it.62 hours in, And many more to come.
Oktar the Moneyless	Not Recommended	135.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dynasty624/	Absolutely amazing game. Combat feels good, music is great, looks really pretty (although hard to hit 60 fps with a higher end pc), so much fun to play with friends.... when possible.I'd love to give this game a glowing review and reee about how awesome it is from the roof tops, however theres one thing holding this game back IMO; the networking issues. Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥I just want to play with my friends and its nye on impossible without encountering some god forsaken networking problems with their garbage servers. But thats not all maybe I could just resign in and all will be well. Well I would if I could, but you have to exit the mission to relog into the online services. Please just fix the damn networking issues. I want to love your game but ffs, you make it so difficult.

George	Not Recommended	1.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dentedgod/	On console this may be a far better game but as it stands I can not recoomend it on PC bnecause MHW is a bad port. The controls are wonky and unresponsive. There are attacks that require you to hit both mouse buttons at the same time and it only registers both mouse buttons being hit about 1/6th of the time. To be sure it wasn't just me I went to the training area to test and absolutely confirmed it was not registering correctly, in fact it was missing many other key clicks. This is a major issue because you need to chain together attacks and breaking that chain leaves you open. Targetting is all over the place. Locking onto a monster will turn your camera the opposite way your character is facing but not turn your character, which is disorienting and clumsy.There are also far to many Cutscenes. In the first hour+ of play you will actually be controlling your character maybe 10-15 minutes. It got to the point where I was repeatedly saying "just shut up and let me play". I was willing to live with this until I finally got to try out weapons in the training area and go on the test mission and had the experience I mention above. The only posatives I experienced were The graphics are pretty and making my character was fun.This is the first game I felt I needed to warn people against. All of my other reviews have been posative until now. I've just stopped playing games that I didn't like.

Dongs.exe	Not Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043143194/	The little I played of single player seemed to work, but others have stated to have lots of issues there too. I have been lucky this far.But if you want this game for multiplayer? Don't. Not until they fix many issues. Everyone probably knows of the server issues by now, but the biggest issue of multiplayer is built into the game itself. If you wanted to hunt new monsters and go through the story with friends, you pretty much can't unless you jump through so many hoops that it's ridiculous. Everyone has to have seen all the cutscenes in a story mission to be able to join it, including finding the monster for the first time cutscene. Have fun running over to a monster, waiting for all your friends to do the same and then quit and start the quest for real with all of you together! And then get disconnected from the servers. Might not sound like much, but it adds up - oh does it ever. Some quests are even so full of cutscenes that you pretty much can't play with your friends who are at the same point. Old Monster Hunter games had separate offline and online campaigns with offline being the story and cutscenes, and with online lacking those features that might cause desyncs or something. When this one tried to mix them together, I assume all of us thought they'd be online and playable with your friends so you could enjoy it together. Nope, pretty much the exact opposite and there no longer is any proper online questline or progression, just online grinding for parts - at least not at low rank, but I wouldn't know what happens after the story quest as everyone who bought this to play together quit because they don't care to hunt alone, and neither do I, honestly. This was something no one mentioned anywhere and would have affected whether or not we would have purchased the game, so take note!Fixing the server issues will not fix this issue. The story should have been offline if it's something you have to solo or SOS randoms - which you shouldn't, as every hunter adds health to the monster and if the random hunters are bad, your fights just get longer and tougher than if you did them alone. And if you do somehow find cool hunters you'd like to continue hunting with, you really can't as you're separated after the quest without going to the same hub. And speaking of the hub, there's only one part of it that is multiplayer friendly with other players actually showing up, and no one really goes there. A big part of the multiplayer experience in past games of the series has been screwing around before and after the quests together when you're not on a hunt, so there's not really much of that left in World.I remember when the tagline of this series was "in the world of Monster Hunter, you're never alone". Well, I sure am more alone now than ever, even with the janky multiplayer of the old games.

I dragon man	Not Recommended	23.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/peashy/	Love monster hunter, i love this game, i plan to spend many hours on it, i dont reccomend you buy it.The reason?it runs like♥♥♥♥♥ this game is full force "runs fine on my machine" from its defense force, when you ask what kind of pc they use its almost always some kind of 6th to 8th generation intel i5 or i7 and either a 1070 or a 1080.Any game will run fine with that kind of pc, me personally still have a pretty high end rig, but because i have an old i5 (one that still punches pretty high for being 6 years old) a 3570k clocked at 4.8ghz, which is a 0.1% processor, very very few 3570ks clock this high, and that is the games bottleneck, your cpu, and for no real reason, i can turn every physics related option off and the game still pegs my cpu to 100%. and the telling thing is that the game runs exactly the same at the highest settings as it does the lowest, my 1% lows on both the high and low preset are 18 fps, my average on both is 44.And before anyone asks i have a 1070 clocked to 2125, and it never even clocks up that high when im playing, it stays are 1550@40% useage.Dont buy this game unless you dont mind god awful preformance or think the average person games on a 8700k and a 1080ti.

Lefein Noël	Recommended	93.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iloveyoupurples/	TL;DR: Controllers work fine. You just have to tinker with steam. There is no Motion Blur, turn off TAA and Volumetric Fog.If you see complaints about "Motion Blur and DoF" it's due to the reviewer not knowing what they're talking about. Feel free to laugh at them when you do the following:Turn off TAA. (Because there is no Motion Blur.) Turning off the Volumetric Fog also really sharpens the image.Also giggle about the fact the game has mixed reviews largly due to the fact that end users turn everything to highest without understanding what the settings actually do.This was a near perfect port, Enjoy, I'll see you on the hunt ♥!Game works fine. If your controller isn't working, brute force it through the Steam controller settings to override the binary scramble.Or find a tech support Discord server and have them explain it. I fixed mine in 4 minutes. With a decent gaming PC, on the highest settings @1440p I maintain 90FPS. (Turn TAA and Volumetric Fog OFF! It's hideous.)The game is bloody fantastic.

HellBlazer75	Recommended	3.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hellblazerbd/	Mᴏɴꜱᴛᴇʀ Hᴜɴᴛᴇʀ: WᴏʀʟᴅMost console player knows how good monster hunter world is. As the pc version just released yesterday I played for like 2.5 hours though spent most of the time creating the character. So here's a short review of the game (PC VER.).ρՐԾՏ:• Pc port performance is quite good.• Incredibly deep and rewarding gameplay.• Beautiful and varied world with so much varieties.• Each monster is different and requires knowledge about the monster to actually beat it in the proper way this gives a feel of a boss fight every time.• Story is moderately good and engaging. • The dense wildlife sounds are so good and many monsters can be identified through their cries, footsteps, and other audio intels.• Combat is great controls might need some tweaking but it's great and weapon types and list is massive and diverse.• Tons of customization also character creation is quite good. • Environmental hazards are something you always have to be careful about as nature can ruin your day beside monsters.• Food cooked by cat chefs what more do you want man :pς๏ภร::• Troublesome design with forced online interactivity.• lip sync is totally crap.• Multiplayer matches can be fiddly to set up.• The new verticality of levels occasionally leads to frustrating AI pathing glitches.• Denuvo DRM I simply can never make myself to like it.• Some notable problems [Motion Blur Depth of Field Bloom/Glow Effects Mouse Acceleration] no way to turn them off needs fixing.• Might face problem with controllers.In the End this game is a must buy for playing coops because coop is the heart of this game. If you love jrpg just buy it. A tip **Try turning off volumetric rendering for a significant fps boost**.  Getting 60fps@Gtx 970 1080p  !!Totally RECOMMENDED!!

HayoMayo	Not Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gayomayo/	The gameplay and visuals are great.The UI and Menu system is an awful mess.Partying up with friends is a nightmare to navigate, getting quests going, getting into eachother's expeditions is a 6-7 step process despite being in the exact same online session (which in itself is 4-5 step process) just flat out inviting someone to your game wont work. They have to go to a specific NPC to join your game despite the invite.I found the menu system and the online play with friends so frustrating I found myself having to take a breather after every quest. It would say one of us haven't progressed the story far enough to join, despite both of us going through all of the previous quests fine, then starting the quest solo to find out there was a 6 second cutscene, but then being stuck in that quest so having to go back to town to then join the same quest you were just on but with your friend... who is still in the same online session as you the whole time...Yeah it makes as much sense as typing that whole thing out did.Thumbs down for just pure frustration. Developers need to take some UI/UX design 101 courses, then come back and patch this mess.

Max	Recommended	262.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/enthusiasmenthusiast/	Needs fixing on technical issues, great and addicting gameplay.A lot of quality-of-life improvements over the classic titles, easily recommended for any fans.
MAD_FROGZ	Recommended	66.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MAD_FROGZ/	So I have now beaten the main story of MHW and I believe it is now appropriate to give it a review. Before I start off, full disclosure. I have played Monster Hunter games in the past. I’ve played 70hrs of Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Wii U and I’ve played 30hrs of Freedom Unite on the PPSSPP Emulator. Since enjoying those games years ago I have been eagerly anticipating a more streamlined Monster Hunter experience for a better and more powerful gaming system, namely the PC.This review will be broken up into 4 sections. The Good, The Bad, PC Performance, and a ConclusionThe Good:If you have never played a Monster Hunter game one of the best things it has going for it is its sense of progression. Over time the player feels a sense of how they have changed and adapted over the course of the game. This ranges from better and cooler looking gear to being more competent at the gameplay. While the player progresses and acquires new gear they will encounter roadblocks along the way, these are called Anjanath in LR and Nergigante and Vaal Hazak in HR (HOLY♥♥♥♥♥♥Val Hazzak is crazy). There are two ways to move on when one reaches this point, either grind for better gear by beating up the same monster a couple of times or improve tactically. Though at a certain point new gear is a must, but there is that option if you are good enough. This rinse and repeat is essentially the game play loop. You have to like this to enjoy the game, especially the very weighty and deliberate combat similar to the Souls Series (this came out first btw).For those who have not played a Monster hunter it is not an MMO (think similar to Warframe if you have played that). At the core it is a 4 player group up hunting game. It is the best game series on the market in my opinion for this type of game play. Co-op is a must to truly enjoy this game to the fullest.The game has a lot of content in it, however I’ll come back to this point later in the review.Streamlining of game’s systems has helped out this title immensely. The game has way less tedium than the older games in the series and more emphasis on the hunting with less time spend trying to find a damned flashbug.If you like the gameplay of the Monster Hunter Series this is everything that is good about it made better. However, those people have already bought this game. I’m hoping to speak to those more on the fence, especially if you are wondering if this game is for you. I will talk about this in the conclusion.The Bad:There is still tedium for things like ore mining and collecting materials this is made worse by the fact that the farming (like a garden) aspect of the game has been nerfed for some unknown bizarre reason.Finding the gems for monsters if RNGesus doesn’t look favorably on you can become terrible I know this from past Monster Hunter games, it is the same in this game, but I’ve yet to experience it.The story and its voice acting in both English and Japanese is absolutely terrible unredeemable trash. I have no idea why Capcom thought Monster Hunter needed a story. It’s terrible and it interferes with game play as you have to back out of the mission and restart just to do a story missions with friends.THE CUTSCENES ARE UNSKIPPABLE. WHY DO I HAVE TO WATCH UNCANNY VALLEY TALK TO UNCANNY VALLEY x12. I JUST WANT TO FIGHT MONSTERS!There is a lot of content in this game compared to other AAA games on the market, but compared to other Monster Hunter games it is shorter, While I understand why as they can’t just add all the old monsters as they need an HD revamp. Currently I feel a bit lonely without some classics like Tigrex, Brachydios, and Lagiacrus (I need water combat as an expansion plz). Without G-Rank the game is shorter than other Monster Hunter games so make of that what you will.PC Performance:So I will start with if you have anything less than a GTX 9-- series card or an Intel i7 6---k CPU you are SOL. These are pretty much needed to get 1080p 60fps. I have a GTX 1080 and an i7 8700k and I still get frame drops in the Teostra fight. This game needs a performance patch badly, some particle effects just wreck the game. Additionally, the new Nvidia drivers for the game are completely busted (398.82) roll back to the June drivers (398.36) you’ll gain 30fps. The game also has motion blur that is terrible, disabling the ingame anti aliasing makes it much better but the effect is still there. This needs to be patched. Finally the game is currently plagued with disconnects and its terrible I don’t get them often but some of my friends do. It’s really a mixed bag. I’ve heard mixed things about KB+M, but I don’t know as I use a controller and it works really well. The game is designed for it from the ground up. So overall the performance is just passable. (this is all as of 8/15/18)Luckily with the freedom of the PC in the future there may be more we can do with configuration and graphics stuff through modding ect. But that remains to be seen, except for a performance mod by the same guy that made FAR mod for Nier: Automata.Conclusion:If you love Monster Hunter and want to play it in glorious HD at 60fps you already bought the game. Personally if you are on the fence, go watch some gameplay and see if the core gameplay loop interests you. I wouldn’t recommend this game to everyone, but I would recommend everyone at least check it out as you may find it to be to your liking. I personally loved this game and it is my Game of the Year 2018 hands down. I think the western gaming industry at this point just makes pretentious political hit pieces and DLC simulators. This game is none of that, it has lots of great content, gameplay, and makes for great times with friends. And that is where the game shines brighter than anything else on the market, the fun gameplay coupled with the enjoyment of sharing it with a friend.Also the game will be receiving 4 new monster like the PS4 and XBONE version in the near future so Capcom seems committed to wanting the players to stick around likely because they will make an expansion with G-Rank, so keep that in mind as well.I hope this was helpful. If you have any questions feel free to ask in the comments. I will update this review in the future if the state of the game changes drastically with regards to performance and content.
I'm Diggity Dan	Recommended	100.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellizalot/	I love this game. Just what I've been waiting for.
NyxCrab	Recommended	454.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NyxCrab/	If you want a game where you just run around beating up huge monsters with a weapon larger than you are, this is the game for you. Despite how simple the weapons seem at first, every weapon has a surprising amount of depth to them both in combos and positioning when fighting monsters. It's addicting as all hell too, and can be really challenging even if sometimes that challenge feels cheap, most of the time it's fair and there's ways to avoid some of the more annoying attacks. Soundtrack is amazing too and it helps make hunts versus harder monsters feel that much more badass. The connection problems are pretty much entirely fixed at this time and it's not that hard to find SOS's SO LONG AS YOU REMEMBER TO NOT JUST USE "Low Rank" OR "High Rank" WHEN SEARCHING. That is a bit annoying, but it wasn't annoying enough to really annoy me once I figured that out. I highly recommend this game.

xano	Not Recommended	45.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034978959/	Pros:-Monster Hunter on PC!Cons:-It's clearly a port, so some of the controls and UIs were not designed for PC... Seems like this can easily be fixed though. (Controls are usually more than adjustable, but the UIs are a little hidden)-At the time of this review (19Aug2018) there are tons of bugs that literally make it impossible to play with friends, which should be the beauty of Monster Hunter, but unfortunately is a huge let-down..-No 21:9 support.Until at least 2/3 of the cons are addressed, I sadly can't recommend this for friends. =(But if you're fine with playing Single Player, go for it.
Tusk	Not Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tuskusson/	Great game but if you're after the online part its rubbish. Constant connection errors and Capcom wont even anwer a mail I send to their support team about it, they could have answerd: "We are aware of the problem and have no real solution at the moment but we are working on a fix" instead of silence. So the game looses points in my mind for having a crap publisher.

RelativelyFine	Recommended	18.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deshy7/	I never knew how stingy steam could get. All the negative reviews, Every One of Them, are complaining about the amount of bugs the game has. Isn't that expected from such a large MMORPG port in the first few weeks? Besides, games these days are only getting larger and more complex, ports are getting harder to do and with a game of this size and complexity, both major and minor bugs are bound to appear. People don't seem to understand that.None of these negatives are commenting on gameplay. Without a doubt, if you are willing to wait for the bugs to be ironed out, the game is an amazing experience, which should be apparent from the initial console release.

Jasmin	Recommended	191.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jasmin_shah/	Monster Hunter: World | My review for solo playersI was very excited for MH:W as this is my first ever Monster Hunter game. I am playing solo till I get really good at the game and my experience has been solid till now. I am loving everything this game has to offer. I am running the game with the highest settings at 1440p (except I've turned off the volumetric fog) and I'm getting 90-100 FPS, so I've no issues with the PC port, YMMV.THE BAD There are some connection issues for co-op gameplay and the stupid implementation of co-op in story missions makes it worse.(TBH, doesn't matter at all once the story is complete, which is when the game actually starts anyway).  Mediocre textures, definitely hoping for an HD texture pack in future.THE BEST The world feels so alive! I left Ark, because I couldn't stand how fake the dinos behaved. The map designs in this game are amazing, it doesn't feel like it is specially designed for hunting monsters or anything, it feels like a genuine "New World" with all sorts of birds, insects, animals, monsters and interactions between all of them.  Monster animations are absolutely amazing. (movements, attacks, reactions etc.). Each monster I have faced till now, feels truly unique and it clearly shows how much work has gone in designing them.  I am pleasantly surprised by astonishing amounts of weapons, slingshots, ammo, bombs, potions available to hunt the monster. There are just so many interesting tools you can use to make your hunting easier/interesting. The weapons are quite different than each other and their move-set feels very heroic. THE GOOD The grind isn't so bad like Warframe. Almost infinite inventory, so you don't need to worry about selling stuff or choosing which things to keep, ever! You get to keep all armor sets, weapons, charms, potions, traps, etc. There are no predatory micro-transactions to unlock cosmetics or anything else (except some random cheap DLCs on steam store). So many different type of quests you can select from. (Story missions, Investigations, Bounties, Expeditions*, Arena, Special Arena*, Limited time bounties, Deliveries and bunch of other side missions). Also, like consoles, we'll be getting behemoth hunts as well, so looking forward to it. (* = my favorite)     Armors for hunter and Palico look really cool. No loss for degrading weapons!!! So, if you get bored with one weapon, you can easily degrade it and upgrade some other weapon you want to use, that's just great! Lots of quality-of-life features in game to make things smoother for players unlike most games these days trying to prolong gameplay time (Like long press E to pickup stuff).So far, it feels like the game is 10/10 for single player gameplay experience, but because of the mediocre graphics, I'd rate it 9/10. And I hope by the time I start multiplayer, the connection issues will be resolved.  
Dr. Doctor, MD	Recommended	256.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/drdoctormd/	Never played a Monster Hunter game before in my life but this game is absolutely amazing and extremely addictive. The combat is fun and satisfying and the game has a serious plot but is quirky and very enjoyable. The game has had some network issues recently but it hasn't affected me too much at all. I can still join others online and request others to my game successfully. Only the occassional error for me. But I hear it's an issue with steam and they are on the way with fixes so that's goo news. Otherwise, amazing gameplay, epic large scale battles, fun as hell to play with others, and makes you feel like a badass! Even with the small network issues, I can still recommend this game.I'm not one to care too much about a PC port as others so yes there are also PC port issues, but they don't bother me so I can't take those into consideration. The game is fun and it has me hooked and that's all I ask for. Plus you have a walking cat as a companion (called a Palico) and a canteen of cat chefs that cook for you in an amazing cutscene. It's the little things in the game you have to love.
HayoMayo	Not Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gayomayo/	The gameplay and visuals are great.The UI and Menu system is an awful mess.Partying up with friends is a nightmare to navigate, getting quests going, getting into eachother's expeditions is a 6-7 step process despite being in the exact same online session (which in itself is 4-5 step process) just flat out inviting someone to your game wont work. They have to go to a specific NPC to join your game despite the invite.I found the menu system and the online play with friends so frustrating I found myself having to take a breather after every quest. It would say one of us haven't progressed the story far enough to join, despite both of us going through all of the previous quests fine, then starting the quest solo to find out there was a 6 second cutscene, but then being stuck in that quest so having to go back to town to then join the same quest you were just on but with your friend... who is still in the same online session as you the whole time...Yeah it makes as much sense as typing that whole thing out did.Thumbs down for just pure frustration. Developers need to take some UI/UX design 101 courses, then come back and patch this mess.

Who knows when that will be. If they're anything like SquareEnix, they will take years to release a patch regardless of the enormous outcry from disappointed customers for this absolute piece of shovelware. The game is amazing and has great potential but do not buy this EGREGIOUSLY unstable game for 59.99, if for nothing else, SOLELY ON PRINCIPLE.

Anfifo	Recommended	448.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/anfifo/	The bad (and reason for most downvotes):Classic problems at launch (connection mostly) but were mostly addressed or being addressed.Terrible port for now, needs really good machine for solid 60 fps, hopefully this will be addressed soon (for now u can use some mods to address fps drops)Some controls for Keyboard/Mouse feel weird so you're gonna have to costumise that and the mouse movement feels sluggish (there's been a response about having raw mouse input which would probably fix it)(So for now, I highly recommend playing with controller.)-------------The good (obvious personal opinion):- Some parts get really challenging, sometimes gives u that Souls-like boss experience where each "boss" has some different mechanics that you have to learn and counter to beat it.- Allows you to play coop with your friends but still have a great time alone or with randoms- Huge end game grinding- Detailed and varied skills and armours that allow u to make different kinds of builds- A lot of different weapons to choose from with completly different playstyles, making it so that there isnt one best weapons as the best weapon depends on the situation - making almost all weapons viable and useful.- Great community.- Good graphics.- Great overall gameplay

AteBitPixel	Not Recommended	138.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ATEBITPIXEL/	Been playing Monster Hunter for years. Loved every one of them. This one was no different when it came to console.

However, when it comes to the PC version of this I can say that there is one glaring issue that sucks the fun  right out of everything. Multiplayer. Yes the ONE thing Monster Hunter banks on is the ONE thing that is so screwed up in the PC version of the game. Wanna join a lobby? Better sacrifice a goat and pray to the old gods that it will connect you to one without throwing an error message. Wanna join a quest someone posted? Sure go ahead but you'd better make sure that all of your house has good feng shui or you may be disconnected from your party and LEFT WITH A VERY ANGRY MONSTER BY YOURSELF. The game itself is great. The gameplay is fun and engaging. The environments are gorgeous. And the story is a cool little thing we get to do that makes unlocking stuff that much more rewarding. But the issues with connectivity while online makes this whole thing a gamble to anyone playing and that's why I can NOT reccomend this game to anyone (at least the PC version) until they fix it.

Zfih	Recommended	29.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zfih/	I'm currently enjoying myself quite a bit with this game. It seems the PC port is well done, a few graphics settings that are missing would be nice to have patched in, but it is in my opinion not that bad with quite a few settings compared to other console ports. The online is more complicated than it should but the as long as you join a friend who is either at the same place in the story or behind you, it seems to function correctly. Only problem I've had with online is that I can't join a private session even with an invite, even though the game specifies that invites should still work. A little patch to fix these issues and the game is perfect. The gameplay is quite repetitive, but it is meant to be very grindy, as where the other Monster Hunter games. If you are not looking for a grindy game then this is not for you. I will definitely recommend this game for people who are interested in this kinda game, and like these types of games. If you are unsure if it is your cup of tea, I would suggest watching some gameplay videos or reviews as the intro scenario and tutorial takes more than 2 hours and therefore might remove any possibility of a refund.

prk`	Not Recommended	73.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/purekun/	TL;DR already - Game's good, negative review because c'mon really?Played a lot of 4U, quite a bit of XX, was hyped for MHW on PC because of solid framerate.MHW has done a lot of changes to the standard MH formula which have made the game more enjoyable to play (easier gathering, easier inventory management, less useless quests). The locations became full ecosystems which works well with the design of the game. Weapons feel smooth and are less clunky (eg greatsword allows for a roll back after a strike, making the fight more dynamic and results in fewer feelings of "f*** this game".However, the question here is if I recommend this game.No. Absolutely not, at least not in this current state. I run the game with a few years old i5 and a geforce 960 on 55-60fps. Usually 60fps but the game randomly stutters for a couple of frames. While playable, there's no reason why that should be the case. Most of the people I know can't run the game well, even with good rigs. Some run the game on 45 fps with everything on low. The optimization is just poorly done and people are accusing both denuvo as well as capcom for writing bad code and rendering things out of sight needlessly.If you're not sure, get the game and either refund or not but in this current state, the game cannot be recommended.When there's either a patch or a fanmade mod that fixes the framerate issues, I'll gladly update this review.

minusthedrifter	Not Recommended	351.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/minusthedrifter/	Not recommending this game isn't easy for me, given how many hours I have invested in this game it's pretty obvious I enjoy this game. However, sadly Capcom has seriously ♥♥♥♥ed over the PC port and they do not deserve to be rewarded for this behavior.First off, the game was delayed ~7 months from the console and it was reported that the delay was to make sure the port was the best port they could possibly make. That was absolutely not the case, the PC release was crippled with connection issues, mouse and keyboard issues and texture problems. Months later while the connection issues have largely been solved the PC still cannot display textures on High without mods and a number of keys cannot be rebound. However the biggest issue and what caused me to finally not recommend this game is content. As previously mentioned the PC port was delayed over 7 months and unlike every other game ever they decided NOT to release all of the already released content for PC and instead opted for "accelerated release" of that already completed content. However that accelerated release was nothing but a bait and switch. The only monster we got early compared to the console was the Deviljho, over a month ago, and since then? Nothing. They were mum on the Autumn Festival until the last minute leading many to believe we weren't even going to get it, however what we did get is a SHADOW of the amount of content the console. The PC got exactly one new quest from the event and no new monsters or events beyond. Literally the entire event can be finished in about a half hour to an hour. Now, today Capcom has revealed the PC won't be seeing Kulve Taroth, the big raid everyone's been waiting for until sometime in November. That means for another month the PC will have nothing the the base vanilla content for another month for a game that's been out for nearly a year. Absolutely unacceptable. The game is a total blast and I've loved all my hours in it but I cannot honestly recommend this game given Capcoms handling of the PC. We're missing so much content, our holiday event is neutered and there are still numerous bugs romaing freely. Capcom doesn't deserve your money.
Zephkiel	Recommended	164.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Allister_Damascus/	Let's be honest there - it's not a proper review.Most people are just crying about the DRM or some togglable option.The game itself is very good, and i have no issues running it at 3440x1440 resolution, with an almost 8 years old CPU and a GTX1070.Content wise, we all  know that MH:W is really, really good.

The most you can do is swap the L/R buttons so ex. R1 fires and R2 runs.  Additionally, practically all the buttons have additional functionality, some which seems random at times, especially in menus and with certain weapon types.  It's very hard to keep track of.It is utterly asinine if you've played most action RPGs that exist. The controls are uncomfortable, confusing, and we have to deal with it because for some godforsaken reason they couldn't add gamepad remapping, be it ingame or via Steam.-- Button prompts are for Xbox controllers. Dualshock users are shafted.Edit: Mod fix[www.resetera.com] It was already in the game files and the Steam API presented the controller to the game. Capcom failed miserably at porting.--- Controller may not even work at all if Steam's native support for it is disabled.Mouse emulates an analog stick.  It's borderline unusable.- See this video for example/explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0Y2aDAupZ4-- Strangely the mouse operates just fine in the menus, with some slight input lag. Way better map control than gamepad.Keyboard control is sub-par, notably in menus, but otherwise usable. Expect to rebind stuff though.- There's no way to slowly walk with keyboard.-- Certain keys cannot be bound.Camera control keys hardcoded to OKL; and cannot be changed.Overall, it feels like a console game in design through and through.  Repeated "saving don't turn off the game" messages, menus are clunky with KB/M and take far too long to do anything, etc. You can't even exit the options menu without it prompting you to save, even if nothing changed, and if you decline it's just an endless loop.  It takes a goddamn minute to get to the main menu.Low-res textures on numerous assets.  Some textures are LOWER QUALITY than the console version, presumably due to a bug. Example[i.imgur.com], Example 2[i.imgur.com] This was discovered a month before launch and still isn't fixed.No way to disable depth of field (or motion blur).   It's extremely aggressive and 70% of the screen is regularly blurred in cutscenes.  Even opening your map the entire screen is blurred: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1472048946- Denuvo is blocking attempts to disable DoF and Motion Blur.  #DRMFXAA and TAA only.  Both blur the screen to ludicrous levels and barely help the aliasing.  (Yet again another game that lacks the superior SMAA)Ambient Occlusion is low quality and produces a grid-like pattern on character models.  This is ugly and nothing can be done to remedy it besides turning off AO, ruining the shadowing.Performance is very poor for the 1:1 port this is. Volumetric fog chunks framerate by 20%, ontop of making everything look washed out.  Best to disable it both for performance and image quality (in most areas).  On a weaker system?  You're gonna struggle.- Water reflections only change the color of water in certain lighting and cause immense draw call increases, disable them too.- Screen Space Reflections are broken and do nothing but lower framerate, again disable them too.- Anisotropic filtering is broken and does nothing, must force from GPU drivers.- Load times are based on framerate.  Running at a high framerate significantly lowers load times.  RIP Vsync users (which should be everyone, because tearing is terrible).- Elemental effects on attacks cause stuttering and massive frame drops.  Someone could be on the complete opposite side of the map as you but your game is constantly stuttering every time they hit something.  There is no way to fix this.Non-PC specific:Voice acting is only used in certain parts of the game. Majority of the dialogue is text only.Cannot go through cutscenes with other people. You have to be solo to watch them.- Gonna co-op with a friend? One of you needs to complete the campaign first! ..or start the quest, play up until you see the cutscene, exit quest, re-group; for every mission.  Just wtf?-- Lobby system is also terrible. Squads use Steam Groups, not anything ingame.  You can only see other players in the 'gathering hub', an area almost no one goes to.  There's a max of 16 people in one 'lobby' at a time, and most only have 1-3 people with only ~15 lobbies displayed in the lobby finder at a time.--- There are endless connection issues from the game servers being overloaded.  It's been over a week and all Capcom has said was "we're working on it".  Multiplayer is effectively broken. Edit: Patch 2 weeks later only fixed people disconnecting mid mission; still numerous issues.Item saving system is convoluted as hell and your item bar/wheels are saved to specific loadouts. The game never tells you this.Monster parts are listed as being separate for 'carve' and 'reward' options.  The 'carve' parts can all be obtained from rewards, misleading players into thinking they have to kill/carve the monster to obtain them (vs capturing).Supposedly we have an older build of the game compared to consoles.  Missing the latest content.  Cannot confirm myself.7 months to port the game and they couldn't do it properly, despite saying they were taking the time to do it properly.Now to wait and see how quickly modders fix it.Good thing there's $51 worth of DLC already.

Kapot	Recommended	245.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kapot/	You can hunt monsters in a world so I guess the game is delivering everything it promised.The game is pretty much perfect if you don't take into account Denuvo, the connection instability (edit: they fixed those in a patch some time ago) and the fact that the game makes it pretty annoying to play through story mode with a friend (you can't join the mission unless they're done watching all the unskippable cutscenes and events).Despite those issues I'm having a lot of fun. It's worth the full price in my opinion.

Aiko™	Recommended	15.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AikoTM/	Regardless of all the negative reviews, i'm enjoying this game quite a lot.I got stable 60+ FPS and graphics don't look that bad either.Yes, there might be a slight downgrade compared to the console version but it's barely noticable, unless you really really search for it. Not even sure if it is intended or just a bug - so might be fixed in the future.Takes a while to get used to the combat if you are one of them button mashers - you will learn over time tho, just don't give up right away.Also the steam page says Partial Controller Support but i don't know where this partial is from. My Microsoft Xbox One Controller works just fine.. everywhere.The games does currently have some multiplayer issues.Disconnects or plain not able to connect at all. I'm sure this is gonna get fixed in the near future tho.Tip: For Daily Rewards just create an own session. For some reason they work without any issues.That's all i have to say for now.In my book, money well spend. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
charliewaffles	Recommended	90.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/charliewafflesbr/	There's no way I'm not recommending MHW on PC, with that said, the port is far from perfect. Here's a few reasons why:- Doesn't run great, despite running on a 10 year old engine and not offering a significant enough improvement over the (far less powerful) console versions. - Poor scalability. Other than the volume rendering setting, you're lucky if you're able to squeeze 15fps going from Highest to Low. On the plus side, this means the game will look relatively similar across the board, but seeing as how PC is all about offering as many options as possible, I think the bad outweighs the good in this case. - Low resolution textures and character shadows across the board. The game looks washed out, same as the console versions, you can fix that by disabling the volumetric fog but I'm not sure it's worth the compromise. - No Dualshock 4 support or button prompts. I've seen far more modest games supporting this feature, so it's a mystery to me why Capcom chose to not include it here. - Mouse and Keyboard controls are serviceable, but not great. Same as Yakuza 0, a controller is pretty much required if you want to get the most out of this game. It's better than the console versions, but not by much. Pound for pound, I feel like the console version is able to achieve more with considerably less, so good luck running this at console quality visuals on a 400$ (price of a PS4 Pro) PC. I feel like they could've done a lot more with this port, but I'm still gonna recommend it simply because you can technically push the visuals/performance further if you have the hardware for it. Just don't expect to do so on anything under 800$.Edit: It does support my Dualshock 4, it just doesn't recognize it as a Dualshock 4. It thinks it's an Xbox One controller, so no touch pad support or DS4 button prompts. But it does work.

If not it's a great single player game when it gets down to $20.

Hiro シ	Recommended	122.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050825683/	Runs perfectly fine on a GTX 1060 6GB and a i5-8400. Settings: High, Volumetric Rendering: Off = 60FPS with very ocational ~10 FPS dips in the forest area (which was already the most demanding area in the PS4 version) although hardly noticable.The game has native controller support as I am playing with a PS4 Controller without DS4 Windows.For some odd reason restarting my PC after the installation and first start fixed the initial blackscreen and the controller support.If you're wondering about the game outside of how it runs: It is worth the 60€/$ Tag 100%. Addictive as much as every other Monster Hunter game and really easy to put in hundreds of hours. Although described as clunky by many new to the series the controlls fit perfectly to the flow of the fights, weapons actually feel like they have a heavy weight. The 14 weapon types are completely different from each other in their overall behaviour, the lance for example gives you the best block in the game and you move like a tank while double swords give a hightened freedom of movement for the sacrifice of a useful block. Each weapon has unique gimmicks that are easy to learn and hard to master, mastering techniques is only one half mastering the movement of the monster is the other. Caution: The game only gives you attack inputs but it doesn't show you how you can mix them up which can result in you feeling feeling like you do well with your weapon but not realizing that you only use about 60% of its potential. For example: The Great Sword shoulder cancel into the 2nd and 3rd stage of the charge.Every big monster you kill and most small monster give you material that you can use to make armor of that specific monster, your cat companion also gets many armor variants which look amazing.The fights are spectacular and ~30 big monster variants provide enough variation to put in dozens of hours. Plus the game will most definetly get frequent free updates with more content like the PS4 version already showed.

Papi№ri	Recommended	51.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PapiNori/	I will own up and now and say I am a huge MH fan and have been through most of the games where things weren't so streamlined and where things looked uggo. I think MHW is falling flat, gameplay wise for people in two ways and for one reason. It's accessable. MH fans might feel jarred or put off by some of the more convienient and less restrictive flow of MHW. It feels less structured and rigid than previous titles, even those with a bit of story. I was certainly thinking, 'wow, that's easier. That makes it less MH' But then there were so many systems in place that at points I felt a bit overwhelmed by new ways of doing things. All done I assume to make it more accessable to people unfamiliar with the franchise.And I think this is where newer people might come unstuck. There's a lot to take in because of this and the first few hours was tutorial based things. I am not even sure I am out of it yet. It still has the MH feel of dropping you in and letting you go despite this, which is great but also bad because newer players might not really get to the meat of the game before dismissing it. It sort of feels midground.I have had a couple crashes and one issue with online but that has been it. The online is a little confusingly done but so much better than the way it used to be, once you get your head round it, it's not so bad. Room for improvement though.It also runs... Not as well as you would hope. I have a mid tier system and it runs well enough on mid settings for it still to be a pretty game. But its not a smooth 60 experience. But coming from those 3DS days, or even PSP, I don't care.But the game play... Oh it's there alright.There is so much more to do other than slash and smash your way through a roster of monsters and this game is oozing personality in lots of subtle ways. It's great. There is a lot of content in this game, if you are willing to put the time in and learn what it's about. The combat is great on KBM, I was planning on using a controller but I actually prefer KBM. MH games have a really great combat system, with lots of subtle things and it isn't for everyone admittedly but if you are a MH fan, this title stays true but innovates enough to be fresh.The quest system wasn't what I was used to either, it feels much more RPG or MMO styled, picking up quests that aren't story based from NPCs related to what they do in regards to rewards. But it's actually a really nice change and much more immersive than 'pick from this list'.My recommendation is with caution, if you love MH you can't miss this one. If you've played MH before and thought, meh, this one might be the one to get you hooked. If you don't know if you like MH, you like hack n slash or you are expecting a Dark Souls experience tm, do lots of research before buying because it isn't for everyone and with some of the less appealing points, such as optimisation, it might not be for you.

Moist Nugget	Recommended	232.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkethus/	wowie, this is a juicy one. First of all, don't be an idiot and post a bad review for a game when it doesnt start for you. If it doesnt start, there is something wrong. In this case, if you dont have FMA3-instruction-capability on your CPU, the game won't run. This would be really bad, BUT IT REALLY ISNT BECAUSE CAPCOM HAVE SAID THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF IT. THEY WILL BE PATCHING THE GAME LATER TODAY FOR IT. YOUVE WAITED FOR 7,5 MONTHES, YOU CAN WAIT A COUPLE MORE HOURS.I can understand that people get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥when the game they have been looking forward to has a bug at launch, and I can agree that its really bad of Capcom to not have that figured out this far. However, leaving a bad review is just braindead. What if IGN, Levelcap, TotalBiscuit (may his soul rest at 144fps) or any other reviewer came out with a negative review because of a bug that lasted all of 6 hours after launch.Now that I have ranted about stupid people doing stupid things, let's actually talk about this game.FIrst of all, performance (as that is what gives my e-peen power): I am running on an i7-6700k (4.5GHz), a GTX 1080ti (no overclock) and I have the game on an SSD. I want the game to run at the best possible graphics at the best possible framerate.The framerate on my machine when running around both in the World and in Astera is around 120-130. BEFORE YOU SCREAM FOR YOUR MOTHER TO GET YOU YOUR CHICKEN TENDIES, LET ME EXPLAIN WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED BY SO MANY OTHERS. For the love of everything that is holy, turn off Volumetric Clouds/Volumetric Rendering. This what is said in the currently top trending review as a PSA. This is also said in a TON of articles where they review the performance of the game. The exact ingame name for the option is "VOLUME RENDERING QUALITY". This adds another level to the lighting in the game, and it makes it look like there is a ton of bad bloom on the screen. It looks fantastic for screenshots, but it looks horrific for gameplay. It also pulls my frames from 120-130 to 70-80. Even though TONS of people have told you to not use it, there are still buckets of reviews saying that the game is badly optimized.I played the game a lot on PS4, and the game there not only looks worse, but also plays worse. The keyboard controls in this game are really quite nice in my opinion. The only problem I had with the controls on Keyboard is the radial menu. YOu get it up by holding down Q. You then select from the menu using WASD. This is also how you walk. If you acidentally press Q, it will automatically press the item on the top of your radial menu, which is my case is sharpening. This is really bad, as sharpening when I wanna run is not good. There is a fix. Go to the control settings and change Radial Menu Settings from Type 1 to Type 2. Voila. THAT IS HOW YOU FIX PROBLEMS, NOT BY LAYING ON THE GROUND AND REVIEW-BOMBING A GAME, BUT BY TRYING TO FIX THEM.There is another problem with the radial menu. You can have 8 items in a wheel. We have an item Straight up, to the left, to the right and to the bottom.  THere is also an item inbetween each, at a diagonal, aka northwest, southeast etc... I cant get to those items, the ones that are diagonal. If i click W and D at the same time, it would either choose the W item or the D item, not the NorthEast item. This will probably be fixed. The menu also says "RS" as in right stick. I dont have a right stick game, I am using keyboard controls.EDIT FOR THIS PART: IF YOU HAVE THIS PROBLEM, CHANGE THE "RADIAL MENU TYPE" IN ITEMS AND EQUIPMENT. Shoutout to the legend "Jebbe" for showing me this!Other than those problems, the keyboard controls are rebindable, and they are efficient enough for me to use. I main chargeblade, and it works really well with the chargeblade. I cant say if all weapons will be as good with keyboard, but I can bet that all ranged weapons will be dreams to use.The mouse-movement is too smooth, aka, it doesnt stop when I stop moving the mouse. There is not mouse-acceleration, but stopping the mouse makes the camera "drift" slightly. This is not too disturibing, but getting an option to turn off mousesmoothing would be great.oh yeah, and its a blast to play.

Lormeron	Recommended	123.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035005392/	This game is incredible, and if you like any of the previous installments I believe you will enjoy this one too. The graphics are detailed and clean, the game runs really well if you turn off volumetric rendering and they have improved on a lot on the quality of life in this one ( not having to drink hot/cold drinks and paintballing monsters to name a few).Currently the only major issue for this game is the disconnecting issues, which the devs have already stated they are working with Valve to resolve.  But don't do yourself a disservice and pass up this game because of all the negative reviews based around that one single fact. This game is absolutely fantastic and I am glad that Monster Hunter has finally made it's way to PC. Do yourself a favor and try it out- you can always refund it.

Grass	Recommended	41.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013516358/	The most fun I've had in a long time. Combat is fluid and satisfying, monsters are varied and challenging, lots of depth and a ridiculous amount of replayability. Granted it is in dire need of some post-release love (connectivity is finicky, optimization could be better, hopefully G-rank stuff is coming down the line) but these issues pale in comparison to the sheer amount of F U N this game brings to the table. Highly recommended, bring friends.
Molvonos	Not Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975902628/	Until they fix multiplayer, it's really not worth my time.  Trying to play the game with my room mates, who were equally excited to play MHW after hearing about it, is a horrible headache.  Forcing the cinematics and the hoops we have to go through for Expeditions is obscene.  I -wish- I could get a refund, but it took 2 hours just to get to the point where I could join my roomie in killing the first group monster.  I feel this was deliberate on Capcom and Steam's side, to force people to keep the game, bugs and all.
Ryvucz	Not Recommended	89.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006521459/	If you use a keyboard and mouse, due to ya know, being on PC, expect to have some seriously screwed up controls that change drastically when using a bow.It goes from mouse middle wheel when on your back, to CTRL+ Left or Right mouse button, to CTRL+Directional key radial menu when you are walking. Completely screwing you over because for some dumb reason, the control scheme changes.The mechanics get pretty damn annoying, you fight monsters for a living, but you♥♥♥♥♥♥your pants everytime you hear them roar, screech or otherwise fart in your direction, because they're big and scary monsters, and you should fear them, always, when they make noise.Expect the need to sharpen your melee weapons often, becuase they start becoming dull (read useless) with each hit. If you don't eat at the canteen before every outing, expect to be nerfed heavily for damage, health and defense.You have the dumbest 'handler' whom always gets you in trouble, herself in trouble, and everything and everyone around her in trouble.Your cat (Pelico) AI is really damn dumb.Your Tailraider AI are really damn dumb.

Lormeron	Recommended	123.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035005392/	This game is incredible, and if you like any of the previous installments I believe you will enjoy this one too. The graphics are detailed and clean, the game runs really well if you turn off volumetric rendering and they have improved on a lot on the quality of life in this one ( not having to drink hot/cold drinks and paintballing monsters to name a few).Currently the only major issue for this game is the disconnecting issues, which the devs have already stated they are working with Valve to resolve.  But don't do yourself a disservice and pass up this game because of all the negative reviews based around that one single fact. This game is absolutely fantastic and I am glad that Monster Hunter has finally made it's way to PC. Do yourself a favor and try it out- you can always refund it.

JonJon^	Recommended	36.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JonJon89/	Early review from a casual gamer - I get why some people would be upset but for my brother and I our online co-op experience has been great. No disconnections or issues. The main questline co-op thing is frustrating at first but it's not even a big deal. As soon as the quest tells you that you're able to call in mates for help (which is when the main part of the quest is coming in anyway, i.e kill the monster), just leave the quest, post it up on the board, and your friend can join it with you then if he has done the same. I actually really like the PC controls. I put many hours in on MH back on the PSP so that's probably why LOL. Mid range PC at best, running amazing on medium settings with the volume fog turned off. Loving this so far!

wanderingsword	Not Recommended	160.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074795936/	I'ma start this off with this: This game is incredibly fun to play, especially with friends; however there in lies the crux of the problem: the servers are 100% trash. You are constantly disconnected from the servers while playing multiplayer and if you have a friend or rando join your mission, the monsters become exponentially harder. Alright. Fair. BUT, if everyone leaves the mission for whatever reason, including server issues, the monsters do not regress back to their normal difficulty, leaving you stuck fighting enemies much much harder than they should be. This makes the game very very frustrating to play, and i can't reccommend it until they fix their server issues.

Moh	Not Recommended	183.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000543293/	Monster Hunter World feels like it could have been something awesome - and do not mistake my recommendation against it, World is a great game, worthy of praise. Unfortunately it lets down it's roots in subtle but telling ways.TL;DR: Gorgeous game that makes great strides in streamlining the Monster Hunter formula for western plebs, but fails with optimization which feels worse on PC than on Console and, tired, old, frustrating and BORING end-game grinds to pad out gameplay. Beyond that there are no indications that PC players of World will have, or ever get access to the iconic event fights available to Console versions.The Good:- Gorgeous graphics and designs for characters, monsters, environments and animals. Everything feels alive and the world feels like something is in it beyond the obligatory monsters to hunt.- Great streamlining of previous formulae for the various weapon classes. None feel useless, even if they aren't your preference. Mechanics are easy to learn, but difficult to master, and rewarding for the trial and error of mastering said weapons.- The scoutfly tracking mechanics are interesting and helpful, especially for newcomers to the series.- Quick (ish) ability to connect with friends or random allies to join them on hunts, or invite aid on your own hunts.**This relies on online always being available, which is not always the case given the early and ongoing issues between Steam matchmaking and Capcom's servers.The Let-Down:- The graphics, while beautiful and stunning, aren't properly optimized for PC and, in fact, high end PC's are unable to outperform consoles for graphical quality and fidelity, purely due to the poor optimization.- Mouse and keyboard controls are directly punished by using forced gamepad emulation - including an enforced deadzone - which makes interface navigation and overall game control feel muddy and far slower than necessary.- Certain fights, while memorable, aren't particularly challenging or rewarding. The final boss stands out for being a time-sink, simply due to how much health it has.- The end game falls back on tired, frustrating "does more damage" variants of monsters to hunt, rather than previous versions 'G-Rank' which introduces challenging new mechanics to existing monsters, and G-Rank specific monsters. - The grind for end game decorations to maximize certain weapon and armor builds is particularly punishing, as the mechanics rely on layered RNG outcomes: First for getting the quests to hunt said end-game monsters; then the random chance of getting a decoration as a reward; third in that the decoration rewards and random; fourth in that any useless decorations can only be re-randomized by an in-game vendor - with no option to 'force' any particular outcome, beyond save-scumming (which the developers would rather you don't do, to further extend your time grinding).- Events and Event Monsters are on an annual timetable - if they are, or ever will be available AT ALL - where in previous games, such events and event hunts were either always available once released, or were otherwise easily accessible to repeat if needed.Summary:I got Monster Hunter World because I absolutely can't stand playing the series on tiny hand-helds with my oven-mitt sized hands, squinting at the action on equally tiny screens. The high praise of World lets it down severely under scrutiny, as every effort that could have been made to make the title a stellar stand-out for the franchises first PC release feels disappointing and half-baked.For casual players, this still might be fun and enjoyable, if you can ignore some of the games glaring flaws. For diehard fans, this could very well be a pass, compared to the quality and quantity offered by other Monster Hunter titles.

Cr1ngeUnh|nged	Recommended	93.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Memequeen2k17/	What a wonderful game! Most definitely recommend it. The graphics and animations are gorgeous, the story is entertaining and keeps me interested, so is the monster hunting! I can hunt a monster a hundred times and I won't get bored, simply because this game is heavily skill based when it comes to dodging attacks and sneaking in a potion or two. This game keeps me on high alert when hunting for Monster bosses!Let's not forget the cats! Oh my god they are IRRESISTABLY ADORABLE! I cannot skip the Canteen cutscenes, these cats are just so... Damn.. Cute.. I squeal in delight every time I hear their little meows! What a perfect touch to such a game!Fortunately, the quality overall of this game makes up for it's very, very minor flaws- such as the targeting system and the delayed attacks(by this I mean you have to wait until your attacks are finished before you can turn around or move in SOME cases). It would be lovely if they added some sort of attack cancelations besides the sudden dodging. Overall, however, I rate this game a 10/10. I can't wait to see how much more it progresses!

XxX_D4RKvSK0P3Z_XxX	Not Recommended	8.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkscopes/	First of all, I think the gameplay is done pretty well and the game is enjoyable so far.However, the port to PC is done terribly. - No option to disable motion blur, sorry for the large number of people who get motion sickness.- The mouse input has reverse acceleration and is basically emulating a joystick, so everything feels really clunky and awful to navigate. I cannot stress how much this takes away from the combat gameplay.- Optimization is greatly lacking. I got an average of ~35 frames on an RX 580 / Ryzen 2700X and ~50 after disabling volumetric rendering.- The menus are clearly designed for a console and very unintuitive with no changes to the layout or even adding in a scrollable field. If there are 25 items within a menu, instead of being able to smoothly scroll through all 25, they are locked to pages.- Going off of the last point, the escape button doesn't work to exit out of any of the menus. What modern day game or application doesn't make use of the escape button in 2018? It's such an intuitive action for me to take and after 5 hours I still find myself trying to hit escape to exit out of menus instead of the right mouse button.- They also didn't bother to change a good number of tooltips off of their respective Xbox buttons rather than the actual keybind. This may be nitpicking, but it really does feel like a game made for console through and through.tl;dr: Game is great, PC port is done awfully.
xQUATROx	Not Recommended	57.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AstroAss/	Day1 review: I'm a HUGE fan of the MH series, but I'm giving this game a thumb down and a middle finger up for the following reasons (until fixes are issued):1) MOUSE CONTROLS ARE HORRIBLE! What they did was map the mouse to a virtual analog stick, so you deal with things like "deadzones" and a speed cap for movement, making everything very stupid on the mouse. RIP gunners... Don't force me to play with a damn controller! The chinese MH Online works wonderfully with a mouse - apparently Japan has no PC gaming industry and knows nothing about how things are done...*smh*2) Online keeps dropping. So far my friends haven't got the game, so not yet a problem, but will need to be sorted out3) Weird bloom/blur over everything... I want a sharp, contrasted image, not a mess that maybe used to work on a TV a bazillion feet away from one's eyes with contrast pumped up on the TV.4) Too many things are mapped onto the same keys. Again, going back comparing to MH Online - MH World needs more flexibility... I'm a blademaster, but I hear gunners have problems with this particularly.5) This probably also worked on TVs a bazillion miles away from your face, but the texture detail is pretty garbage up-close... Definitely needs a high res texture pack!6) Tutorials....tutorials...more tutorials... I'm sick of them!!!! I'm a veteran and there should have been an option to turn the damn things off, like in all the previous releases. You know, you load up a game and it asks "have you played before? Do you need a tutorial?"- you hit "no, F off, I'm a veteran" and go have some fun...Annoying stuff that annoys the crap out of me as a long-time MH fan who played EVERYTHING ever since MH Freedom on PSP:1) Story. Sorry, but it's not only unnecessary but also crap. I Want to hunt monsters and craft stuff, not spend an hour on cinematic and "follow this guy" nonsense. The old games had almost no story and it was perfect.2) Autocraft of potions is weird3) Why am I allowed to have the full item box in the camp? Makes no sense. The old inventory system worked wonders, even with the addition of transporter felynes - made gathered item management a good and realistic gameplay mechanic.4) The "fireflies" or whatever they are. Stupid mechanic, takes up too much screen space, too much hand-holding and glows in your face for no reason. Hate it.Notes: Don't know if it's my settings or what, but 60-80fps on a 1080Ti (no SLI support, so I can't use my second card) at 1440p is a bit...low...I'll update this as I discover new things and the game gets updated. Hoping for fixes at LEAST for the darn mouse emulation thing, raw input is a MUST.

cafelattis	Not Recommended	63.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079760699/	First of all i do like this game! It is a nice looking game that is a bit difficult and has a LOT of different playstyles with 14 unique weapons ! Especially the heavier weapons. They feel heavy and hit hard!But i feel that this is a co op multiplayer game first and foremost, and when a coop game has a LOT of server problems with a lot of disconnects. A very strange and annoying way to play with my friends. I just cannot recomend this game. Maybe play offline solo, but i think you miss a lot of the fun of the game when a bunch of players with diffrent weapons just destroys a massive monster (or the moster destroying you), that is a lot of fun. I would say wait until they fix multiplayer. Then the game is great!

One time you can be lucky and multiplayer works and another it just flat out does not. The performance is subpar and the game straight up drops frames for frequently occuring visual effects. The situation with mods being possible but no one knowing what is allowed and might get you banned in the future is also not good.

While I'm loving it and will undoubtedly put a ton of hours into killing some big bois, I can't deny that the pc port has some issues.ProsAmazing world to explore, both alone and with friendsIs very beginner friendly, for the most part.Seemingly a lot of nuance to learn."Grind" doesn't seem tedious at all.Weapons and armor all feel/look very distinct.Fast loading times.Cat friend.Game personally has given me no performance issues, despite having fairly mid-tierish hardware.No issues with Xbox controller.ConsAbsolutely awful menu design. Way too many tabs to navigate to do even the most basic options.No quitting mid-mission, even if alone. Game forces you to close the process via task manager.Glitch? Where whenever you or a friend plays, it constantly notifies others that you're playing the game, as if you just had launched it. Going invisible and disabling notifications "fixes" it, but unacceptable to have to resort to that.While it runs fine on my pc, it's showing to have fairly lackluster performance on a lot of machines. (I recommend Digitial Foundry's latest video on the matter).Playing with friends or others in general is more of a hassle than it should be - often requiring you to view a cutscene, back out, then invite your friend if you want to do the story together. No push-to-talk. It doesn't bother me typically, but it can get annoying to hear constant music, chewing, Discord talk, etc from others.Have seen reports of issues with using a DS4 controller.

Sorry, but it's not only unnecessary but also crap. I Want to hunt monsters and craft stuff, not spend an hour on cinematic and "follow this guy" nonsense. The old games had almost no story and it was perfect.2) Autocraft of potions is weird3) Why am I allowed to have the full item box in the camp? Makes no sense. The old inventory system worked wonders, even with the addition of transporter felynes - made gathered item management a good and realistic gameplay mechanic.4) The "fireflies" or whatever they are. Stupid mechanic, takes up too much screen space, too much hand-holding and glows in your face for no reason. Hate it.Notes: Don't know if it's my settings or what, but 60-80fps on a 1080Ti (no SLI support, so I can't use my second card) at 1440p is a bit...low...I'll update this as I discover new things and the game gets updated. Hoping for fixes at LEAST for the darn mouse emulation thing, raw input is a MUST.

Ivan	Not Recommended	10.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962507126/	Overall fun game. But GUI is not meant for PC which is sad, same goes for party options, not really intuative.
DirtyBrownTaco	Not Recommended	50.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dirtybrowntaco/	 Fun game, bad port I don't recommend this game right now, but will revise if Capcom gets to patchingand optimizing a little moreMy first ever Monster Hunter game. While I'm loving it and will undoubtedly put a ton of hours into killing some big bois, I can't deny that the pc port has some issues.ProsAmazing world to explore, both alone and with friendsIs very beginner friendly, for the most part.Seemingly a lot of nuance to learn."Grind" doesn't seem tedious at all.Weapons and armor all feel/look very distinct.Fast loading times.Cat friend.Game personally has given me no performance issues, despite having fairly mid-tierish hardware.No issues with Xbox controller.ConsAbsolutely awful menu design. Way too many tabs to navigate to do even the most basic options.No quitting mid-mission, even if alone. Game forces you to close the process via task manager.Glitch? Where whenever you or a friend plays, it constantly notifies others that you're playing the game, as if you just had launched it. Going invisible and disabling notifications "fixes" it, but unacceptable to have to resort to that.While it runs fine on my pc, it's showing to have fairly lackluster performance on a lot of machines. (I recommend Digitial Foundry's latest video on the matter).Playing with friends or others in general is more of a hassle than it should be - often requiring you to view a cutscene, back out, then invite your friend if you want to do the story together. No push-to-talk. It doesn't bother me typically, but it can get annoying to hear constant music, chewing, Discord talk, etc from others.Have seen reports of issues with using a DS4 controller. 
megagrunt	Not Recommended	135.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/megagrunt/	This is an amazing game, but the PC port is just atrocious. One time you can be lucky and multiplayer works and another it just flat out does not. The performance is subpar and the game straight up drops frames for frequently occuring visual effects. The situation with mods being possible but no one knowing what is allowed and might get you banned in the future is also not good.
Makenboshi	Not Recommended	224.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Makenboshi/	Unless you're a monster hunter fan, avoid buying for the full price.-bad port-little to no optimization-uses denuvo (sorry linux users)-game update lacking too far behind console versionI'd say for now buy the console version. A lot more stable.MHW itself is a very good game, hope they can patch this soon. I'll change the review once they do.Update: Seems the performance issue is getting better and better, especially with NVIDIA driver update (411.63), but still not enough to change my recommendation yet.Network issue is also fixed now.
Need for Yeet	Not Recommended	68.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yalestinkt/	Bad performance, bad servers, because of that it gets tiring pretty fast. Pls just fix this...
Couby	Not Recommended	140.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982332208/	Love this game but connection issues make it impossible to play with friend which is why i bought it....When people join you, monsters go to 250% in stats no matter numbers of player (2, 3 or 4) and stay at this level even if group disband.Since beginning, it's very unlikely to finish a quest without a disconnection and then you fight a 250% monster alone.Or you can just play forever alone and have a fair challenge.. but don't hope to play with your friends... 
deadering	Recommended	129.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deadering/	Not optimized as well as it could be, but a lot better than I feared.Really that's the only bad thing. It looks amazing, especially with the volumetric fog and weather and day/night system.It's the first game I've played where the world truly feels alive. I was worried about open areas but it's a massive step up from previous Monster Hunter games. It feels like you've entered a real place that developed naturally, full of living, breathing creatures.The combat and gameplay are top-notch. MH has always had amazing combat but they have streamlined it over the years. I was worried it was getting too simplistic but as a veteran it's nice to see how many quality of life improvements they've made. Clearly the dev team really care about Monster Hunter and haven't lost touch like a lot of games sequels seem to.The combat feels heavier and more impactful than ever, but also more fluid. It's like the offspring of old Monster Hunter and Dark Souls.Really I'm just scratching the surface but this is the first significant upgrade we've seen to Monster Hunter since the original. Capcom has always taken it easy, using handhelds and the weakest consoles of the generations. Granted, they pushed those consoles to their limits, but it was always so much less than it could have been with more powerful hardware.I've always dreamed of what Monster Hunter could have been if they tried as hard as they could... well we finally got to find out. It's amazing.
Taunky	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Taunky/	Not bad, can't say I've been experiencing all of the errors that others have been encountering, but I guess that's just my phenomenal luck. The graphics are great, controls are surprisingly simple on PC (controller support too if you prefer to use one). The only things I can nitpick on are the mouse acceleration, motion blur and the constant need to restart your game after making any graphical changes in your settings. I'm playing on a 1920x1200 monitor (16:9) and I have little black bars located on the top and bottom of my screen, hope those get fixed within the upcoming updates. Lastly, I'm playing on a GTX 1050Ti and i5 4670k and get an average of 45-60 FPS. Just be sure to turn off Volumetric Rendering.Otherwise, it's a great game. Definitely recommended to anyone who has enjoyed it on console.

doorslap	Not Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094713228/	Just do yourself a favor and don't buy this game. You lag out of sessions every ten minutes so playing with friends is not an option. Follow what the reviews say and don't pay 60 dollars on a unfinished game.
vapecum	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/coolgoet/	Good game,  better port than most native PC games. Servers are hecked right now but that will probably solve itself.
Rastamonsta	Recommended	85.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DatGuyOverThere/	Extreamly great and streamlined introduction to the series for new players. The game runs perfectly beyond a few FPS issues on High with my GTX 1060 and I7 core. Some reoccuring issues for many people is the connections (which is nothing new, the PS4 inital launch was the exact same, espcially since its the 1.0 patch), and forceing cutscenes on people. That last point is pretty annoying in multiplayer but it is ONLY for the main assignments aka the story missions. after you finished low rank, cutscenes are sparse and very far between. Its almost comical how much I honestly forgot about cutscenes until I go back and help friends still in low rank.Beyond that, the combat is great, the mechanics and difficulty are incredibly rewarding, and Capcom have outdone themselves. I've played this for 160+ hours on PS4 and am enjoying the process all over again.

HellNKiller	Not Recommended	1.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016169325/	***BEWARE*** Can't play too long due to motion blur. And mouse is a bit clunky. For some people like me we get dizzy and nauseous with motion blur on any game and so we turn it off but there is no way to disable it. Also the mouse input is a bit clunky and dont think you can achieve mouse precision and snappiness like that of Dark Souls or similar RPG.Had to refund. May buy again and recommend if they fix those two important issues... 
Verb_๊	Recommended	190.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/verbsbp/	I don't really know how to feel about this game yet, there are alot of good and bad things about this game but for now I'm going to side with a recommend.The BAD:Very grindy, you will be spending alot of time gathering materials and killing mobs. The story is the generic "newbie will save the World" plot. Nothing new to see here.Voice acting is also in the typical bad video game style that usually plagues these type of games.High learning curve with unclear tutorials.Cutscenes not skippable (as far as I know, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).Chat system is just plain dumb and borderline unusable.Connectivity issues.IN BETWEEN:Boss fights can feel a bit linearToo many optional questsBattle fluidityThe GOOD:A huge amount of customization for buildsA nice variety of weapons with different play stylesEnvironments can be used against BossesDifferent ways of taking down BossesSolo play is very challengingFighting, fighting & fightingConclusion: This game shines where it needs to and falls flat in everything else. Hunting Bosses and customizing your character into some Godly Hunter is all that really matters in a game like this and thankfully it mostly got it right. As you see above I wrote "battle fluidity" in "IN BETWEEN" and that is because the mechanics at times, can feel a bit stiff and slow. I would prefer something like Vindictus' play style which is much more fluid BUT it is still good.Not going to mention graphical stuff since all the down voters have already mentioned all that.
wpxxxxx	Not Recommended	63.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198216432771/	It's 'self-defeating' game. You can't image that the game developer can not fix a problem after 7 days.

Sure it's not perfectly optimized, but it runs on my 5 year old okay-at-the-time laptop, so I'm really happy. It's a masterpiece gameplay-wise, if you think you'll like this game don't be scared by the steam ratings, it's fantastic (b`-`)b(old review)I'm mostly writing this to put in perspective all the negative reviews,I've had no startup issue with the game, no controller issues, no crash, no lag, no problemIt's a great port as far as I can tell, and a  fantastic game from what little I have played (b`-`)b
Kazeeleks	Not Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kazeeleks/	Game is fun, but online doesn't work. I can not recommend this game until it is fixed. It's been a while too, not sure what the devs are doing.

TheLordOfLordran	Recommended	289.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLordOfLordran/	The mixed reviews for this game are simply because of matchmaking issues and poor performance on low-end rigs; both understandably so. Aside from these issues, the game so far is stellar - would recommend even in its current state, tbh.
TheMasterofDoom	Recommended	159.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMasterofDooom/	This game is a really fun, good and awesome game. The gameplay is a lot of fun. The story is interesting. And it all looks really beautiful! It's fun to play with your friends and its one of my favorite games! But there are some downsides to the game as well. For example the game is very poorly optimized, for example it uses about 95 to about 100% of my CPU, while I'm running a GPU that's a GTX 1060 6GB. I know that's just a little above the recomended GPU, and my proccesor falls inbetween minimum and recomended requirements, but 95 - 100% that's just crazy! Also if you're looking to play story mode with your friends, don't bother, you have to have seen all cutscenes first, why they decided to do this is a complete mystery to me. Another thing that is really bad about this game is that it has very bad connection issues. Every 10 minutes or so, I get booted from a lobby. When I alt tab I can litterely see my Steam connecting and disconnecting... (which is prolly why everyone gets these annoying pop ups of people playing monster hunter world every 5 minutes. I have a connection speed over 200 Mbps, so trust me I don't have a terrible connection. Something is very, very wrong with this game. Also the fact that they haven't released a patch yet is beyond believe. Very bad rep for Capcom if you ask me.Note that even with all these issues I still think it's an amazing game, and in no way am I trying to discourage the devs to release more monster hunters onto the pc. The game just needs a good patch that fixes the optimization, performance, connection issues, and also the whole cutscene thing needs to be dropped, I just wanna play story quests with my friends!  For now I'd say I give it a 5/10 but if these prolbems are fixed, I'm willing to upgrade to a 9 or even 10/10 since its one of if not the most fav game I got at this moment, so at the end of the day I would still recomend it! I'm just trying to be fair and not be a complete fan boy that ignores issues, besides, being a bit criticism might only help improve the game, if devs would ever read this (which they prolly won't)

FairEnough	Recommended	32.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023099461/	I am really enjoying the game, the slow start is something you have to get past, but each time mechanics are added the game opens up a lot. Don't ignore the side quest and investigations, they can all help you get ahead if you are struggling.I personally have had no issues with multiplayer, there are annoying barriers to get into story missions but the rest works great

Han Daimond	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/handaimond/	For MHW veterans on consoles: This version has faster loading times compared to the consoles, you will be impressed.For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.MY BUILD CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHzVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAMRAM: 12 GBStorage: Hybrid HD-SSDAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLDFrame Rate (cap): 60.V-Sync: Off. I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. FPS cost: HIGHResolution Scaling: Low. The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. FPS cost: LOW.Texture Quality: 1024. Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. FPS cost: VERY LOW.Ambient Occlussion: Off. Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. FPS cost: MEDIUMVolume Rendering Quality: Off. This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.Shadow Quality: Low. The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. FPS cost: HIGHAnti-Aliasing: Off. I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. FPS Cost: MEDIUMLOD Bias: Low. This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.FPS cost: MEDIUM.Max LOD Level: No Limit. Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.FPS cost: LOW.Foliage Sway: On. I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.FPS cost: VERY LOW.Subsurface Scattering: On.I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.FPS cost: LOW Screen Space Reflection: Off.How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.FPS cost: MEDIUMAnisotropic Filtering: Off.The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.FPS cost: MEDIUMWater Reflection: On.I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.FPS cost: LOWSH Diffuse Quality: Low.There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.FPS cost: MEDIUM Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.FPS: LOWZ-Prepass: On.I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.FPS cost: LOWAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say "finish", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.
Woody Bobo	Recommended	130.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghost_turtle/	First Monster HunterIve been waiting for something like this for a long time.

It has some issues Ill get into, but I'm also gonna explain what it is, and why it’s so damn fun. So wtf is it then? In a nut shell, there are 5 big open worlds/maps. These maps have huge monsters that you have to track down, kill, and harvest their glorious innards. You yourself do not level up. You’ll pick from 1 of 14 weapons (which is like your class, and you can switch em out as well if you wanna try others) and craft better weapons and armor from the parts you farm from monsters. You have a central hub (Astera) you’ll probably spend a lot of your time in, running side missions, while also progressing through the story and unlocking new maps, monsters, and adding/upgrading beneficial NPC hubs  within Astera. There’s so much content in this game it’s ridiculous. Things will start out slow, confusing and pretty damn difficult. You’ll prob have to google some sh*t and some of the fights, especially your first time going in, can last up to 30 minutes. You’ll have to learn the fights, learn the environments, learn your weapon, and learn what items you’ll need to bring. You craft almost everything in the game, from the coatings on your arrows, food, traps, to different potions for different situations. Everything is harvestable from the world; plants, nuts, animals, bugs, fishing, etc.As you progress through the story you’ll go up in Hunter Rank. The story itself is pretty much one long tutorial and as you complete story missions your Hunter Rank goes up, allowing you to take on stronger monsters as you become more powerful.You can play the entire game SP or MP. For me I would say 60-70% of my time has been spent playing with RL friends. This is were the fun and the problems come in.As of right now MHW has a pretty bad connection problem. From what Ive read, it’s worse for people who try and run match making exclusively. Me and my friends alone, we have connection issues but it’s not nearly as bad as others are reporting. I'm not saying the problem doesn’t exist, but for us its not unplayable.   Honestly it has varied day-to-day. Some days are worse than others. When it does happen, it literally take 5-10 seconds to reconnect. Sh*t can be frustrating at times, especially mid fight, but it’s not something that's constantly happening to us.Another thing, when you’re out on a hunt, you can send up an “SOS”. If you or someone else needs a part from a certain monster, they can respond to this sos and now you have a party of 4 going after the same target. This is the only way I play MP when not playing with friends, and again, I haven’t had a terrible experience with it. It has issues like the rest of the game’s connection issues but nothing as broken as Ive read in various forums. I have never tried to connect to match making so I cant comment on that outside what others are saying. There are currently 2 patches Capcom have been testing that are showing up in steamdb. I should also note that I usually dont play until after 7pm est.Other user complaints have been about performance. Again, maybe I’m just lucky. There are reportedly fixes but I haven’t had to do anything. 980ti/i5 4670k/latest Nvidia driver and I’m running 50-60 fps mid-high settings @2560x1440. I do get dips in the 40s but again, nothing game breaking, not for me at least.So thats pretty much it. Ive had a sh*t ton of fun running through the game with friends. Ive not played a good MP game in awhile and this game definitely hits the spot. There is just so much stuff to do, goals to set on what you wanna do next, helping each other out and so on. The above issues are from my personal experience and in no way am I saying those problems don’t exist. It’s a f*cking fantastic game that’s unfortunately getting review bombed due to Capcom’s slow (or almost lacking I should say) response.Connection UpdateOn 22 Aug, the same day I posted this review, Capcom patched the game. The patch was intended to reduce connection issues for folks while they continued to iron it out. Ive had about 30 hrs play time since, and have honestly had 0 connection issues, playing as I do, mentioned in the review. Playing with friends in our own lobbies, or running SOS missions. I have had 0 disconnects, 0 MW errors. Every single MP mission Ive started with friends or ran in SOSs since the patch has ended without a single connection drop. Some people are still reporting issues with match making or joining random lobbies. I cant comment on these issues since I dont ever join them.

Carnival.Corpse	Recommended	297.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/carnival_corpse/	Simply put, if you like the essence of grinding, then, you'll love the game in general. If you are only here to finish the story, then, it can be achieved without much grinding but keep in mind that, the story of Monster Hunter World is there only for the sake of being there; it's nothing extraordinary & shouldn't be your only reason to buy the game. That being said, grind is a must if you want to venture beyond the story & lust for some of the best gears & late monsters in the game.Now, the core strength of this game undoubtedly lies in the various monsters that lurks around the world. Monsters are effing brutal, each with their own distinct characteristics & abilities. Each & every of them feels like a boss fight. Preapre to spend good 10-15 mins(or even more) to take down a monster as they are quite tanky but the pleasure of besting them surely feels incredible.Apart from the monsters, the gameplay mechanic is solid as rock, coupled with the gorgeous ambience. The game sounds good, looks better, plays best. Total of 14 different types of weapons with skillsets, playstyles & combos that's unique from one another. Freaking tons of badass looking armors, deep customization system & crafting options are at your disposal to make your life easy when you take on those mystical creatures of doom.If you want to solo only, albeit surely possible, it may get a bit difficult or tedious. Best played with mates of course, and, the multiplayer system is being implemented in such a fluid way that you can join others(& vice versa) very easily without any hassle.No server issues anymore as well.Only gripe that I have is that joining the story quest in multiplayer isn't as seamless as joining those optional quests. I had to reach a certain point(cutscenes) of every story related missions & only after that my friends could join which made my experience a bit disjointed. Also, some quests where I had to search for monster tracks felt really exhausting & monotonous beacuse I had to return to hub & come again repeatedly to search for it to fill the bar.So, overall, I would recommend this game if grinding is your cup of tea as you'll be battling with the same monsters again & again for those exotic loots. If not, I would still recommend it to buy with your friends to experience some epic monster fights in co op, but, on sale.

Han Daimond	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/handaimond/	For MHW veterans on consoles: This version has faster loading times compared to the consoles, you will be impressed.For newcomers: BEWARE. It still has some issues that I will explain in a moment.This review was specifically made for those who have a low-end PC. I want to share my actual specs and current graphic setting to try and reach 1080p 60fps.MY BUILD CPU: AMD FX-8350 Eight-Core 4.00GHzVideo Card: AMD Radeon R7 370 Series 4GB VRAMRAM: 12 GBStorage: Hybrid HD-SSDAs you can tell, it's not impressive, something Low-Mid for today standards.GRAPHIC SETTINGS IN MONSTER HUNTER WORLDFrame Rate (cap): 60.V-Sync: Off. I rather tweak some settings with my Radeon software to try and fix the V-Sync, so I left AMD FreeSync on just in case and worked so far. The thing is, the built-in V-Sync in the game is very taxing. FPS cost: HIGHResolution Scaling: Low. The difference is noticeable between Low/Med/High, but the fps jump is kinda noticeable as well, specially in open areas (which is VERY common in the game). Since I'm playing on a 49" HDTV from a distance I can't tell much of a difference, so I leave it in Low. FPS cost: LOW.Texture Quality: 1024. Tested on lower values but hardly see any difference... until cutscenes showed up. Close ups also shows the degraded quality on textures, fortunately FPS is stable at max. FPS cost: VERY LOW.Ambient Occlussion: Off. Adds more detail on the environment, but I currently suffer from FPS drop even if leaving it on low. FPS cost: MEDIUMVolume Rendering Quality: Off. This is it, the bane of the FPS. Console users will recognize it as the fog, the one to blame all those fps drops; it adds more detail in the areas with all the lightning and stuff, but you can't see past the fog sometimes. This is no Nintendo 64, so no need to leave it on. FPS Cost: EXTREMELY HIGH.Shadow Quality: Low. The shadows in the game are already good; sure you will see some low quality shadows cast from the characters, but it definitely won't bother you, also you will save a lot of FPS. FPS cost: HIGHAnti-Aliasing: Off. I personally override the settings with Radeon settings, I use AMD's AA 8xEQ with Multisampling AA Method and it does a better job than the game with their own settings, which makes blurry edges, specially FXAA. Jaggies can be seen, but doesn't bother me that much. FPS Cost: MEDIUMLOD Bias: Low. This defines how detailed the objects are from a distance. I generally switch between low and medium, but the drop in FPS is kinda noticeable.FPS cost: MEDIUM.Max LOD Level: No Limit. Will switch between -1 and No Limit, but it does bother me the lack of detail in objects sometimes, so I leave it in No Limit, also, it doesn't punish my FPS that hard.FPS cost: LOW.Foliage Sway: On. I want the game to look good and alive. Static foliage is not good, nor alive.FPS cost: VERY LOW.Subsurface Scattering: On.I like to see very detailed skin on characters, definitely looks bad without it, specially in cutscenes.FPS cost: LOW Screen Space Reflection: Off.How objects reflect the environment. FPS altered if leaving it on. You can hardly tell the difference in quality.FPS cost: MEDIUMAnisotropic Filtering: Off.The detail of the terrain from some angles. You will not notice the difference.FPS cost: MEDIUMWater Reflection: On.I honestly can't remember if this was on in the PS4, but I liked the detail. FPS may vary.FPS cost: LOWSH Diffuse Quality: Low.There is this thing in the game where objects that are very close to you - more specifically, between your hunter, and the camera - get diffused, transparent and leave some dots all over the object. Supposedly, you can try to remove the dots by making them blurrier with this option, but it's very taxing on FPS, so I leave it on Low.FPS cost: MEDIUM Dynamic Range: 64-Bit. Left on 32-Bit and didn't like the colors, fortunately not taxing.FPS: LOWZ-Prepass: On.I honestly have no idea what this is about, even if the game tells you. Had no issues with FPS drops, so I left it On.FPS cost: LOWAfter all that, I can review the game for what it is, but a lot of comments here already explained what it is about, how does it feel, what works, what doesn't; so I'm gonna try my best to do a brief review.Had already spent 350+ hours on PS4 with Hunter Rank 179; I personally love this game, it's one of my favorites of the year so far. Haven't played a MonHun title before, but I can tell there were a lot of improvements, like real open areas and be able to move while drinking potions.The game consists on hunting monsters to carve them to get rare materials to build weapons, armor, and accessories to go hunt more powerful and dangerous monsters. Rinse and repeat.Character customization is deep enough, you may spend more than an hour trying to create your prefered hunter, and palico. (Palico are the little cat helpers that hunt with you)You have 14 different weapons to choose from, and it's fairly balanced.It has no PvP, the game is about hunting monsters, not other hunters.It has a story mode but I've find it not that engaging personally.It has multiplayer, you can play with other 3 players in a single quest and do whatever you want in the area: scavenging for bones, items, gems, and of course, hunting monsters.You have a HUB where you can improve your hunter with lots of stuff, and more options are unlocked as you progress during the main story.There's also a gathering hub that no one uses because there's no smithy, nor botany, nor melder, nor other shops that you will use a lot in the main tradeyard hub in Astera; the only reason you would go to the gathering hub is to do exclusive Arena quests. You can finish the game under 80-120 hours, depending on your pacing. But I would say "finish", because a lot of content opens up afterwards, also the team releases free DLC monsters and events and hopefully will continue to do so throughout the year.Now, it has some issues that people are currently facing and let me tell you, THEY WERE THE SAME IN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. More spefically, about the disconnections. And guess what? As of today, seems that issue was fixed... at least on the PS4. I had no idea why it happens on PC, but the port job is not perfect. You will face with random disconnections all the time, so get used to it until they fix the problem. Disconnecting from a room doesn't kick you out of the game though.You will notice a little bit of lag on the controls, specially when approaching to the chest when arriving into a quest, your hunter will crouch instead of opening the chest. It's a minor detail, but it bothers me sometimes.Some users have issues with FPS. nVidia users suggest NOT to update your video card drivers, but updates fixed my problem in AMD Radeon.Some users are complaining about the keyboard-mouse controls, I would suggest to use a controller instead if you're in that position. I currently use a DualShock 4 paired with my PC via Bluetooth and works great. The only issue is that the game doesn't recognize it as a PS4 controller and will show you an Xbox One button layout instead, since it's an Xbox One port.Speaking of Xbox, I tried a wired Xbox 360 controller to play the game and works perfectly.Graphics are great, music is great, gameplay is satisfying, it has a LOT of replayability, even after finishing the main story.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into, I would definiltely recommend Monster Hunter World.If you're looking for a good co-op game to invest your time into WITHOUT disconnections, I would recommend to wait a bit before buying Monster Hunter World.Better yet, I would recommend to visit the discussions section to get more info about the game and see if you're convinced into buying it.So, personally, I recommend this game for its gameplay and replayability, but maybe NOT in the current state with random disconnections, it definitely can be better.

floob	Recommended	229.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/grombledorf/	For those who read or have experienced losing their save due to killing Xeno'Jiiva, from Reddit:There is no Xeno save corruption bug.We can all stop posting about this and please go into your negative reviews mentioning this and remove it.There is no save corruption bug from the final boss. It is now confirmed.The issue is somehow the PC's affected by the "bug" are missing required standard codecs to play the cutscene.Once the game autosaves after the boss has been defeated, it attempts to load the cutscene and crashes.The autosave's next call is to load that cutscene, so it appears "corrupted" when you load because your game will crash.This can be tested by viewing the palico tool video's in your house. If you have a "corrupted save" from the xeno fight, you will crash when viewing the palico tool videos.If you crash, you are missing or have corrupted codecs.You need to download and install this:https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/mediafeaturepackorhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/web-media-extensions/9n5tdp8vcmhs?activetab=pivot:overviewtabApparently windows 7 gets pointed to this version.

Dr. Ted "Crazy Legs" Nelson	Recommended	112.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/drtedcrazylegsnelson/	I'd like to stop playing, but I have some more weapons and armor to craft. A few more optional quests to do. A few more investigations to get more monster parts. Oh, that armor looks good on my Palico, but I really want to make *this* one. Oh hey, let's try a different weapon - wow, this is like playing a totally different game. I wonder what *that* other weapon is like?I really need to go to bed. I have work tomorrow.But I have to fight this monster at least one more time to get that weapon I want...not to mention that *other* monster for the parts for the new weapon I'm using. I'm having a hard time beating that guy solo, but I can drop into a multiplayer game and me and three other strangers will kick the crap out of it.I can put this down anytime I want.

Helios Leinheart	Recommended	129.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/heliosleinheart/	What a MASSIVE change to the Monster Hunter formula. Anybody who is a long time MH player will immediately notice how everything is more convenient. Whetstone is now an infinite use item that's always in your inventory, so no need to buy or collect them. No need for bug nets anymore either, since you actually collect visible bugs now. Pickaxes, those are gone too. Just get your ore and move on. No more having to paintball monsters to track them. Now there's a new system of tracking through footprints and leavings. As for hot drinks and cool drinks, cool drinks are only needed in very specific situations. Not for an entire zone. And hot drinks, I don't think they're even in the game anymore. Hell, there's even fast travel now. Now that's an aspect of "modernization" in game design that I can get behind. This is absolutely a reboot for the series. There's so much improved here from the old games that I would have a really hard time going back. Monster Hunter World is the new formula, and I hope it's here to stay. (The online is kinda wonky right now, but it seems to be getting better lately. All things considered, I can live with a dropped connection once in awhile.)
TactiCat	Recommended	57.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DaemonQueeN/	Tips for a Zen MH Experience:Steam > Settings > Controller > General Controller Settings > Make sure your controller type is checked off. Restart Steam.I hear Mouse and Keyboard has some response time jank, but you should probably be playing with a controller anyway.If CPU issues, turn off volumetric fog, set FPS limit to 60. Turn off Z-Prepass, should speed up processing. I also have Subsurface Scattering, Screen Space Reflection, Water Reflection off. At this point my PC feels like a potato, most other settings on medium.Play in "Borderless Fullscreen Mode" as alt-tabbing out of Fullscreen will cause crashes, just save yourself the headache. Runs fine in Borderless with no issues.I have had zero issues playing with Friends. We've been using Session ID to join each other and firing SOS in story missions once they let you do that. Just takes a little verbal communication of what you're doing, use Discord. We either take turns choosing Investigations, or just elect someone party leader to choose for us.Makes me sad to see the reviews so Mixed, so I had to stop playing the game to write this up. Steam is for some reason incorrect, it's only logged 18.1 hours as of writing this, but my actuall game log time says 32:28:35 on main + 1:03:30 for the second character I made. (That's about how long the intro takes before you can play with friends.)I am having a blast with this game. I didn't play other Monster Hunter games in the past, but I did play the hell out of Dragon's Dogma. A lot of these mechanics feel familiar, from the UI design to companion characters, and how bosses and elemental effects work. Supposedly World drifts from the MH forumula a tad and I guess that's right, but being like DD isn't bad either. Feels more like an RPG than a pure Boss Run game, which I prefer personally.I'm on track to clock hundreds of hours into this game. It's all I can think about while at work or out and about. How to tackle the next monster, what gear I need to build, what materials I need to gather to prep. The environments are beautiful so far, I love the monster variety. I love the way they fight over territory. I love the amount of weapon variety, there's all types for every kind of player. I really think it's worth a buy. My only con is that cosmetically I have little choice of my armor selection, as skills/talents are tied to specific peices of gear. So you end up looking like a mishmash clown. I am hoping they add more layered outfit choices (all that's available currently is the Samurai outfit), because they aren't seeming like they're going to implement cosmetic item slots or let you dye the regular armor types, unfortunately. But even then, I am too distracted by what the monster is doing to worry about what I look like most of the time.

Meat-King©®	Recommended	221.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968514473/	 “To hunt successfully, you must know your ground, your pack and your quarry.” Monster Hunter World (MHW) is a third-person action game with light rpg elements developed and published by the company CAPCOM, who are also responsible for the creation of the Monster Hunter game series (2004). The original console version of MHW was released in January 2018, with a PC adaption in August 2018. Pro & contra: ++ Gameplay. Easy to learn, but hard to master. Each weapon (14+) demands a different tactical approach in combat. The various monsters have their own attack patterns, weaknesses and environments. Hunting and gathering facilitate the creation of better weapons and armour. This in turn allows for specialized equipment in order to hunt bigger beasts. + Level design. The different world areas are full of rich detail and offer plenty to discover. The flora and fauna provides an endless array of useful collectibles.+ Companion. Your feline sidekick can be customized, has some useful skills, and will support you in combat. Yet, the Japanese obsession with cats has been pushed to its extreme in this game.o Multiplayer. The flexible cooperative MP options let you play the numbers game to take down your adversaries. But the irregular disconnects will lead to rage inducing moments.- Story & characters. Boring Godzilla scenario threatening the invaders of the new world. Clichéd characters & silent protagonist. A fraction of the content is synchronized. Console based text progression.- PC adaption. Every action you take in this game beginning with the submenu navigation, over inventory management, down to drinking a potion - while being chased by a fire-breathing monstrosity - will remind you of its console roots. Little effort has been invested into the adaptive work for the PC version. Summary: Personally, I feel it deserves most of the praise it has received and I enjoy the gameplay immensely. The hunting and gathering culture represents the core element of the game, and it has been excellently executed. Nevertheless, it is being held back from being great by the suboptimal story-telling, PC adaption, and reoccurring server issues.Recommended for curious adventurers and people with a cat fetish. Achievements: Keep in mind that this game is a random number generated grind festival. Estimated time for 100 % completion: +200 hoursOffline achievements: 45Online achievements: 5
Dinnyforst	Recommended	469.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dicenaries-tech/	“In the aspect of ambitious Hunter and friendly Nyan”I want to talk about my aspect of game as overall experience. Although, there's some issues from PC porting, but it doesn’t hide the fact I still enjoy the game.Welcome, Rookies and Veterans Monster Hunter: World (MHW) is considered as fifth generation of Monster Hunter series developed by Capcom. You play as hunter, receive task to hunt or capture various monsters as they reward you their components for advanced weapons and armors. Unlike previous titles, MHW is designed to introduce new players with more casual gameplay and new mechanics, yet it still remains complex and challenge hunting as core gameplay in seamless environment. MHW is powered by MT framework game engine (same as Dragon’s Dogma, RE, DMC) with improve AI and Havok physics to simulate realistic experience and most alive world in the series. The Hunter’s Story The story takes place in part of New World. You play as a hunter of Fifth Fleet (customized via character creation), working on expedition to study the migration of Elder Dragons. The team first encounters Zorah Magdaros, one of massive Elder Dragon which motivates research team and hunter to track down Zorah as part of main campaign. Story is not always the strongest selling-point of the series. MHW did its best to create believable plot and backstory via high quality cutscenes and environment background. Overall, the story is quite enjoyable, even though it’s predictable, has weak character development, awkward moments (especially your assistant “Handler”), and bad lips sync.Simple Hunt, Endless Approach MHW gives you freedom of choice to approach the hunt. You start from basic hunting knowledge as the game constantly introduces new mechanics (tracking, gathering, traps, environmental advantage and much more). Lots of information and UI are thrown into screen, but it’s become handy once you get used to it.There are total 14 weapon types (11 melee and 3 ranges). Each weapon has different distinctive move set, combo, weakness, and strengths. It serves purpose and role of combat one way or another, yet allow player to find best weapon to fit their own playstyle. Landing hit always feel satisfied and weight from hard-hitting Greatsword to sky dancing move of Insect Glaive. One thing I would mention is combat in MH series encourages player to master their moves, position, timing, alongside with monster behavior. It’s something you’ve to get used to, as some weapon require higher skill than other, but reward very satisfied outcome. MHW also introduce “slinger” as sidearm, allow you to shoot various bullets type that you collect from environment or monster part. It has grappling hook to traverse faster or reach higher ground to mount the monster. Moreover, you also have “Palico” as cat-like companion to support you in various ways depended on its equipment which you can freely customize.The game features five main areas filled with different biomes and settings. From dense ancient forest to beautiful coral highlands, every sub-area is full of details and routes connected each other. You tracking targeted monster by collecting dropped samples to reveal their location and level up research point, allow you to track them more easily. Yet, those research points will be used for various supporting feature such as plant greenhouse, crafting Palico gears, trading random materials, including information of monster. Hunting is MHW very dynamic and fluid. Gameplay also emphasize on environment interaction and vertical combat. Taking advantage of high ground to mount on monster or kick Paratoads to paralyze big monster is always amusing. Sometimes, you encounter random turf war between two or more monsters. Let them fight while you hiding in bush. Breaking monster part for specific loot and capture when target shows sight of weakness for better rewards. All are just a small part of MHW experience. Thanks to very smooth character movement and monster animation alongside with responsive keyboard control (although some default setting need to be tweaked). You can also team up with other 3 players for chaotic fun experience (like launching a friend to make aerial combo using your hammer or gang up monster with trap and barrel bomb) as the monster become tougher and aggressive based on party size.Progress, Unlock, Enhance After each quest, you can choose to freely explore in Expedition mode or back to main village “Astera” where it serve as main hub of various side features to upgrade your hunter, crafting, create meal for buff, receive special task, decorate your home with capture small creatures, or meet other players in Gathering hub. Every loot and quest rewards you with new special gadget, gear recipes, and unlockable features makes you’ll feel like constantly improved. The smithy allows you to customize gear, each weapon has different tree build and armor set has its weakness and strength. Yet, you can use mixed skill from armor set, depending on what monster you’re facing as the element damage and ailments do matter on higher rank monsters.On a side note, UI and inventory system could be a bit messy and confused for first time, but it major improved game flow once you get used to as player can customize loadout, wishlist, name, guild card, and quick crafting which is very useful during real-time hunting.Sound of New World While most of voice acting is decent and lip-sync performance is hit-and-miss, MHW has amazing soundtracks and ambient musics. They're memorable, film symphony orchestra, and motivated during hunt as it play dynamically on certain situation. Most of sound effects are solid. Large monster give you terrified roar and distinctive to define their identity.Ending is just The Beginning MHW still offers more end-game contents after main campaign, introducing Tempered Monsters, extended upgrading features (augment, jewel, limited removal), and more upcoming free contents same as console version. Side optional investigation, arena time attack, or participate event hunts. Moreover, you also unlock special quests on certain hunter rank. At this point, you might ask yourself or set your own goal if you enjoy hunting more hardened monsters over and over for specific upgrade components. You’re grinding for maximize your gear and RNG can be painful or enjoy random hunt for pure fun. The choice is yours and it’s still worth even though you only play main story.Stumble in Technical Issues It’s first time of MH Team to work in PC port. The performance varies on different builds and drivers. Although I had no crash issue on low-spec PC, the optimization itself is very decent. The some textures are slightly sharpened than console version, there are some blurry textures and overused effect, it also lack graphical option to disable in-game DOF and motion blur. Huge particle effect on some area or specific attack can kill FPS due to poorly optimized MT framework engine and how the game function which impact on CPU usage. Inconsistent network connection can sometimes present in prime time. But Capcom manages to finally resolve critical connection issue which I really appreciated (September patch). At this point, MHW becomes much more stable as the developers deploy patches from time to time.Verdict MHW is designed for specific audience. People who enjoy hunting, collecting, crafting, tracking progression as based formula. High-risk, high-reward combat but improved accessibility in most ways. It’s not perfect, but it’s great way to introduce new comer to the series, but still offer challenge and fun factor to veterans. At this point, it’s best to find out by yourself and I believe MH Team could deliver QOL update and free content for better experience from now on.I hope you fine this review helpful and enjoy hunting~
BriskPanda	Recommended	110.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BriskPanda/	Fun game you enjoy fighting big monsters or boss like battles, it also has 4 player Coop supportThe first two hours of the game are mostly tutorials and character customization so I would reccomend looking at Youtube reviews so you know what you're geting into.Also turn off Volumetric Rendering to significantly boost your FPS if you seem to have trouble running the game.[Update/Response to current steam reviews]I see a ton of people negatively reviewing the game on technical issues, acting as if the game is bad or unplayable yet still playing it for several hours.There is currently an issue with playing on Mouse and Keyboard because the game emulates a joystick instead of using raw input from your mouse. Capcom has addressed this issue and stated that they are working on a patch to fix it. (Currently there is a partial fix though f you go to steam/steamapps/common/monster hunter world/ open the config file there's a setting that says MouseBaseSpeed=2.000000. Change this number so that max feels quicker Example number .2)Also I have noticed that a lot of the negative reviews are mostly about technical issues such as there is a lack of DoF slider, or that you can't disable motion blur (turn off AA and it will go away).The current multiplayer issues are likely going to die down a week after release
SeductiveShrew	Recommended	97.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067034623/	PROS: -Able to hunt monsters.-Able to hunt monsters with friends (when you figure out how to decently connect to other people) -New Gear-Tons of Collectables-14 main weapons to choose from.-Cool Cat who aids you. (can customize him too)-Seeing monsters engage with other monstersCONS:-Multiplayer is a bit of hit or miss. Random disconections for me and my friend. -No real guide.-Not completely fullscreen.(some very slight blackspace) -No way to adjust the mic volume. Its soo quiet. With that being said I have sunk hours into this and I just got it yesterday. Very fun. If they can adjust the above a bit this will be a must have. Saw a lot of mixed reviews so I just wanted to chime in. Hope this helps.

Alex	Recommended	61.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Monkeywithbiggun/	Info for MHW on PC:- Make sure you disable ‘volume rendering’ in your graphics settings for a huge FPS boost (literally adds 20fps)- Connecting to friends lobbies is done through steam friends list- Squads are actually Steam Groups so be sure to make one with your buds~@Strippin on twitter
KRAUSER-SAMA	Recommended	92.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073971245/	 The Short of it Pros:+Combat is very fluid and focuses on the use of combos.+Awesome hunts, each hunt truly feels like a boss fight+Incredible, beautiful environments and monsters to fight +Diverse, varying weapons to accommodate different play styles+You get the bestest, most adorable cat companion who will be there for you through thick and thin.+Food looks great and is also cooked by cats!Cons:-Optimization isn't quite as good as one would hope...-Denuvo is reportedly causing a lot of issues for other users-Have randomly disconnected from online despite my wired connection being fine-Keyboard+Mouse controls aren't great The Good (More in-depth) +Gameplay: The combat in Monster Hunter World is its main attraction, and does so fantastically. Combat is incredibly fluid and heavily centered around performing combos to maximize your damage output. On the surface all looks and behaves well, but the game in general is quite the resource hog (focused on more below). Be that as it may, the game's combat in itself both looks and feels great, and so comes off as a positive point.+Hunts: This is the main thing you will be doing in the game, and I can happily say that each new creature you hunt is enjoyable, in the sense each hunt feels similar to a boss fight, as it should. Fighting each new creature, figuring out their attack patterns and weaknesses is what makes each new hunt so thrilling, and MHW does just that with this release.+Graphics: The game looks great, simple as that. Each creature you meet and the expansive environments to travel in are stunning.+Variety: You have a total of 14 weapon classes to choose from. Each providing their own sets of benefits and demerits, and allowing you to take on different means of approaches for a hunt. These varying classes basically allow at least one fit for any hunter to mesh with their preferred playstyle.+Cats: Your Palico companion, and chefs, are simply adorable. That's really all I want to say, but your companion in specific is very helpful and still gives you a partner if running solo. Your Palico can assist in a variety of manners be it in damage, defense, or restoration.  The Bad -Optimization isn't the best, more modest rigs are going to have a tougher time of running it (my 1080 barely passes 60 fps on high in 1440p, even when out of combat). UPDATE: After turning off volumetric rendering for the fog in the advanced settings I'm getting between 90 - 100 fps on high. Hard to say how much of an increase lower end rigs will experience so I'll leave this up as a "buy with caution" point.UPDATE 2: According to hardware monitor my i7 8700k almost reached 100 degrees celcius, this is NOT okay. Yes the game is more cpu intensive, but to the extent that my hardware is well past the threshold any CPU should reasonably take shows that the game is more poorly optimized than initially thought.-Denuvo: people seem to be experiencing a lot of issues and from what I'm seeing it seems mostly due to the anti tamper denuvo in the game. If it's as bad as it seems, you may want to make sure your computer is compatible which, if it isn't, will suck for more than a few I'm sure (knew there was denuvo but didn't interfere with my experience, guess I was lucky). -Online: It's only kinda functional, at first playing with my friend was a bit confusing due to how lobbies worked but after figuring it out we got to hunt together, BUT we have experienced connectivity issues in the game and randomly disconnected from one another. As we were continuously communicating through discord, it's evident that this isn't an issue with our actual connection to our internet.-Controls: I've personally opted to use a controller from the start, and have no real complaints about the controls. But experimentation with the KB+M felt very off. The mouse in particular behaves like a joystick rather than a mouse for aiming with the cursor, and causes for some incredibly awkward movements. There doesn't seem to be any way around this either. I'd recommend a controller if possible for other buyers, but this will come as a bummer to many if not (unless this is later fixed of course).Conclusion:My first real Monster Hunter game in the series and I love it, recommended to all, newcomers and veterans alike. Will update more if need be as I play through the PC version.Additional info: After playing through the game a bit more, more issues have sprouted up. The game works and I am indeed enjoying it, but there are many who are going through worse due to these stated issues. As such, I advise caution to purchasing this game immediately, it may be best to bide your time and see how the game is patched.Follow our curator page, OCG-Curations if you like and want to see more reviews like this one. 
Litterally Hitler	Recommended	185.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198252315246/	Wow! this game is so bad at marketing! they said it was a videogame, but its a time machine! it will transport you from 10 pm to 3 am.
VoiceActress	Recommended	125.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198078292590/	This game currently has a few glaring issues but if you're new to the Monster Hunter franchise like I was, this is a game worth buying no matter what. I've clocked 95 hours over six days and I wholeheartedly think this is a wonderful game to experience even with all of the problems. I'll write this review mostly in the context of players that did not play the PS4 version, and I will treat this mostly as a game for newer players that are unsure about buying this game. Bear in mind that Capcom has done a messy job with the port as a whole, but the game itself is a masterful experience. The Pros: -Monster hunting is amazing. You legitimately have to think your way through as you progress through the game. -14 choosable weapons, and every weapon is viable for the most part to progress through the story. Some weapons naturally have an advantage over certain mobs over others.-Progression is wonderful, and there are trees to each weapon that you can pick. Some weapons are unique and customizable. -Beat monster, then use monster bones to fight bigger monster. That's the joy of monster hunter! -Solo gameplay is amazing, and in my opinion the way to experience MH the first time, especially when youre facing new monsters. -Very detailed world design, 5 unique areas each sporting unique monsters to hunt.-Diverse skills that each armor sports, making proper builds an actual thing. Build does matter, and will increase your damage!-T-Rex that breathes fireThe Meh: -Story is interesting to some extent, but hard to really get invested in.-Characters are unnamed. They're literally called "Handler" and the like. -No glamour/transmog system, so you can't cover an ugly looking armor that might be good for your build.-Lack of content after completing your own goals, and not currently caught up with PS4. -Iffy control schemes, simpler weapons like the Bow won't mind it at all, but weapons with more button presses will want a controller. The Cons:-Multiplayer is BROKEN for most people.  D/C from my own session even though I'm in Discord fine! -The game is not very well optimized, a few particle heavy bosses in the very endgame will absolutely tank your fps, even my friends with good rigs have complained about it.-The game renders entire maps together, so some of the worlds you'll experience worse performance because of size and complexity. -DenuvoIs this game worth $60 to you? Maybe not, but I had a wonderful experience and I would certainly recommend at least playing through this game if you have never played a MHW game. The people who have given negative reviews are correct in that the optimization and connection issues are absolutely horrendous, but many of them also speak from the point of view of someone who has already played the PS4 version and expect better of Capcom. If you're a new player that has never played a MH game, you MUST play this game.
zlatanfish	Recommended	216.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197967267718/	online works fine since latest patch
Astrobia	Not Recommended	123.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AstrobiaBlack/	Amazing game but again we have either a lazy port from Capcom or evidence they just do not understand the PC platfrom.Key issues you can expect:- No option to disable DOF- No option to disable Motion blur- No option to disable or adjust Bloom- No option to adjust FOV- No option to rebind buttons for Controllers- Very limited Antialising- Limited granulatiy in other graphics settings- No 21:9 Screen Ratio support- Bugged Full Screen support- Bug of High Resolution Textures not loading at max settings- Bug of Screen Space Reflections not displaying but still consuming system resources- Bugged DOF Distance Detection causing erratic blur on objects that should be in focus- Rediculous number of Menu Layers- Bad Connection Stability causing frequent drop outs and disconnections from server even when playing solo- Awkward Multiplayer Lobby arrangement- Bonus complaint, No Nargacuga :-POther than that the game is fantastic. But given the console version sold millions of copies and they had an extra 9 months of development to get the port right there is really no excuse for any of the above. Plus connection issues will ruin your multiplayer experience... And it is Monster Hunter World, not monster hunter sit alone in the corner. Capcom has the money and resources to fix this with minimal investement. They can have a thumbs up when they do so.Edit (20/9/18): A recent patch has removed this item from the list:- No option to disable Mouse AccelerationSo at least we are seeing some progress and it is a big ticket item. But it took them a month, nothing else has been touched and a notable number of people are reporting crash on launch issues after installing the patch. But it is something. Hopefully the level of support will increase as we go forward.

Avian Kinetic Aerodynamics	Recommended	311.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ladyscootaloo/	Pros,- It's Monster Hunter. Combat joy. See below.- Fights that require learning and improvement.- Progression through gear *and* personal experience+skill.- It looks great. (even at low settings)- Plenty of weapon styles.- Monster Hunter language for speech available. 10/10.- All weapons are great. Except Longsword because ♥♥♥♥ everyone using it. Including me.- High variety and decent depth of tools and their respective uses.- Lots of gear building.- Inspiring soundtrack.- Long grind and lots of stuff to do.(the stuff below was added because a dumbass made a good point)- You have a pet cat that sort of talks. It fights with you in duos/solos if you allow them.- Cats have armour and weapons.Cons : - There are bad players, beware. (reviews about how the monster 'predicts' your attacks)- There are bad players hoping you can wail on monsters just because you dodged.- Some of these players did not just give up and are still playing, BEWARE.- This game is not for potato PCs. Seriously.- Low settings can take awhile to get used to. (still looks alright to me,  but it is a bit of a downgrade from high/medium)- The AI is pretty scary if you're not prepared. (If you want a punishing beat-em-up, go to Dark Souls, instead.)- There is a long grind. It's what this game is about. Grind for parts, make stuff to grind for more parts.- Disconnection issues may have been improved upon, but are still there. (possibly caused by Steam, rather than MHW?)- Again, this game is *seriously* taxing on one's system. Potatoes be warned.Summary- I am having way too much fun.- Soloing is easier, don't let scrubs mislead you on this. They're just bad. Multiplayer is dealing with a harder AI to read and way more HP to break through with reliance on teammates who may or may not be good.- This is not a game for people who believe that if you outplay the monster by dodging, you get free hits. All you did was dodge. Now find your damn opening, because dodging me spitting at you doesn't mean I can't still punch you in the teeth.

♡ Bri ♡	Recommended	53.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thebriwashere/	I highly recommend THE GAME in general, but I do not recommend buying it here just yet. There are a lot of problems going on. For example, the game takes up %100 of my GPU & CPU. That means I basically can not have anything else running in the background. Even music buffers. I have way higher then the "minimal" requirements they list here, and my game could hardly run on the lowest settings. Now if you only have a PC and really wanna play this, me and a few others did some research and found out a few things you can do to help with the problems their settings are having, that should last you until they actually fix it.You need to completely turn off all of the following settings:~V-Sync~Volume Rendering Quality~Anti-Aliasing~Z-PrepassYou also need to do the following:~Play in "Borderless Window" instead of full screen.~Set your Frame Rate to "60".When I found these fixes out, I was then able to play on the highest settings (minus the above obviously) and have things like music, Twitch, Discord, Pandora, or YouTube running in the background.Now the game itself is amazing. I have it for both PS4, and PC. Amazing graphics, amazing fighting, amazing armor, amazing hunting techniques, just... amazing. I very much recommend playing it.

¨°º✪GødzBlazƸ✪º°¨	Recommended	459.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Godzblaze/	I've been waiting for a Monster Hunter world to finally come to a platform i own. So far beside the optimisation and unstable connection, i am literally in love with the game. I will play it for a very long time and I cannot recommend this enough if you are interested in this kind of gameplay loop ( prep , hunt , craft , repeat ). But beware , you need a pretty decent PC to run this game until it get more optimized and the connection error can get really annoying.A Great Game but a Bad Port unfortunatly.
uhruhri	Recommended	296.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/uhruhri/	As for now other than technical issues, I really can't give bad review for this game. I really hope Capcom will still fix it ASAP despite my positive feedback.What I enjoy from Monster Hunter World despite this is my first game of the franchise are :- Good difficulty progression, at first you will meet normal-hard version of the monster then harder version then hardest version of the monster. All in good step progression.- A lot of things to do, not counting the grind for the end game which really optional. There are alot of things to try, whether you want to collect all armor, trying all weapon, collect all palico's gadget.- Co-op is really optional. As for me I always try everything solo first because of the challenge then after If I want to co-op I can hunt with  my friend or just use "SOS" feature to help random people- Good for Casual player and Hardcore player. Casual can just play the game as it is until reach tempered version of monster, both solo and co-op. Hardcore can aim for min-maxing the equipment through endgame. It's really up to you.- Endgame Grinding is optional. Unlike MMO which something you need to do if you don't want lag behind. As for me once I beat all monster solo until tempered elder dragon I feel satisfied enough. I don't really attracted enough to find all decorations and augment to complete my gear set. I'm still gonna continue tho to try other weapon, but probably not as intense as usually I play.What I dissapointed from the game :- Lack of Raw Mouse Input. This is the only reason I don't try range weapon. I don't like playing range using controller, but when I try using K+M the mouse really feel weird. Alot of suggestion how to tweak but I really can't get it enjoyable. Capcom really need to fix this.- Texture bug. My rig is not the best, but for texture I usually can get the highest option. Despite that it's still not look too good- Network Issue. This is the only reason preventing people playing co-op and why it's worth to give negative feedback for this game. - Not enough explanation for some feature in the game unless console player told us. Yes I'm talking about radial menu customizationMixed feeling :- Amount of Monster, I feel it's good enough but after I read some of comment about number of monster in previous game I feel like MHW can get more too. Hope Capcom will add more monster other than the one they release in Console version

Twikle Sparlight	Recommended	70.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Twikle_Sparlight/	People are the biggest drama queens about this game.Monster Hunter: World is an excellent game.  It is a pretty game.  It's definitely a game for people with more powerful rigs.  If you have never played a Monster Hunter game in your life before, this is superb.  Even if you've played Monster Hunter games before and want to get back into the franchise, this game reinvents and does away with many annoying mechanics.  No more paintballs and no more loading into 12 different zones.  That's always nice.So, why is this game mixed?  Somewhat simple.  People don't understand how games these days work.Here's the lowdown on the mixed review.When the game launched on PC, it was met with a very unforgiving issue:  Multiplayer only worked when it wanted to at best.  You could never start this game with the expectation that you'd be playing with your friends.  Sometimes it worked, sometimes it didn't.  We had to try dozens of placebo fixes in the remote hope of ever possibly playing with our friends.Today, August 22, about two weeks post PC launch, this issue was patched.Now, instead of people changing their minds about this, they're angry it took two weeks.  I work quality assurance for a small company and I inspect developer work.  It is not unusual for something to take a full week to pass QA sometimes.  There is a lot of testing that has to go on and be reproduced that often goes underappreciated.  People are so used to day one patches that they don't realize that day one patches or patches that soon follow a product release are often things that have been caught by QA/Dev prior to launch and have been worked on before it actually hit.What I suspect happened with the connection issue is that it honestly went unnoticed until launch.  Granted, that's a pretty big problem to have go unnoticed, but sometimes things go through to production that maybe shouldn't.  Bugs happen.  It takes time to fix these bugs.  Two weeks isn't unreasonable for what seems to be a beguiling intermittent bug that can be observed, yet not reliably reproduced.  Even the large userbase of players that were so disgruntled couldn't find an extremely reliable way of reproducing it other than "It just happens" and "I can't connect at all."  Things like this can take a lot of work to try to figure out the underlying cause.  It's just a nice thing to have watched the SteamDB page show that their dev repositories were constantly being updated -- they were actively working on fixing it for the whole two weeks, not sitting around with their thumbs up their ♥♥♥♥♥♥s.Now, two weeks post launch.  Connection issue is fixed for the most part.  According to the devs, it's still occuring in some cases, but their fixes have reduced the frequency of it.  Chances are you won't see the effects of this review bomb go away, which is unfortunate.  Without this connection issue, I could see this game being at least in Very Positive territory.  Only very positive because there are still outstanding issues with the game's graphical issues.One thing you need to be very aware of is that Monster Hunter is a pretty game.  Many pretty games aren't very well optimized to run on all hardware.  This is very much the case with Monster Hunter.  Do your homework and look for the minimum spec, because this game is about as hard on your computer as an Ubisoft title.  Lots of horsepower is required to get this game running nice and pretty, but I've made it work on three different computers.  One with a 1050Ti and an i7-3770K; one with an i7-7700HQ and a 1070; and one with a Ryzen 1700X and a 1080.  The 1050 Ti needed to be put to low graphics settings at 1920x1080 to achieve a good, playable framerate, but I don't think it could manage a silky smooth 60 fps.  The 1070 machine can run the game beautifully at high settings with no real issues.  Perfect smoothness on the i7-7700HQ/1070 build was achieved by turning volumetric fog to low or none.  Finally, the Ryzen 1700X/1080 build managed just fine on max settings, though volumetric fog was turned down to help assist in certain frame spiking situations.With that said, your biggest enemy to performance will be the volumetric fog effect.  It looks pretty if that's what you're used to, but turn it to low if you want to keep it.  The difference is minimal, visually, but the FPS impact is very significant.  Turn if off if you don't like fog in the distance.Now, the last performance hitch of note is the lightning effects.  Heavy lightning effects occurring on screen, especially from player-based attacks, tend to drop frames for no understandable reason.  Avoid having more than 2 people in your party using lightning-based weaponry, or you'll start to get into unplayable framerate territory.  I have faith this issue will be patched in time, but as of the time of writing this on August 22, it's still ongoing.Finally, one last major gripe I'm sure you're going to see coming out of the bag of negative reviews is that the game uses Denuvo.  You'll hear all sorts of horror stories about it destroying solid state drives and killing your CPU performance.  It does no such thing, and such claims are unsubstantiated.  I will agree to the sentiment that most games I've played that run Denuvo DRM tend to hurt on the CPU performance side.  You will find that people have articles up about how Denuvo tanks performance, but you often find rebuttals about it.Point is, Denuvo sucks.  Maybe in a decade it could lock you out of the game if it goes under or support drops or whatever.  The bottom line is this:  You will not be playing Monster Hunter World in 10 years.  You just won't.  Games For Windows Live was dropped a long time ago, and some computer games 10 years back were still using it.  When is the last time you touched a GFWL game?  Very likely you haven't in the past few years.  Stop worrying about Denuvo maybe someday making this game unplayable.  When that happens, you'll have long moved on from this game.---Would that I had more space to write about the actual game, because there's a lot ado about this game.  Check the positive comments that offer proper reviews on what the game is made of.  Monster Hunter titles are exceptional fun.  I wrote a few paragraphs in this review before being interrupted by the character limit here.To sum things up, Monster Hunter games are about bringing low very big and powerful monsters.  To help with this, you have a very wide and fun arsenal of weapons and hunter tools to go about this job.  You must track monsters, find these monsters, then target their weak points while addressing shortcomings of your own, such as elemental resistances, to take them out.  There is a wide variety of them to hunt and it is difficult to get bored in this game.If you've played other Monster Hunter titles in the past, this game is more streamlined than its predecessors.  No more paintballs, no more zoning in to a dozen different spots.  It's all interconnected.  You have scout flies that loosely guide you to your hunt mark.  There is a shorter list of monsters in this title compared to others, but QoL improvements here make the game worth it.If you have any pressing questions, feel free to comment on the review and we can chat.
Silver	Not Recommended	102.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/silverl4d/	MH Veteran.500h MHF2//3000h MHFU//200h MHTri//400h MHP3rd//1000h MH3U//2000h MH4U//100h MHX(generations)Pros:+It's a Monster Hunter game. On PC.+Great animations and visuals in general. +Weapons seem to be well balanced in comparison to prior titles.+Less tedium. Especially when gathering.+No loading times between map areas (about time)+Highly customizable loadouts, item belt settings, etc.+Good tutorials. Nice for beginners.+Combat is tons of fun. Albeit a bit crazy sometimes.Cons:-Menu navigation, Just awful. Much more awful than in previous titles. I am especially triggered by the book animation that is played when browsing quests EVERY SINGLE TIME. (I know about the speed up)-Lack of graphical options. Motion blur and DoF need to be optional.- No option to disable the annoying af scout flies. I am not blind nor stupid. I can find gathering spots without it. Please don't clutter my screen.-Hilariously bad optimization. Srsly, considering the looks of the game, it runs like garbage. Get 2+ ppl with elemental weapons and watch any NASA PC spew out 30 fps on average during combat. No matter the settings. It's unforgiveable for a multiplayer game.-Speaking of which, reduce the special effects and particles in combat situations. Spares my eyes and boosts fps. ez win/win.-Everything about the multiplayer. Getting a group on a PSP using x-link kai was more straightforward. This is a ~cOnNecTeD eXpErIenCe~ I never imagined to feel this lonely in. It's impossible to get a pub group going. Everyone just  SOS flares and then disbands because it's the only half decent way to get multiplayer. I really miss setting up a room and taking turns with ppl picking quests.-Chat system. Why is it so hard to access? Why are NPC dialogues, progress notifications and other junk displayed in the same screen area? Let me press "y" and ♥♥♥♥ing chat. I don't want to navigate through 3 menues to say something. -Can't see hunters in headquarters. And nobody is in the gathering hall. Ever.-Network errors are far too common.-Where are the 200k ppl playing? I never see more than ~20 lobbies (with mostly 1-2 player in each) REGARDLESS OF THE FILTER SETTINGS. WHERE ARE THE PEOPLE?????-Unskippable cutscences. Spare me those. I know how to play MH.-Too easy, aka where is my ♥♥♥♥ing G-Rank?. I roll everything solo with the iron tree weapons and don't even care about the skills.-Sound system. Maybe it's me, but after trying several ingame settings, everything sounds muddy and indistinctive in my DT770's.Conclusion:There is so much more I'd like to add but chances are, nobody reads it ayways. So a few last sentences:I am pretty disillusioned. What they did for 6 months porting the game is inexplicable to me. It can't be (performance) optimization for PC, that's for sure. The antiquated UI and menus are impractical and tedious to navigate. You need strong willpower to explore the many options given. Abandon all hope at CAPCOM fixing anything. That would be foolish to assume given their track record. For diehard MH fans a must buy. For everyone else, not so much. The game gets bad reviews for a reason.----------------------------Edit-----------------------------I hope you guys can understand what It takes to leave a negative review for this game. As someone who waited for the pc version for literally 10 years. Because from the very beginning I was convinced that playing on 400 x 240 pixels screen with 30 fps doesn't do this gorgeous game justice. And when it finally happened, even though I love the franchise to death, I cannot turn a blind eye to the many issues it has.Sure some of them are nitpicked. But it adds up. And they do add up fast.
Starl	Not Recommended	116.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984919186/	This PC port has massive issues (almost Dark Souls 1 level) and i cannot recommend buying one.   First of all - controls are messed up. If you were going to buy this game and play on mouse+keyboard, i cannot recommend you to do so. let me explain why:  The game in its essense emulates a gamepad. In case of mouse it emulates right stick. The word 'emulate' is not an exaggeration. Your mouse has acceleration always on and has capped max speed. You cannot turn fast no matter how fast you move your mouse, you cannot target something precisely because inertia in emulated stick movement. it feels HORRIBLE.  The game has lock-on system and you switch targets with a mouse. Oookay, but do as much as lightly touch it and your screen goes all over the place, switching all the targets possible 3+ times each. Apparently developers never heard of 'dead zone'.   Radial menus. You think one would press Q, mouse over something and use it. Wrong! You have to use WASD to navigate radial menus, which is ... bad. At the very least it's practically impossible to drink a potion while moving. You can use F1-F4 and then 1-9 instead, but it's not very convenient (mostly due to pressing F1-F4 buttons beforehand, try pressing F1 then 7 very fast).   And now we get to keybindings, which are implemented horribly. Once again, emulation. If 2 actions are on same button on gamepad, they're on same button on keyboard. You cannot detach them like in other modern games. For example, on gamepad Special Attack and Interact are both on B, if i want to move Special Attack to side mouse button for example, i cannot bind interact to E separately, it moves to side mouse button as well.   Now that we're done with controls, let me also mention low graphics quality for 2018 in form of multiple low resolution textures (on max setting, mind you)  and mid 2000-s lighting. It's just not on par with other modern games.   Another weak point is multiplayer which is derived from old mobile (PSP, 3DS) ad-hoc parties. You have to join open session with up to 16 players, none of them you can see anywhere in the world, and then may form parties with them for specific quest. This design feels wrong and outdated.   Also, you cannot play co-op with your friend, because game does not allow you to join your friend on story mission you did not complete solo (or with somebody elses help) first.  All in all, the game is decent, combat is fresh and interesting, monster design (gameplay wise) is good, but overall quality of this port detracts from the experience big time. That kind of quality has no place in this day and age. I would recommend to buy it on a 50% sale at least, it's not worth full price.
AnimeDude #IZ*ONE	Recommended	112.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zerker15/	despite all the problems, all i just wanna do is hunt down monsters solo or with friends. As long as the game does what a Monster Hunter game does, any small problems i encounter doesn't make me feel like i wasted my money.
Ysfr	Recommended	193.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ysfrplays/	Been playing Monster Hunter World for a few days now and it's time for an initial review.Out of all the MH games I played, this is by far the easiest, though it's still challenging in it's own right. You can run while using items, (cept for traps ofc) which is a HUGE help considering that a big♥♥♥♥♥monster is always after you. Crafting is a breeze since you can automatically have things crafted as you gather mats. Gathering is also easier since you can just spam the gather button while passing by resources (although there are special nodes that could be mined a lot that requires you to stop).The servers aren't stable yet, but once it is, this would be a pretty fun game for enthusiasts and newbies alike. Just a friendly reminder, though, this game isn't easy. Don't expect it to hold your hand and the monsters could one shot you if you don't know how to dodge/block. To quote a comment I read today, this game isn't for people who think they are Rambo. I mean, unless you're a light bowgun user lmao.If you want a challenging game and you don't have the phrase "I quit." in your vocabulary, hop right in! This is fun!
0xc355	Recommended	115.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025177769/	I normally don't review games, but seeing monster hunter world with "mixed" on steam feels awful. There are technical problems with online play on launch, and capcom could have maybe handled it better, but it shouldn't detract from what's essentially an amazing game. If you're a fan of tight combat and a immersive environment, this is a must-try title. I've bought this game on PS4 and again on PC, and I'd definitely say it's worth the money.

The single player game is good, fun even, but the lack of any proper online connectivity, something the series has always had, is pathetic.They took 7 months to finalize the PC port? What in the actual hell were they doing? We have found serious game breaking problems inside one week. This was not tested at all, just fobbed off on the paying customer. And the list of things Capcom tries to tell people to do is the same list you would give to your QA team, but they don't have one, instead we get it, the customer.If I pitched you the idea of half-assing a product, spending more than the budget on advertisements, and making the customer pay for the job of being a QA tester, you would laugh me out of the room.Yet, that is exactly what this company has done.People want the game they were promised, the game they paid for, and all we get is silence from Capcom."Oh, we're aware of an issue causing people to disconnect from groups and are looking into it"That does no one any good who can't even connect in the first place, Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Error 50382-MW1Capcom said, "Open these ports xxxxx-xxxxx"We did, still Error 50382-MW1People have said to add -nofriendsui -udp, or -nofriendsui -tcp to the Steam launch options.We did, still Error 50382-MW1The online ran so smoothly the first 2 days, exactly 2 days then it all became Error 50382-MW1It's really foolish of Capcom that now they have to try and fix what they should have been fixing for the past seven months. And who gets punished? Capcom? Nope, they get to count their money.It is the paying customer who is now punished for Capcom's absolute laziness.They wanted to push the console versions out the door so they could focus on the PC port?The console versions look, and run like crap. A sign that they didn't even know what they were doing on the consoles.Then they said they wanted to take 7 months to make sure they get the PC version right.I am just stunned by how little effort was made by Capcom, but all the while they charge full price, not a reduced price to reflect their reduced effort.MHW PC has incredible potential, but if Capcom continues ignoring the reports, the only one they'll have to blame for this mess is themselves.
Djarn Dry Longtowel	Not Recommended	175.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Djangdrai_LongTowel/	Almost 60 hours on the clock, this is one of the best games I have played to date. While I understand that people have had issues with network and the controls, I've had no real issues playing with a controller.HOWEVER, THE GAME CAN CRASH/FREEZE AFTER DEFEATING THE FINAL BOSS, WHICH CORRUPTS YOUR SAVE FILE PERMANENTLY. This issue has been brought to light online, yet I did not know it before heading into the quest. Now my 60 hours of progress has gone down the drain. It has been an incredible journey getting to the end game, but this issue alone ruined the whole experience. There needs to be a fix immediately, as I am sure that it affects more than just a few people. Besides, losing all your progress at THE FINAL BOSS has to be the worst thing that can happen to a person. Please fix.

Maybe. We might change our opinion and kick you out in the middle of the quest though. Oh ? You have a perfectly good OC'd CPU ? Yeah, no. I won't let you launch it. It's a 3 years old CPU, you better upgrade. Why ? Well those good folks at Denuvo gave us amazing BJ's so we'll go with them instead of doing what our customers want. If you don't like it, don't play it. Whoops I forgot, you can't play it anyway.We might fix the servers sometime, maybe next month. But Denuvo is here to stay, f¨k you and your opinion. We paid like 300.000€ from our server budget to Denuvo, it'll surely drop the piracy and generate us even more income !Oh and we heard someone asking for PC related options like motion blur and depth of field. Honestly, adding 3 lines of codes is just too much work. we might do it later. Next month maybe.MHW Group 
Mysfyt	Recommended	309.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mysfyt/	Hello, World! Having played this on both PS4 and now PC (and having put hundreds of hours into the portable games), I have been very pleased with the quality of this console port... with a few footnotes. The first few weeks were chock full of connection errors that made it difficult-to-impossible to play with others. Capcom pretty quickly acknowledged the problem, and it took a little time for them to fix it, but fix it they did. Although this game is completely soloable, playing with friends is hands-down some of the most fun gaming I've ever had. I realize that, as with any big PC release, there have been a wide range of experiences with actual performance. For me (with my newish CPU and oldish video card), it runs wonderfully, never straying from a rock-solid 60fps. The only change I made was to drop fog down a notch or two, which (subjectively) looks a lot better anyway unless you like a LOT of fog.This is a game designed around controller play, and I'm finding my experience with a Steam Controller to be excellent. Gyro toggle on left trigger soft pull makes kinsect/bow/bowgun aiming SO nice and fluid. Mouse-like joystick for the right touchpad feels very smooth and natural. Keyboard controls, on the other hand, are... well, they're bad. The mouse emulation feels so "wrong" that I cannot play it more than a few minutes without getting severley nauseated. I hope for KB/M loyalists that Capcom improves this soon.As for the game itself... well, if you've played any Monster Hunter games, you (mostly) know what you're getting into. World doesn't have the breadth of content of the portable games (yet), but I feel its quality-of-life upgrades, and the whole "World" bit (living zones full of endemic life and environmental tools/hazards), more than make up for this. If you have never played a MH game, I'm not sure how to explain it with any brevity because this franchise is really quite unlike anything else out there except for that new kid on the block, Dauntless, which definitely takes queues from MH but feels so shallow in comparison. My gripes are relatively minor and mostly aimed at the questionable design decisions Capcom sometimes makes. The Gathering Hub is a nice place to prep with your group, but since it doesn't have access to all facilities, I hardly ever go there. Session IDs feel like a kludgey way to handle private groups. Steam Group integration is completely pointless right now.I personally feel like Capcom did an amazing job making a modernized, full-sized version of this long-running, mostly portable franchise. It's far from being just an upscaled copy of the earlier games, too. They obviously put a lot of thought and effort into making a game with potential for mass appeal that still feels very true to the franchise. It WILL NOT be for everybody, though. Monster hunter games are very challenging and take some dedication, but when things start to click, it's a uniquely satisfying gaming experience, especially when you can play with friends.

MidnightCoffee	Recommended	109.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaybeNorthKoreaIsntSoBad/	There's not much to say here, it's a monster hunter game.  Easily the best in the franchise for new players to get into.Gameplay is smooth, there are hitbox issues with certain monsters but it's a minor annoying detail more than it is a game-breaking rule.  There are performance issues for some PCs, but I cannot speak for this myself as I've had no issues.  The endgame RNG farming is annoying, but aslong truthfully the gameplay itself is enjoyable enough that I don't see myself minding too badly.  COOP and online issues are perfectly fine now, they've completely fixed it.  I've had no issues with it since patch.

My major gripe is I can't play story mode with my friends. Why. This has never been a problem in past games. There are good alternative but you chose the poopiest which is to block friends joining in story missions unless they've seen all cutscenes. And in doing so forcing people to jump hoops and do janky workarounds just to play with each other. Where's the fun in that. Does it even matter that theres 16-man room at this point? SOS flares sounds good on paper but people joining might as well be one-off NPCs at that rate. Just mindblowing why multiplayer is handled this way. Disappointing.
𝕮𝖔𝖕𝖎𝖆	Recommended	316.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lettherebeghost/	Monster Hunter has completely destroyed my social life, 10/10 would play it again.
✩☠✩KING✩☠✩	Recommended	90.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AlxEllis/	Monster Hunter on PC AT LAST!First off my specs: GTX 1070, i7 6700K and 16GB of ram (For reference)So how is it? well it's pretty good actually! but it's not perfect, no sir!. For starters, the fps in this game can TANK from a stable 80 to 20 or under in some scenes (certain monster attacks that spray particles or extreme bright light are when this normally happens) also TURN THAT FANCY LIGHTING OFF, it will grant you around 15-20 frames more ensuring you stay in the 60s most of the time. The only reason I make an issue out of this is while the graphics are good, they aren't good enough to warrant the frame drops (as I mentioned in my 7 Days to Die review)Now, moving on to disconnections, for me personally I rarely got disconnected, but when I did it was FRUSTRATING as all hell, the simple reason is, if you are in a team of 4 people hunting a monster and you get disconnected, you are left ALONE to hunt the monster, BUT you are fighting a monster that has had the difficulty scaled to 4 players...by yourself, for the same rewards, which can be a serious pain. My controller ALSO did not work when I first tried this game, but restarting my PC fixed it.Other than those gripes? it's a DAMN good game, If you've played a MH game before you'll be familiar with how things work, pick one of the many weapons, practice with it, choose which one suits you, kill monsters, upgrade weapon, repeat. However MH: World has some quality of life changes mainly being able to "track" monsters, saving you from running around the map like an idiot searching for them like in the earlier games, this makes hunts alot less tedious and allows you to get the job done with far less faffing around.The crafting system in MH: World seems daunting at first but it's really simple and there are SO many things to craft so GRAB EVERYTHING YOU SEE!. There are many guides online to help you get started in this game which can seriously help give you a less rocky start, so get googling/youtubing guys!Overall I LOVED Monster Hunter: World, ESPECIALLY the music, it is simply amazing! I like the Tzitsi Ya Ku and Arena battle music the most. The online is also awesome, providing you don't get stuck with a team of imbeciles it's pretty enjoyable as a team game, and multiplayer is a big part of this game, plus you get your own individual LOOT so no fighting over materials. Another thing I liked was I kept thinking I would grow tired and bored of the constant repetitive quests, gathering etc but I didn't, I still loved every minute of it hour after hour, this game is VERY addicting.Technical issues aside, I definitely recommend Monster Hunter: World, but I also advise you do some research into it, this game is NOT for everyone and the 2 hour limit for refunds really isn't enough to get to the meat of this game, so be ABSOLUTELY sure you're gonna like it before dropping £50 on it!. However, if you DO end up liking it? KISS YOUR SOCIAL LIFE GOODBYE, the only social life you'll have from now on is joining multiplayer hunting sessions.But seriously...social life is overrated...Monster Hunter: World however...IS NOT!

CMDR Shven	Not Recommended	97.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103487651/	It's a cool game and I'm gonna play it a lot but I'm giving it a thumbs down (would give it a middle finger up) purely because of the moronic decision to restrict co op based on who has seen what cutscenes. Way to go guys. Borderlands came out 9 years ago and they had seemless live, continuous multiplayer for the entire game, yet you can't figure out how to get two people to play the same story mission unless one of them has already (essentially) beaten it. Just what friends want to do: Take turns waiting until the other player has completed a mission so they can replay it together, but only one of them for the first time.
Jcyrus	Not Recommended	22.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jcyrus/	Cannot recommend this game yet as the keyboard/mouse controls are awful. There is some kind of mouse smoothing, acceleration, or emulation going on that creates a sluggish cursor, and you cannot turn it off in the options.If you're going to play right now you are going to have to do it with a controller, because otherwise it will feel terrible merely running around or interacting with the UI.Capcom either needs to turn off whatever they've done to the mouse, or add a warning onto the store page that a controller is recommended.
Physh	Not Recommended	94.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bigphysh/	If you're a Monster Hunter fan, you're not reading reviews and you probably own the game already. This review isn't for you. For everyone else, especially PC-exclusive gamers, I have to tentatively give this a thumbs down for two reasons. The first is what can only be described as an assinine multiplayer system that is so convoluted I can't being to understand what they were thinking: storyline missions can't be attempted together as a group without first watching all the cutscenes in a mission, abandoning the mission, and then rejoining a group. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out multiplayer. The second is that raw mouse input isn't supported, meaning a controller is HIGHLY recommended. It's 2018 and Capcom can't figure out raw mouse input.I love the monster hunter series and will continue playing this as a solo game until the high rank missions, where I'm assured it gets better, but until these issues are fixed I can't recommend the game in good faith.

Brojisan	Recommended	33.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141560704/	If you're interested in trying this game, be aware that your 2 hour trial period will not be a reasonable assessment of this game. The entire first hour is entirely cutscenes with a little bit of walking between them, I'm not exaggerating. It's been 40 minutes since I started the game up so far, and the controls I have used are:(1) Movement(2) Dash(3) Press B to pick up a footprint. This is an actually aggregious waste of the player's time.
Deltablood	Recommended	251.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deltablood_/	Didn't expect the game to run so smoothly on PC. Mouse and Keyboard controls are surprisingly comfortable too. Fantastic game.
Blue	Recommended	184.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/for4phor/	I decided to wait a week or so before writing this review - it is easy to get triggered over port/launch growing pains, especially over a title as huge as Monster Hunter.Quick and Dirty - huge thumbs up. It's an extremely fun game for folks new to the series that eases you in to the life before trying to murder you.Details: The game staggered out the door with pretty debilitating connectivity issues that prevented people from playing together.  Most of the reviews were made during this time, so I feel, at a glance, they don't represent the game well.  Capcom has patched since, and tho there are still a few connectivity issues, I haven't had any now in almost 20 hours of gameplay since the fix went live.If you've never played Monster Hunter before (like me), the idea is very simple.  You hunt monsters and use their loot to  make better armor and weapons so that you can go out  and hunter meaner monsters for better loot and armor.  It's a simple template, but ohhhhh so satisfying.There is a plethora of armor, weapons, augments, and skill gems, which are very diverse - huge 2 handed swords, daggers, sword n board, huge slow firing guns, agile guns, the bow of course, and the unique weapons like the insect glaive.  My point is that this game can cater to almost any playstyle.The fights themselves are intense. You can spend 10-30 minutes just on one hunt and not breathe for at least half of that time.  Each new monster seems challenging, tho going back to them once you've been at it a while  just makes you shake your head at the thought that these cute little things were ever scary.Single Player is definitely a thing.  The monsters aren't quite as aggressive and are dialed back a bit. You can bring your trusty Palico with you  - a cat pretty much, that can buff/help you in a few ways.  It's a nice way to play if you have to be offline or if you just enjoy the solo challenge.  It's definitely more forgiving than previous Monster Hunters when it comes to solo play.Multi-Player is where it's at for me.  You can have up to 4 players on a hunt.  If you have just 2 players, your Palico's can join you.  There is just something really great about throwing down against these huge monsters with 3 other people that is so satisfying.The game still has some performance quirks to work out, especially for folks wanting to get the most out of their PCs.  I am not one to crucify a game because it isn't a virtual reality masterpiece.  It is a beautiful game on my 970 and runs at 60fps.. and that is enough for me.That's pretty much it.  If you read this far, thank you, and I really hope you enjoy Monster Hunter: World if you decide to give it a shot - I know I did!
[CPC] Froh	Recommended	98.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/frohlemageblanc/	So... my second time in the Monster Hunter universe, first time was trying the psp version so doesn't really count.This is a grindy game, so if you don't like grind, do not get it.Interesting coop "hunting" world based on the fun hunting part itself (no survival stuff to do other than surviving monsters)Pros :- Huge world- Lots of small details that make the game really alive- Lots of stuff to do / to grind for- The gameplay part is fluid, spot on, interesting and with a lot of depth- Hunting Horn- A lot of interesting weapons, each with their own mechanicsCons :- Denuvo- Horrendous UI at times (even with autocraft)- Multiplayer is made hard to play for no reason : story mode can't be played coop due to cutscenes, so you have to quit multiplayer on each new quest and join together back after the cutscene, despite life of monsters being scaled, the money reward is divided, etc...- DLC at launch :/- Latest updates from consoles not included for some reason- Unoptimized- PC controls are crap (but you can get used to)- Not "that" beginner friendlyYou'll note that there's a lot of drawbacks listed, but the game is so good to play that it still end on a positive note. This is a game you explore, a game you discover, and a game that you want to play again and again. Also a game on each you could rage a lot. But that's part of the experience.
Aubog007	Recommended	247.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aubog007/	Fix the connection issues and it's golden.Vets complaining about the difficulty. Hello, if you are actually a vet, then you'd know standard MH release practices. If not, please don't complain. Don't go shoving hours into my face expecting me to be impressed. If you know the franchise, then you'd understand this is a VERY good game, and a great rebirth of the series, with plenty more to come now, since the smashing success of world.Also, I understand the frustration with PC issues, from my understanding, some of that falls on Nvidia as well, and that's extremely unfortunate. I hate the knee jerk reaction of the general public to be negative about anything, without expressing positives. I sincerely hope everyone interested give this a fair try instead of being massively frustrated by the walls of negative reviews. Thank you for reading, and hunt on!
iX	Recommended	518.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iX1805/	Enjoyable game, with a large amount of content to sink your teeth into, an easy recommendation for people who enjoy a cooperative experience. Issues listed below have been resolved Currently there's a fair amount of bugs which are affecting a variety of people, with the biggest / major problem being connectivity. People who purchased the game are rightly frustrated that they're unable to play with their friends.Port forwarding the monster hunter ports seems to have helped with connectivity issues for me personally and haven't suffered connection drops while playing with friends.If you're planning on playing the game solo the majority of the time, your probably fine purchasing the game in its current state. Otherwise, I'd keep an eye out for patches and purchase the game once the connectivity issues have been resolved.

Raiden777	Recommended	37.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Raiden777/	There're some small server issues, which I can assume is due to them not being prepared for the massive influx on PC, but other than that, it's a really good port. Other than server, I'm not noticing any issues. Capcom nailed the port.
Beeb?	Recommended	171.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tacanova/	This is the only MH release for PC that means anything and is certainly worth the buy if you know that you like this sort of boss grinding style of game. Shame the devs didn't realize that
[TW]Ken	Recommended	140.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/0fanfusuzi0/	A little hard to get use to, but it's always fun to fight big monsters.Hug variety of monsters, so you never get bored.Other than fighting, the maps is hug, and not have so much loading screen.Great Grapic. fishing is fun too=PThe only down side is the game can be bit challange sometimes, but after you get familiar with the weapon you choose, it's great. and the mutiplayer still have some problems, seriously hope they will repair it soon. getting disconnect is terrible in mid fight. but still fun playing with other players
[SWE]Dr Brobotnik	Recommended	206.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025473150/	Okay, this game is what everybody who likes Monster Hunter wants, it has all the things that made the previous installments great, varied and meaingful combat, cool monsters, cool gear, and a slew of weapons, some new and some returning ones that have been given new tricks to shine with. With that out of the way, this is a port of the original PS4 version and the port, while working well enough for most players, have been suffering some issues with a large enough number of players to range in four digit number. I'm not talking about minor problems that doesn't stop you from having a good time, but rather CTD's, incomplete optimizations, FPS loss and not being able to start the game. An unofficial patch is out by now and it can be found in the Steam news.For more info on what the problems are, check the forums. Capcom have not patched it themselves yet but the game launched one day before the weekend so it's not that strange.The online funconality is also not working constantly server side, but this will most likely be fixed. I'm gonna recommend this game on the basis that is will probably work and is a terrific game, but the port has problems and if this turns you off then you may want to hold off for now and let them fix things.
Giraffeguin	Recommended	233.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062206693/	What is Monster Hunter? Local area man wanders into an island with his bi-pedal cat pal and smacks down monsters to wear them and use their skin and bones to defeat even bigger tougher monsters. And so the cycle continues until eventually monsters that used to take you 30 minutes to kill now take a mere 5 minutes. It's a journey of growth and self improvement and there is no greater satisfaction than when everything clicks and you're able to conquer old foes. It's pretty much a game of nonstop boss fights with some farming and gathering on the side (note there are literal farms you can utilize to reduce the gathering needed) as well as a dress up sim with your cat and character which you use the parts of the monsters you've hunted to craft youself new gear.I love this game so much that I previously owned it on PS4 and decided to buy it again for PC to play with friends and experience better load times, etc. At launch there were definitely issues with connection but I have not experienced disconnects in a long while now. Maybe it is different for other players.Load times are nearly non-existant. I have already surpassed my PS4 save (I stopped before Devil Jho came out in anticipation of replaying on PC) with less hours played! It's amazing. The world is so beautiful and this is truly Monster Hunter at its prime. I went to play Generations Ultimate for the classic MH expereince again (I played MH3U and MH4U in the past) after World and the quality of life (QoL) differences were astounding. I missed World immediately. Faster gathering, infinite whetstone and gathering tools, one giant field map instead of zones with loading screens, etc.  I'd say the only real downgrades are less monsters and not being able to play as your Palico - boo! The new monsters are pretty awesome but I do miss the likes of Zinogre, Brachydios, Tigrex and more.Oh, also being forced to play the story again is kind of annoying. Cutscenes really should be skippable in 2018, come on Capcom. The way online is handled for story mode is also rather stupid. If you want to play with a friend you have to each start the mission separately, watch the cutscene, then one leaves and joins the other. However this was a design decision on the Ps4 version as well, equally dumb then. Once you complete the story its not really an issue anymore and MH Vets like to say the story is the tutorial and the real game starts after. Not wrong, really!After the story is completed the world is your oyster really in how you choose to spend your time. Grind for those decorations and augment stones to spoof up your builds and imrpove your kill times, help out others in any ranks, take on tempered monsters,  raise your rank, play with friends, take on the arenas and challenges, and my personal favorite -- experiment with new weapons and builds with all the excess materials gathered!Most people associate PC with hackers; I have only seen one hacker so far and he was harmless - a HR198 yet clearly had not yet beaten the story (only had one tool) and he just hung around the session. The hacker problem isn't really as rampant as one might think and a majority of people want to play the game legit.Overall, if you never played a Monster Hunter game before but have been interested this is the best one to get into thanks to all the QoL changes introduced. And if you played already on console or classic titles I'd still recommend this if have a friend group to play with or would like to meet a new community of hunters.10 outta 10 Palicoes recommend the game.
Billy Herrington	Recommended	327.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/33venom33/	So here is a real honest review, after 207 hours of gameplay. First id like to say for those who dont want to read an essay, this game got an undeserved bad rep. I mean sure the game has issues but they arent ones that justify it being given a 45% total score. So let me just address the issues really quick, or at least the ones I know of that have impacted me. In the first week of release the multiplayer of this game was horrific, I mean seriously. You would queue up a quest with your friends, get about 5 minutes in and then be disconnected. The way the game works it also meant that even if your friends did disconnect, although the match wouldnt end and you would all be against the monster in your own solo missions, the monster would retain its multiplayer difficulty level and still does to this day. This means that when the multiplayer crashes, for the most part the mission is unplayable. Other issues I encountered was just how much CPU this game eats up. Like seriously, what is it doing? Its running at 97% CPU and sometimes during the handler cooking cutscene it makes my pc grind down to the point where it seems like its dying. These however are my only issues with the game, and the multiplayer has dramatically improved, however still not amazing its at least playable 90% of the time and im sure with consistent fixes it will become 100%. The CPU issue, im no computer scientist but im sure they can patch the game or do something to optimise it so it doesnt eat such an ungodly amount of CPU. Now to the positives, and they really are positive. This game is beyond refreshing to me, this game has and will continue to provide me with hours of amazing entertainment. The satisfaction levels on this game are the highest ive ever felt playing a game, whether its beating a boss by the skin of your teeth in the early game, to grinding and farming rare item drops to try and take on the tougher end game tempered bosses, the progression of this game is superb, you overcome mountains each day and consistently improve. The weapon choice is amazing, you can play the hard hitting mass damage greatsword with a slow and devastating play style, or you can go rapid damage dual blades, even using my personal favourite the insect glaive where you can do all sorts of acrobatics around the monster applying debuffs or explosive clouds. The combat truely is wonderful, there are so many different weapons and thanks to the jewels and skills there are so many ways to play these weapons which means you can play a bit of everything and mix things up so you never feel bored. In terms of monsters, yes i would like a greater variation many monsters are very similar and there are far too many damn flying monsters for my liking and yes I would love some more balancing as although there are so many armour sets, in the end game stage really only a handfull are actually viable, id love for them to be a bit more balanced and be able to run these obscure pieces without getting smashed because theyre so low defense. I think they really need to release the DLC asap to bring it to the same level as the console version as Im incredibly jealous of the console gamers having behemoth and kulve but the game hasnt been out long so i can only hope it does come out and soon enough. I think the reason this game got so badly recieved is because people just took it at face value, we had to wait 8 months for what is essentially a vanilla port that on release had a host of issues so people just took straight to steam to leave bad reviews, if people actually took a step back and played the game as it improved and gave it a chance then they would see that actually this game is incredible and without a doubt my favourite release in the last 5 years at least.
Agent Smith	Recommended	103.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Red071River/	Explore a beautiful new world, study the magnificent creatures that live there, and cut them down for a new hat for your cat. Welcome to Monter Hunter World.Honestly I love this game, I did play the PS4 version, but figured, why not pick up the PC one as well? The game is exactly the same of course, with a few differences that are good and bad. I quickly plugged in my controller because I was just used to that, but go with whatever style suits you. With fourteen different weapon types to choose from and a ton of armor and ability options, it's hard to say not to go with what suits a person personally. Enjoy the hunts, and don't worry if you can't take down a more difficult monster. A few failed missions, and you will learn a lot more than taking one down in a sinlge go. Have fun, don't stagger your friends, and good luck hunters. Pros: Hunt dinosaurs. Okay, they aren't dinosaurs.  Beautiful music, but there's no better feeling that hunting a TobiKodachi to Thunderstruck. Scenery that takes your breath away. Just don't stare too long, or you'll get carted. Always evolving challenges that you can tackle at your own personal pace. 60 FPS. Nuff said. Hunt with friends.Cons: Right now it seems multiplayer is having connectivity issues. This may change over time.  Mouse & Keyboard vs. Controller decision. Not constantly the same smoothness. Check out Teostra's lair fight. Lower end CPUs are suffering from the resource hogging the game does.  Hunt with friends.TLDR: An amazing game with a thriving community, active devs, and beautiful scenery/gameplay.

Caudecius	Not Recommended	131.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047684634/	Capcom's highest sale game finally comes for PC, after 6 months of "improvements". Whoa, you may think, the port sounds awesome! If you consider the horrendours optmization and textures, the fps dips for no reason at all, even in, medium-high end machines and obligatory blur, with no option to turn it off, you'll begin to see the hell this port is.The optimization and horrendous settings that can't be modified aren't the worse things, the pinnacle of hell resides in the WORST online experience you'll ever have.You begin a mission, get your friends, while hunting monsters: (CONNECTION ERROR: 666 F U K U). All your friends are kicked, you can't call them back, you're alone to fight a harder monster. And it would be ok if it was a once a time thing, but in 70 hours, it have been ALL THE F'ING TIME IN THIS $60 PIECE OF SHEIT.Worse of all, the game is really really really good, and that doesn't help, as the frustation is only multiplied by all the problems. It's outrageous that it takes more than a week to work around all the conections problems, especially when it's the MOSD CAPCOM GAME OF ALL THE F'ING TIME. It's stupid, ridiculous and disgusting what's happening right now. However, you should try this game by all means when they work around the issues, at this rate, in about a month.Really, ♥♥♥♥ crapcom

lexilogo	Recommended	241.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034740265/	So, word of warning: There are currently some connection issues going around re. this game. Contrary to what a select few are reporting, I'm actually able to play it (and that seems to be what the majority are experiencing) but averaging about every hour/hour and a half, the game gets an error and kicks you out. (EDIT: Since the patch, this issue appears to have completely disappeared. There may still be crashes but I can only presume they're very rare)Before people flip their♥♥♥♥♥♥ the issue actually appears to be related to Steam's newest reworks to their friends system and ecetera, so you can blame Valve for trying to fix what wasn't broken, and breaking things in the process.Anyway, the game's excellent. I'm not a series veteran but I had played Monster Hunter prior to this one, and this is certainly an excellent entry into the series. Expect:-Slow but satisfying combat. While the series can be compared to something like Dark Souls' systems, don't expect to be mega-mobile 24/7, with the ability to turn on a dime and run as fast as a speeding bullet. This game's combat is, relatively to even Dark Souls II (the slowest of all the Soulsborne games), even more methodical. While some weapons like the Bow or Insect Glaive let you be pretty mobile for those who prefer that kind of style, the game will demand that if you want to do serious damage, you'll have to commit to a position and stay there. The same, however, goes for the monsters you fight, so it's not exactly unfair.-This game to be more welcoming than pretty much any other MH entry. Now, don't make assumptions: This game is complicated as all hell (what with over a decade of new iterations adding more and more features), and there WILL be mechanics that will confuse you and you'll likely resort to guides on the Internet to fully understand, but this was explicitly made to introduce Monster Hunter to people who had never played it before, and it's also certainly not a dumbed down version of previous MH games. If you can handle the complexity of, say, an MMO, you can absolutely handle Monster Hunter.-A single gameplay loop (hunting giant monsters) that the game will repeat, a lot. If you're playing Monster Hunter for the campaign, don't. This game is made for people who enjoy that formula of planning, tracking, and execution that the series has refined to a knife's edge, and most importantly, it's made for people who are interested in repeating that formula into the post-game. If you just beat games and you're done with them, MH might not be for you, I'd recommend something more singleplayer-driven. (though this game can be played singleplayer and you can still enjoy it)-Slightly less "content" than most other Monster Hunters, but that's probably because they strimmed down the more grindy elements. Even then, we're looking at a 30 hour campaign, a post-game that'll bump the playtime to at least 70 for anyone interested, and a core game that can entertain people for 200+ hours if the core gameplay really hooks them. If you think 30 hours for JUST the main story, in a series heavily centered around post-campaign content, AND in a game that already reduxed the core gameplay of the series into the modern era in a way that feels more smooth and polished than it's ever been, is "not enough", I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to tell you.Overall, a very fun entry into the series that will hopefully serve as a good introduction to those who are new.
Lapinyan	Not Recommended	432.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002558707/	I have 1000+ hours on the PS4 (non-pro) version. I cannot recommend this version in its current state. I was going to write about the game as a whole (it's good, but has some stupid issues that Capcom could easily fix), but I think I'll just stick to the PC-port related issues.Quick summary:Not a super terrible port, but has significant issues. The online issue seems to have been mostly fixed, but there are still other outstanding issues such as the low resolution texture and FPS drops. That said, I'm still playing it because I like the 60fps, fast loading, and mods.To be clear, I cannot recommend a game with major issues that should not even exist. I'd be annoyed if people recommended me a game and it didn't work properly. So I'm not going to do that to others. I paid for this game, I want them to fix it. I'm not complaining for fun. When they fix the remaining issues (eg. FPS, textures) then I'll change my recommendation.Major issues (still relevant as of the early October patch):- Low texture resolution bug reportedly still not fixed.- Haven't had sheathing bug for a while but haven't played much either.- Some people were reportedly locked out of the game for a day due to Denuvo. Seems rare.- Patch crash on startup reportedly fixed in mid-September.- Latest Nvidia drivers (2nd or 3rd update since MHW was released) claim to finally fix the bad frame rate, but some people are reporting frame skipping.- They finally fixed the in-game frame drops from effects.- They said multiplayer issues are fixed, but I still cannot see friends' sessions. It's so much easier to simply connect to Squad Session on PS4.- Disconnection issue seems to have largely been fixed. So far, a friend has only once been disconnected from me.- Still eats a ton of CPU all the time (seen lots of complaints about this, so maybe this is regardless of hardware?). Kaldaien's Special K can reduce this by spoofing CPU count, which increases FPS. He goes into further detail about how this game handles CPU very, very badly.- Steam groups seem like a bigger pain than in-game squads (what the console version has), where everyone could easily join squad sessions.- Video recordings with OBS seem to have significant frame skipping issues. Streamlabs OBS seems to work sometimes, but sometimes not. May have gotten worse with the patch, not sure.- Still lacks some graphic options (eg. DOF, bloom) which could further improve performance. There's a mod for this, but doesn't seem to work consistently for everyone, and it messes with the fur shader.- Mouse and keyboard supported. They added more options but I haven't tried them.- Reportedly, all versions of this game have a small chance of corrupting your savedata. So you should backup regularly, if you can. The corruption seems to occur if you suddenly crash while it's saving.- There is also a rare bug where the game just refuses to save. Apparently this happens with all versions of the game. I've personally never had it happen on PS4, though.- Texture resolution doesn't seem very high, even outside of the texture bug. The PC port size is roughly the same as the PS4 version, so I guess it uses the same resolutions as that. From peeking inside the files, it looks like lots of 1024, some 2048, and only a few 4096. I heard the resolution is lower than the Xbox version. Examples of bad textures: character eyebrow texture in character creation, desert sand texture, ground rock/sandy textures. They all look like scattered blurry blobs, even from a distance. Although, I guess you wouldn't really notice in the heat of combat, unless you're really looking at it.PC port positives:- Loads multiple times faster than the Playstation 4 version, even without an SSD. Not kidding, it is crazy fast. PS4 can take a minute or two. This loads in a few seconds.- Looks nice, when it runs properly. But I've heard many graphic options are not working properly (eg. low texture resolution). - Aside from the above issues, doesn't feel too different from the Playstation 4 version. Very minor improvements to the GUI (take all drops, ability to copy paste session ID).- Steam Workshop mod support. Or so I'm told. Edit: Not expecting Capcom to release modding tools, though.- Several graphic options have a "variable" setting that auto-adjusts graphic options in realtime. Edit: Some are noticeable, some not so.- Gamepad support and key config via Steam Big Picture. Edit: I've heard there are some limitations.- Option to configure confirmation and cancel buttons (fixes the Asia vs West button swap problem).- Edit: Modders are already fixing the lack of fashion customization, and other issues.Conclusion:Edit: Now that the online problem has been fixed, I would like to recommend this game, but I think you still need to weigh in the other issues that it has, and also have a clear understanding of what the Monster Hunter games are like. I get the impression many people jump into this game expecting it to be something totally different, and end up disappointed.It's pretty obvious Capcom didn't test the PC version enough. There was no open beta like the console versions, which would explain why the online started out almost always offline, and why there's a bug where the textures appear very low resolution. And yet they saw fit to give early access to streamers and reviewers, who (as far as i'm aware) did not seem to notice any of these significant issues. Next time, get real testers to test your game.As a game, it feels like just barely enough content (edit: as in, by endgame you'll realize it's stretched fairly thin, with heavy reliance on RNG in endgame). There are some things that are done well, and several things where it feels like they dropped the ball, or are seriously trying to troll customers by doing the opposite of what everybody wants (no joke...for example, despite players complaining about this for almost a year, they keep adding exclusive outfits and hairstyles for NPCs, despite NPCS and players sharing the same models).That being said, if you do enjoy the core combat, then you may end up playing this for a long time. I won't go into detail about the gameplay in this review, but I will say that if you just want something to spend 30+ hours on (rough minimum time to complete story) and you don't mind RELATIVELY "clunky" (ie. compared to what people normally expect) high-risk controls where you cannot rely on lock-on, then you may want to give this game a try.If you want to try it first, and maybe refund it, then be careful not to spend too much time on character creation. Just use a preset, get past the unskippable lengthy intro, and jump into training room to try out the weapons. This is a game that relies very heavily on whether you like how the weapons and combat feels. If you don't, you won't enjoy this game.Oh yeah, a few more things: This game is easier in solo. Multiplayer has a high chance of people screwing up, resulting in quest failure. Also, be warned that monsters can chain multiple attacks to kill you off a single hit, without you being able to do much. This happens often when you're learning the game. You're supposed to try not to get hit. Three deaths means restarting the quest. If that sounds frustrating to you, you may want to avoid this game.Edit: Part of the fun is overcoming these challenges. Once you learn the monster patterns and how to use the weapons effectively, it can be a satisfying experience.By the way, I'm not a veteran of the franchise. This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've fully invested into. From what I've seen others say, compared to previous games, this one is a few steps forward (eg. much better audio/visual, easier to obtain crafting materials, weapon improvements), and a few steps back (eg. less monster variation, story/setting too "casual", annoying NPCs, poor fashion support, lack of things to do in endgame, reliance on limited-time events).

Asian Ellie from The Last of Us	Not Recommended	44.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YogurtStorm/	MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD is a huge, beautiful and ambitious game that does so many things right that it is absolutely frustrating that they neglected the stable operation of online networking and also neglected optimization. I expect these issues to be fixed in time, however it is disappointing that they were not able to iron these out in the extended time it took them to release a PC version.- Frequent disonnects, trouble joining other online matches. I have a low-end connection, however this should be supported and handled accordingly- Steam rich presence will spam your entire friends list (even those who haven't bought this game) with messages of you playing every 5-10 minutes. Pretty bad bug as it affects everybody around you, not only those playing.- Heavy load on hardware. Game looks great but is absolutely unforgiving for mid-end rigs or lower. Impossible for me to go anywhere beyond 60fps and I have a decent rig- By default, game will force steam into Big Picture mode (can be disabled in steam settings)Currently, I recommend avoiding the game and waiting for most of these issues to be alleviated. Wait for sale, you'll also save a few bucks.
Yuphoria	Not Recommended	116.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961265308/	I bought Monster Hunter World at launch.  It is a decent game, but it is not worth $60.  Only get it if you're a die hard Monster Hunter fan.  The PC version is a straight up console port, with no consideration for the PC user.  Game is poorly optimized, graphics are pretty disappointing, but the worst aspects are the camera and controls.  There's some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mouse acceleration going on that you can't turn off, the camera locking thing is pretty useless and clunky.  If you are a pc gamer, you'll notice the flaws immediately. Now onto the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ aspects of the game that isn't due to it being a port.Unskippable long cutscenes - There's almost 30 minutes of cutscenes before you get to play at all.Btw, the game doesn't automatically save for you if you begin a quest, so if you crash to desktop during the first quest, have fun rewatching the cutscenes again. Multiplayer - I purchased this game with the intention of playing coop with my friend.  The multiplayer interface is not intuitive at all.   You will never see another player in your town, except at the gathering hub, and even then they have to be in the same session as you.  There's a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥that you have to try out to get multiplayer working.  Worst of all, you can't even do the story quests together without watching the cutscenes that are only available AFTER you've started the quest.  The game doesn't tell you this, and just gives you some msg that states you aren't on the same quest, which is clearly not true.  Oh btw, there are random disconnects happening every 10-15 mins or so too.TLDR: It's an ok game if you just want to play single player or a die hard Monster Hunter fan. 
DarkAssassin011	Not Recommended	90.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/eeiden/	I would like to preface this review by saying I love to play this game. It is a lot of fun to learn how to hunt each monster and farm and craft the materials from each hunt. Playing this game with friends is where it really shines, and unfortunately this is also where this review goes south.At the time of writing this game's multiplayer is mostly an error code simulator. I have successfully hunted in a group, it is possible but nothing is more disappointing then getting disconnected in the middle of a quest. You lose all of your party members and although you stay in the quest the difficulty stays at the multiplayer level, the monsters get a slight health boost ect. so to finish the hunt requires extra effort. This often leads to a l lot of wasted time.Aside from the multiplayer issues this game is fantastic. The controls take some getting used to unless you opt for the controller. I mapped a lot of buttons to my mouse so it feels pretty good for me. I cant in good sense recommend this game until the connection issues get fixed. If you plan to play solo 100% this game is ready for you today and you will love it. If you are like me and want to play with friends, you will be disappointed.

Aggressively Average	Not Recommended	55.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046946942/	The game is fun if like solo play. If you want the game for the multiplayer Its not worth it until they fix the server issue. Its not unplayable with others because there are moments where a disconnect won't happen, but just be prepared to have yourself or other drop connection mid nergi fight at the most inconvient time or every 10 mintues. I'll change my rating as soon as they fix the issue, but for now not recommended.

Aquamatey	Recommended	113.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034369294/	Played for 400+ hours on PS4 before moving to the PC release, with a short break in between to avoid a burnout, but I'm still feeling very addicted to the experience of my first Monster Hunter game, and enjoying playing it both solo and with friends. The PC release had a rocky launch in terms of online stability and some graphics related issues (the issues I experienced were related to poor framerates in specific game environments, and major framerate drops and game stuttering during thunder elemental attack effects, which not everyone was experiencing. I'm playing on an i9-7900X CPU @ 3.30GHz, 32 GB RAM, GeForce GTX 1080 Ti). Online stability has vastly improved for me playing both in random online sessions, and with friends across NA and EU, since the first patch was released a couple weeks after the game's launch. I have faith the remaining issues will be resolved as the franchise's first PC release continues to grow with the huge success of this game across all platforms it's been released on so far.In terms of the game itself, I'll include my experience of the PS4 release of MHW combined with the PC release, because it definitely feels like to me, the hours I'm putting in on PC now are complimenting the 400+ hours I played on PS4. As my first MH game, even hundreds of hours into the game, I'm still finding myself learning new ways to play, whether it's figuring out a new way to use one of the 14 weapon types available, or discovering a new strategy for any of the (currently) 31+ large monsters available as hunting targets. The behavior of the monsters varies enough from hunt to hunt, and across multiple environments, to keep me on my toes when I start getting a little too cocky or comfortable. Many aspects of the game remind me a great deal of Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen, another Capcom game I very much enjoyed.As the PC release of MHW catches up a bit to the content released on consoles up to now, I have plenty of confidence that my enjoyment of this game won't diminish for many hundreds of hours to come. And to me, that's absolutely been worth the purchase across multiple platforms.
powpowitsme	Recommended	113.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/powpowitsme/	PSA: IF YOU PLAN ON PLAYING THE GAME, IT IS HIGHLY RECCOMENDED THAT YOU INSTALL SPECIAL-K'S MOD.

There's a chance the game will crash and corrupt your save.The corruption bug has been confirmed to NOT EXIST.https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunterWorld/comments/998xpi/xeno_save_corruption_bug_does_not_exist_proof/- It is reccomended to use a controller due to shoddy PC controls.- TURN OFF VOLUMETRIC FOG. This setting will melt your FPS.I will update this list as new important fixes are found. Notify me if you find anything.Monster Hunter: WORLD is a game where you go out, hunt monsters, carve their bodies to get materials to make bigger, better weapons and armor to hunt bigger, and stronger monsters.As a bit of context, I have played a /lot/ of Monster Hunter. I have 800 hours in 4 Ultimate, 300 in Generations, and around 100 in WORLD for PS4.Monster Hunter: WORLD is an absolutely AMAZING game. The world itself is breathtaking, it feels lifelike and just.. stunning. The Monsters feel like they're part of an actual ecosystem and act as such, with small and big monsters apart co-existing, or in certain monsters cases.. Not existing.The game runs a bit.. shoddily on the PC port, though that's mostly due to hardware not being up to snuff.You WILL need a PC that is relatively powerful to run the game at anywhere near 60 FPS. Keep that in mind if you plan on buying the game.There's a bit of a lack of graphical settings, aswell. Motion blur, depth of field, etc. I personally don't mind, having came from the PS4 version with a COMPLETE lack of grapical settings. The game also has some annoying keyboard and mouse controls, but capcom seems to be looking into this.Online stability can be a bit of an annoyance at times. Creating a lobby can just not work sometimes, and connectivity can be screwy. Despite all this..I still reccomend this game. Monster Hunter is amazingly fun, and if you put in the time to try and fix some of the issues yourself, it can be a MUCH smoother experience. I sincerely hope capcom will get their crap together and try to fix the game, though. It can be very annoying to have to install a mod just to have your online work. Even then, the game will sometimes disconnect everyone in a lobby just because "screw you".Monster Hunter: WORLD is an excellent introduction to the Monster Hunter series, but the PC port needs some work. Even then, the game is insanely fun after a bit of elbow grease.

UNARMED!- (LAUNCH ONLY) Connection Issues which REALLY get frustrating if you were to play with friends.- It kind of gets tedious when you always have to button mash your way through a conversation with 3 lines or more to talk to interact/talk to someone like a Smithy, Quest Giver, etc.- It would be better to have the main Hub as where you could see players instead of being forced to the Gathering Hub to see others.- Doing story missions in Co-op/Multiplayer could really be a hassle sometimes honestly.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Final Verdict: 9.5/10~Note: Honestly this could easily be a GOTY for anyone who enjoys this type of genre, but aswell that but honestly not everyone is gonna like this game and not everyone will.WARNING LAUNCH DAY ONLY, DO NOT BE SUPRISED FOR THE AMOUNT OF CONNECTION ISSUES IF YOU WERE TO PURCHASE THIS GAME AT IT'S CURRENT STATE, THIS WILL GET PATCHED SOON AND CAPCOM AND VALVE ARE WORKING ON IT.

Admiral RedPanda	Not Recommended	117.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/red_panda/	This game is great I can assure you that, got almost 200 hours on PS4 and that aint even much compared to other people HOWEVER the pc port is crap and that ruins it. The PC port would be passable if only it didn't take them 8 months to release a port and "get it right" and on top of that you cant get an online session going for more than an hour to save your life.As a bonus the PC release currently doesnt include any of the updates added to the console versions, I can understand their reasoning behind this (and their excuses) but just keep that in mind if you absolutely really want this because of the latest monster they added to the PS4 version or something, because it's not on PC yet (hopefully).I would love to but I cannot recommend a full price purchase of this game at this point in time, check back after (and if) they fix it. It was worth the full price I paid on console, but so far wasn't worth the full price I paid on PC.

The only issue with the game at the moment is the connection issue, which is not game breaking at all and should not give the game mixed reviews. It will be fixed you may sometimes get kicked from player session or not be able to connect the first time but all you have to do is create a fresh session, which you shouldnt have to but its not the hardest thing to do and then connect...

Alizarin Crimson	Recommended	78.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CKTofu/	Monster Hunter: World is a great Monster Hunter game, with some issues that are rightfully criticized, and some that are overblown.Pros: - Monster Hunting is great, the gameplay is great. Combat is very methodical and punishing if you aren't learning the monster- Performs acceptably. From my experience playing on PS4, getting a around 60-70 FPS at max settings 2560x1440 on a 1080Ti. Turned down the volumetric fog from Highest to High to gain another 10 ish FPS without significant impact on the graphics- Great load times vs my time playing on PS4, SSD or no. The PS4 load times were a constant (minor) source of frustrationNeutral:- Maybe not as optimized as possible, but personally I think the performance is adequate- Pretty CPU-intensive. I have an i7-6700K @ 4.4GHz and I'll get about 60-70% load on max settings. Manages to use more than 4 CPU threads, unlike many games. All 8 threads of my 6700K get involved- Mouse acceleration kills me on the inside, but I think it's partly balance. Being able to aim as swiftly as a normal mouse could be game-breaking Oh, the sweet lord Raw Input has arrived, looking forward to giving m+k a go now that raw input is available.- The best UX in any Monster Hunter game (not saying much since the UX is still pretty painful at times)Cons:- Missing some graphical options I wish were there (Primarily disabling depth-of-field and motion blur)- Networking issues are currently a moderately significant issue. Seems to be a bigger problem with matchmaking than with custom lobbies with friends, but issues still occur there. (they are looking into it, and hopefully resolve this). - A Patch has been put out for the networking issues. I personally haven't had any disconnects since the patch, and I haven't heard of any issues from friends who play the game, so everything seems far more stable, and any networking bugs that remain appear to be fairly minor.- Disconnecting during a multiplayer match just leaves you in your hunt, but suddenly solo. No re-loading or anything, your monster is at the same %HP it was before your disconnect, but you're suddenly not in a group and fighting the multiplayer-HP version of the boss with your Palibro. You don't get kicked out of the hunt or anything, but it definitely sucks that the monster doesn't drop back down to the same %HP but with the Solo HP maximum. Generally not a big deal, but it sucks to restart your hunt if you D/C off the bat. Hopefully a minor inconvenience now with the new networking patch.Would I recommend this game? Yeah, I would. Monster Hunting is a good time, and I think anyone who thinks they might like Monster Hunter will enjoy this game. Hopefully the networking issues are resolved quickly, since they're definitely the biggest problem.
NettleSoup	Recommended	30.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nettle_Soup/	Best MH game so far. That said, ridiculously expensive, a real CPU hog and has a lot of disconnection issues multiplayer. If you're not already into MH, wait and see where it settles, maybe wait for a sale. If you are, it's worth it. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, it's (hopefully) launch week jank.
LAXY	Recommended	88.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/captainlaxy/	I'm going to try and be as unbiased as possible for this.Yeah, you know what, the game launched a pile of trash. Weird errors, certain processors not supported and online was busted. For 2 weeks, the biggest feature of the game didn't work for a lot of people, and that's terrible. Hell, it still doesn't work for some people. Now, I never had an issue with that, but a lot of my friends did, and it killed their interest.Now that issue is (at least mostly) fixed, and they are consistently working on fixes, it's clear they want this to be a good port. The multiplayer is hard for people to understand, there's a dumb stipulation where you can't join a story quest until the host as well as anyone wanting to join the quest has watched the cutscene on their own time, and you know what, compared to other Monster Hunter games, there's just not enough monsters. ALSO WHY DO ALL BUT THE ENDGAME WEAPONS LACK UNIQUE DESIGNS, WHERE'S MY GUNHAMMER.ALL THIS BEING SAID, ♥♥♥♥ is this game fun. I mean really fun.There's no better feeling than just getting together with friends, goofing around, hunting some big♥♥♥♥♥monsters. The flow in this game is great, and the animations, the scale of the monsters, they all add to the experience.Flashpodding a Rathalos only for you and your other Hammer-wielding friend to beat on him with Big Bang combos while singing "Hi-ho, hi-ho, it's off to work we go" is awesome. Teaching newcomers to the series the ropes and hearing them freak out when they first see a Teostra supernova is one of the biggest joys in life, at least for me.So yeah, it's a bit buggy, and a CPU hog, but those can be fixed. The gameplay, which is something that should have been solid from the start, is damn solid. That's what makes this all worth it.
Hentai Hero	Recommended	112.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136986106/	I remember being a young kid and grabbing monster hunter for ps2 from EB Games. I was so bad at it but something about it made me love it. I have played every monster hunter since then and I must say this game is amazing. I understand that there are some things some veteran players may dislike but as for me I think it's the most accessible and fun Monster Hunter to date. I hope they continue this "open world" theme in future titles.

Nescow	Recommended	60.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198181521885/	I didn't play this on console so I have nothing to compare it to. I have an i7-2600k that isn't overclocked, mostly because of my motherboard. I started off my mh journey in mh4 where I clocked in around 700~ hours. Then when mhgen came out I played it for around 300~, and I also played mh3 on the wii u for a little bit. This series really grew on me, and when I found out it was coming to pc, I was ecstatic. So far it is the best monster game that I have ever played, but not perfect. Some things I want changed is a optional tutorial, skipable cut scenes, and for the game to become more gpu friendly. Having to put all the stress on the cpu makes for a lot of problems for me. When I'm playing a game I might pull up a video just to kill time, which is pretty hard to do when my cpu is always close to 100%. None of these problems made my experience (so far) less enjoyable. I hope people can stop negative reviewing this game on the reason of not taking the time to learn the 14 unique weapons and mechanics. I love this series and if your new, take some time to see where this series came from and be grateful that CAPCOM did something as wonderful as this.
medli20	Recommended	118.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/medli20/	TL;DR at bottom.The PC port of Monster Hunter: World has been something I've been looking forward to for a long, long time. Having been a fan of both 4 Ultimate and Generations, I have a bit of experience playing the core games, which set up my expectations for MH:World. Things I was expecting: * fighting monsters* Palicoes of varying levels of helpfulness* loooooots of micro-managing* agonizing over which combinations of armor pieces would create the best set* Trying to figure out how the hell to upgrade my weapon to get what I want* That feeling of despair when the monster flees your area and you forgot to mark it with a paintball* A maybe-not-quite-immersive-but-still-fun and reliable multiplayer experienceHaving said that, this game has taken my expectations and thrown them in a blender, for better or worse. I've seen some comments/reviews from other people complaining about the amount of foraging and micro-managing there is in the series. This is a series staple-- it's to be expected. Embraced, even. There's still monsters to fight, and they are challenging. Palicoes in this game are not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, but they are invaluable supports that can dig you out of a tight spot. The actual hunting feels AMAZING. While there aren't as MANY locales to explore as there were in past games, they're incredibly dense, immersive, and are full of all sorts of things to explore. Even when you're looking for a monster, finding a shiny gathering point or a new endemic creature to add to your collection of pets is a joy. Best of all is the tracking. In past games, if you forgot to bring paintballs to mark the monster, you were SOL if the Rathalos you were just fighting flew off to another area. In MH:World, tracking has been made easier and more immersive. You really feel like you're stalking a dinosaur through a jungle, rather than just checking your minimap for a big pink dot. Actually fighting the monster you've been hunting is also a delight. Damage counters are a delightful new addition and really help you keep track of what parts are more vulnerable than others. I've really only tried using the Hunting Horn in this game, but even just that feels weighty and satisfying to whack things with.This game has taken the idea of armor skills and weapon upgrades and simplified the process significantly. Gone are the days of lamenting over the fact that you couldn't get enough points in Evade Dist to actually get a useful skill. ANY points in ANY skill will leave an impact. Being able to visualize the weapon upgrade trees is a godsend.Overall, the game is fun as hell....if you're playing singleplayer. Multiplayer is an absolute trainwreck.What's that? You used a voucher to double your hunt rewards, and you took off to fight this Kirin with your friend? That's all fine and all, but lol sucks for you, we've scaled up the difficulty for multiplayer and now your friend can't connect to your lobby because of server issues, so now you've wasted a valuable resource and you've died three times, gg"Oh, but that's no problem for me, since I'm just gonna do LAN multiplayer with my roommate so I don't need to rely on Capcom's servers," you might say. WELL CAPCOM DON'T GIVE A♥♥♥♥♥♥ABOUT THAT, since your only option is online multiplayer. Seriously. You could be 5 feet away from the person you're playing with, and your session will still be ripped to shreds within three minutes of starting a mission because of some jive♥♥♥♥♥servers held together by toothpicks and chewing gum.And this happens. Every. Single. Time.EDIT 22 AUGUST 2018: This bug is apparently on Steam's end, not Capcom's. Regardless of whose fault it is, if multiplayer is important to you, this will severely hamper your enjoyment of the game. disregard that, this has been fixed. I'd still like to see LAN support though.There's a solution floating around on the interweb about disabling Steam's new friends overlay to improve performance, but even that does little to improve anything. It's gotten to the point where my boyfriend (the most hardcore MH fan that I know, started playing around Freedom Unite) and I are just completely turned off from playing what SHOULD be the most ambitious, immersive, beautiful game in this series that we are both enamored with.And to top it off: You might just lose your entire save file because of a glitch that happens around the end of the game. I haven't experienced it yet myself, but it's well-documented, and now I'm paranoid as hell, digging around my steam files and making backups of♥♥♥♥♥♥I shouldn't actually have to back up with regular, unmodded gameplay.EDIT 22 AUGUST 2018: Apparently this is a misconception. There is a bug that will crash your game during the last cutscene, and attempts at loading back into your game will put you back into the same cutscene that your machine will be unable to play, depending on your operating system. A current hotfix is to update your media codecs. More information can be found here. This, however, does not change my opinion on the jankiness of the game, since it is a massive bug with such an obscure fix that we should not be dealing with in 2018. The time of Commodore 64s has passed. At the very least, this information should be on the system requirements.TL;DROverall: 10/10 gameplay, when things go wellMASSIVE, COLOSSAL game-breaking bugs that make the game feel like pulling teeth.As such, I cannot FULLY recommend the game in its current state. If all you want to do is singleplayer, and you're careful about backing up your save file, then definitely give it a go. If multiplayer is your jimmy-jam, then stay well away from this game until there's a fix.Edit 25 August 2018: Game's been fixed. After playing for a good few hours on the newest patch (as of writing this review), I have no further issues with this game. A+ game, would highly recommend. Stayed up way too late playing with Boyfriend and now we're both extremely sleepy and satisfied with our purchase. Apparently, changing the rating to "recommended" also clears out steam user ratings so I want it to be on record that this review had a rating of 348 "helpful" and 43 "funny." I'm a very delicate person and I need every bit of validation from strangers to make life easier for me. Waaaah. Great game tho, definitely worth the loss of internet points. (end edit)Also I found The Handler to be obnoxious. Bring back Guildmarm.
SO3A	Recommended	54.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SO3A/	This game rocks. I don't really care for leaving a normal review on this game, so I'm just going to say that this game is stupid fun, all the weapons are cool in some way, and despite having to do the same thing over and over, it still never feels repetitive. It doesn't have some dumb story like God Eater either, so that's a plus. The only downside I can think of is the unskippable  cutscenes, but that's about it. Buy this game.
dOxxx	Recommended	168.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012272175/	I haven't played any of the previous Monster Hunter games, so that may affect how you interpret my review.Monster Hunter: World is a beautiful game with fantastic monsters, environments that feel alive and an approachable difficulty ramp. The monsters are challenging but learnable, requiring you to adjust your equipment and tactics. Equipment requires a small amount of "grinding" to get the materials. You'll probably have enough to make one or two pieces after a fight.I played co-op with a partner through most of the "low rank" game. There were some minor problems at the start with disconnects, but nothing major.The UI is pretty good for what is essentially a console game ported to PC. There are some weird key and mouse button assignments but you can customize it if you like. I just stuck with the defaults until muscle memory kicked in.
Яцѕѕіаи Бот	Recommended	124.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059953519/	Good game
Killian	Recommended	84.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/intenze260/	10/10- This game will need an ultimate version like previous games with G-ranks.- More previous monsters (zinogre, gore magala...).- Please let armor/weapon designers do crazy design like previous games, a bit disapointing in MHW.and then it will be a 20/10 
Equinox	Recommended	114.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Exaltprime/	my first Monster hunter was Monster Hunter 2 for the PS2 then MHFU for PSP and then MHP3rdi sunk 814 hours on my MHFU save and 1131 hours on my MHP3d. (i still have my save)with that said...I love Monster Hunter World! I hope capcom expands MHWorld with new areas, previous monsters and more Elder Dragons. I can't believe that after 10 years, i'm playing monster hunter again. The only bad thing that i could say for MHworld is that Denuvo is a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ And please capcom, optimize the game properly, don't skirt on us PC players.Would i recommend this game? Yes and NoYes, if you want something new to try on. Keep in mind, Changing weapons in this game will change your playstyle! There are no "Best" weapons just different playstyles. Never box yourself with the idea that you can only main 1 or 2 weapons. this game is your hunting sandbox. Kill or Capture, do whatever you like. an example is when i hit Hunter Rank 7 i was getting kinda bored with my Longsword so i changed my weapon to Switchaxe (because i refuse to touch my favourite Greatsword without the best equipment) and that refreshed my love again for the game.I don't recommend this for people who are going to try and approach this as another "souls" game. No, it's not. This is monster hunter. This is not a hack n slash game. You're going to have to adapt to situations and circumstances as the fight goes on. Monster Hunter World is as Monster Hunter as it can be.
Goritude	Recommended	275.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sMk4800/	Monster Hunter World is the masterpiece of the MH series. Gorgeous graphics, epic battles and unique depth make it a must-play.

Raven	Recommended	50.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116707027/	The dung you see on the floor is mine
Fluffington	Recommended	282.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112290828/	Monster Hunter world is a Great game which focuses on fighting and huntig of Big monsters in a livley world which is separated into a few big (at the monent  5 ) habitates in which said monsters live. after hunting a monster you can make new gear and wepons (which there are 14 diffrent weapon types, out of which you can choose the one that fits your playstyle best) out of the materials you recive from killing or capturing it to fight more powerful monsters easier.im saying easier because you dont need the best gear. in this game your progress isn't just in the number of your gear but more so in your progression as the player: understanding of the game, its combat, your weapon and the monsters you fight.it may same hard at first but it is fair and fun to learn. dont be descouraged by failiure. "its okay to cart."to new Hunter:If you never played a monster hunter and this sounds good to you give the game a shot! i can only recomend you do.don't be descuraged the game isn't easy to get into altough easier tha previous titles to do so. you learn from failure. definetley a great experience. most of the negative ratings where about connection issues which are mostly fixed as of now. the game is a lot of fun alone or with friends but you should try both to see what you prefer.To older Hunters or people that wanna read more:Monster Hunter has never looked so pretty, the monsters and the world never acted this close to actual living animals and actual working ecosystems and the hitboxes and controls never feld as responsive and fair before. BUT with better hitboxes and controls the game also gets "easier". thats a "problem" in a lot of veterans eyes. i actually like the new feel and i dont think that a game should get more difficult trough technical inaccuracy but rather trough challenging movesets fast moves or interessting mechanics which we have less of because There is no G-rank in this game as of now(exiting mechanics from resent mh games such as the frenzy virus or ferus monsters arent in the game either) . it stops at high rank. Besides that there are far less monsters in this game than in most other titles. still a lot of beasts to fight but not as many as in other games altough they are planing to add more areas, mosnters and gear that comes with it over time. The new monsters range from generic to interestingly designed but they are all woth taking a look atand there are some old monsters that got a new coat of paint gameplay wise. every fight is fun. (except lavafish but we dont talk about him here.) there are a lot of quality of live upgrades to help you jump to the acction faster in the begining and not go back to gathering later on. The skill system has changed quite a bit but i dont want to touch on that here and there are a good amount oif guides out there. long story short Charms are now random while you have to get your decos via random drop of a certain kind of new quest variant. the good skill decos have tramendusly low droprates and it can be a pain to get them. not if your lucky ofcourse. but this actually helps the game stay alive because with the lack of a lot of mosnters there is also less quest and gear to farm (as of the time of me writing this) than you may remember from other games. it deffinatly has less content but in my opinion that mostly because the cut out most of the annoying gathering quets. they are still there but a lot less tha before. the game also puts a good bit of focus when it comes to exploring the new areas since they are way more interactive than ever before. mosnters live and hunt like animal you are no longer ther center of attention.
Naalikettu	Recommended	337.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050328261/	Capcom needs to put effort into communicating with the playerbase. Plain and simple. Many people feel abandoned and partly cash grabbed. Content is just running out, making the game boring after a while. Farming gems for the same monsters you got them from is not fun at all.Due to the success of the PC sales I expect a lot for the future. Addition of the G-rank, ice map and bug type monsters would be epic.The later stages of the game get boring. Just too easy and too few monsters. The G-rank would be a huge help.It just feels that there is no point to fight the non-Elder Dragons. The normal big monsters need something.The raw mouse input should have been at the start... No going around it. Fix way too late.The game could be near perfect by fixing a couple of annoying features. (MHW has it easy to be honest unlike some other games that have had to do stupid amounts of work) That is why I think it is arrogant to say that fixes require too much work or *not worth*.Statements like that devalue customers who have actually bought the game by not seeing them worth working for.Some key points:-The hit boxes are awful at times, usually mediocre or semi-frustrating. Always room to improve :) (Tail hit boxes while monster charging etc.)-Let people advance through story together. Really mean it..-Some minor UI tweaks (i.e. Decoration reroll ritual sell button should not be green and big. Needs 'take all' button)-Use keybindings separately and not in a form of action groups as in (carve/special attack/talk) opens a possibility of utilising keyboard better-Let KB use the quick menu instantly by pressing a hot key (quick-crafting, emotes, items, etc) "F1 to instantly craft item x"A decent game but it could be SO MUCH MORE. The periodic radio silence from Capcom is absolutely terrible.
Jahandar	Recommended	145.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jahandar/	Great game! The fights have the intensity of a Dark Souls boss, adding a lot of gameplay depth from the various weapons and other mechanics. The monster hunting and crafting gameplay loop is satisfying and co-op has been a lot of fun.
Truz	Recommended	281.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/antarcticflavor/	No more flexing? Harvesting while running?What do you mean wyverns have new telegraphing?!Provided Denuvo doesn't sabotage your performance, this is one of the best MonHuns to date.As always, it's a game of risk calculations and hitbox alignments for glamorous phat damage. While newbies may clumsily flail or patiently wait like in Dark Souls, with time and mastery they may find it entirely possible to be in the fray and on the offensive at all times; charging through attacks with their own attacks, gracefully stringing infinite combos and never letting up the pressure. This holds true now more than before, so much that veterans may be slightly disoriented at first, as this is the fastest, flashiest and most fluid MonHun has ever been. But after 100 hours and counting, I feel confident in saying I agree with the direction CAPCOM has chosen.That's not to say there aren't tweaks that could be made! The current interaction of monster behavior and pot drinking means health recovery is rarely more than a DPS sacrifice, and the undermining of gathering halls is an awful misstep. We don't even know for sure if we'll get G-rank. And while there's a lot of detail and pro/con I could (but don't care to) describe (because it's a Steam review which will be read by two people), the big point is that MHW is the most excitement I've felt for the series to date.
Super Salty	Recommended	59.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051391855/	Great game, I used to play Monster Hunter 3 back when it came out for wii. And this game brings out the same fun as that one.
Papettie xD	Recommended	71.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141177415/	Probably one of my favorite games from this year. One of the first games that I have loved to grind to get better gear. Good by yourself. Amazing with friends. Look up guides to things that you don't understand and don't be afraid to try anohter weapon!
Nithralder	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nithralder/	The PC version of Monster Hunter: World was delayed by 8 months to make the game the best possible version it can be! with that being said, this is clearly not the best version it can be. There was no pre-load ability, no 21:9 support, no SLI/Crossfire support, bad optimization, cannot disable motion blur, mouse acceleration or depth of field, playing with a friend is a nightmare due to co-op restrictions and the keyboard and mouse controls are horrible, voice acting is limited, and the graphics are equal to that of console. Another problem is with the Denuvo DRM program that is giving some PC's major problems even launching the game. Denuvo is also making it difficult for the modding community who're trying to fix this broken mess of a game.
Purrmaid	Recommended	194.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Purrmaid/	With all the negative reviews I'm going to add my two cents.The multiplayer can give you a headache if you don't know how it works, but once you figure it out it isn't that bad. Takes a few seconds upon hosting the game. and when you choose a mission, they have to also choose the mission and TADAA!All story missions with cinematic scenes are solo, which scared the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of me. But the moment a boss appeared I could choose between:1. Send up an SOS flare and get random help2. Go back to town and rehost the quest, at this point it is no longer a solo mission and you can do it with your friends.A lot of peopl are complaining about disconnects from the multiplayer lobby, it's only happened to me twice in my 25 hours so either I'm lucky or these guys are spoiled. I've seen people complain about the game feeling sluggish - that's monster hunter, try a different weapon. I personally think it's a great port, it switches from keyboard to controller with ease. I didn't like SOME of the buttons on keyboard but they're all changeable.

Syche	Not Recommended	186.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003386543/	Fun game but way too many issues to be able to recommend it at the moment. Can't speak for the console version but the PC port seems to need a major overhaul.Your hardware does not matter. There are 2-3 bosses will destroy your fps (I'm looking at you fire lion) when they attack and using lightning weapons will lag anyone on the map.  My gtx 1080 weeps.Connection is absolutely horrific, I even disconnect from my own sessions when solo. I'd say at LEAST half the quests I join with randoms the session will close out and youll be stuck solo. When playing with friends we have to close out the game and restart sessions constantly to avoid dc's and just make it so we can see each others sessions. If these issues actually get fixed I'd change my review. Hopefully the fixes will come before Megaman Legends 3.

Create a party and press play, NOPE.1 player literally plays solo until cutscene while rest of your 2-3 player party jerk off in the town hoping there would be new things to craft? Then with an SOS signal you call your buddies for help? I mean if monsters grow stronger as other players join, its just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you cant play the whole quest and watch the cutscene together.

A literally game breaking one. So you see, if something goes wrong during a saving, your save file gets corrupted and the program is unable to load it. NOw that is rather common knowledge, right? FUN FACT: During the last boss you have a fairly high chance of your save file actually getting corrupted. And awesome as this game is, IT DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY BACKUP YOUR SAVE FILES. So as i unknowingly started the game back up i was greeted with "unable to load save". This was way before i even got to the title screen so i was like "yea, whatever probably just my keybinds n stuff" and hit restore default save. WELL ♥♥♥♥ ME, AS IT TURNED OUT, IT WAS NOT JUST THE ♥♥♥♥ING SETTINGS SAVE, but the little ♥♥♥♥ just literally wiped MY ENTIRE GAME SAVE. 117 HOURS of playtime LOST in the void. Down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it went. And what do i hear when i try to call their support phoneline? ... The number...does not exist.  "hurr durr we want to ensure a good pc release" aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand the technical side of things is an utter failure
RemineTheCat	Not Recommended	66.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NekoNation/	16/8/2018: Not Recommended.- This game runs ~60FPS on a 1060 6GB, 16GB RAM, i7-7700HQ, with all low...this sucks- Network is bad. For me, I constantly have to check my network in every online  game, so I know that this could (potentially) be smooth while playing MH:W. Instead, the game rarely connects me to any open session, dumps me into offline while I want to have some fun helping strangers to beat Anjanath, or in the middle of the fight with Rathian... Not that I mind, but the entire network system could have been better.
Memori	Not Recommended	91.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/momo_memori/	This is a beautiful game with amazing animations and astonishing immersive UI. The audio is okay too, though not the best I've experienced. I'm having tons of fun playing with friends for as far the game grants me. What I mean by that is that the game doesn't come without fun-ruining issues:There are constant disconnects and it affects your steam's online status too. That may raise an eyebrow, but it's true. some of those disconnects will also instance you from your lobby, where you are left alone fighting against the monster. This is truely upsetting, and REALLY needs to be fixed.It is impossible to fully enjoy playing with your friends while progressing through the story. You constantly have to go into the mission, watch/do the intro/cutscene, and back out again just so you can start the mission with your friends.Poorly optimized in a way that there's a noticable delay between moving the mouse and seeing movement on screen, even on downscaled graphics on 1080p with a GTX1080, for people with a monitor refresh rate higher than 100Hz (it barely reaches 110FPS). No v-sync and unlocked FPS ofcourse.Mouse input gets altered to emulate controller joysticks. This means there's an ease-in and ease-out whenever you move the mouse, and an upper limit to how fast the mouse can move. This should be changed. PC gamers will not settle for anything less than raw input. This WILL mess with your muscle-memory and have a negative impact on your aim in first person shooters.Slingshot ammo being prioritized over dropped monster materials means you can often spend way too much time trying to collect the materials. Fix this for a much better UX.Monster materials and broken parts disappear after a while. If you're not quick enough, you can miss out on the loot. This is really bad. Parts and materials should stay until the end of time. This is very important to relief players of the pressure of having to pick up or harvest.And then some less urgent issues (above would need to be fixed to turn this review positive):Breaking parts doesn't have a statisfying audiovisual feedback to it. There's only a notification on the chat area. Monster Hunter's World competitor Dauntless does this much better.Attacking always happens in the direction the character is facing and cannot be configured to attack in the direction of the camera. You cannot even steer a bit during the combo while I feel like you should. You often find yourself hitting nothing but air with the monster "behind" you (but in front of the camera). You may call it difficulty, but it is artificial, non-intuitive and the margins on the input are way too long.Insect Glaive cannot recall insect while not idle. Allowing to do this while using an attack, while mid-air, or while stunned would save a lot of headaches of seeing that red-buff turn into white or orange just because you were doing an animation.

megablue	Not Recommended	175.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/megabluemy/	Pros- The world is rich with monsters! - In-depth weapon & combat systems- all the goodness of a monster hunter game but much easier to get into!- Content-rich- really, really engaging gameplay if you are willing to sink time into it and learn and play the game.Cons- not a polished pc game, unable to fully utilize all the advantages of a pc,- low res/poor textures- resolution scaling is buggy/unfinished (no ultrawide support, buggy borderless window mode on ultrawide monitors)- mouse camera control is finicky- extremely poor multiplayer/network stability, at this point it is pretty much a single player exclusive game.- unpolished multiplayer mechanisms & experience (eg, the host need to finish watching all the cutscenes of a quest before everyone else can join)- the root of all evil - Denuvo DRMMiddle Ground- framerate and graphics are kind of fine if you are willing to lower your settingsRecommendations- if you like grindy games that are rich with contents and depth and willing to compromise on mediocre pc port (in term of technical features) buy it!- if you are a pcmasterrace that never settle for anything but perfect optimizations, no, don't buy this (yet?) it is not really a good pc game.- unfortunately, my slider is slightly geared toward the "PC master race" side, it is like 40% like 60% dislike kind of situation so I am going to leave this as a NOT recommend.

CuteFluffyBunny	Not Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cfb/	I preordered this on Green Man Gaming back in July. I would refund it if I could. The Denuvo DRM means that even third party patches won't be able to fix my video issues for a while.Launched it today eager to play with friends, and although it says it supports 3440x1440 it pillarboxes it with giant black bars at both sides. 3440x1440 fullscreen with the latest driver on a 1080 lags even with these huge black boxes it doesn't need to render. [Edit: See footnote for graphic lag.]Gamepad support is about what you'd expect from five years ago. If you have an Xbox controller you can play as long as you don't want to remap keys. Check the steam forum for issues people have with steam controllers.I couldn't even quit the game during tutorial or hunt because I guess it was designed so that you could hit the playstation button to exit? I had to end task with Task Manager.Wait until it's been patched, I'll update the review when I can play. Games that don't support gamepads or 21:9 should have warning labels on steam just like games that don't work in Windows 10.Edit 1: The default for the 1080 is "highest" graphics settings, which I found to drop below 60 frames during expedition. Reducing the Volumetric Lighting quality to medium fixed that. I didn't have to reduce any other setting from highest.

Maho	Recommended	103.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MahoAi/	I'll start with this - I've been playing monster hunter ever since IO was 8 years old, I am a huge fan of the franchise and I love the game (I played it on the ps4 as well) however, just like many others here, the network session issue is a BIG problem, more often than not I cant finish a quest with my friends without them disconnecting, forcing us to restart. the controls were a bit clunky at first, but in this game controller is your greatest friend.I notice some visual issues as well, albeit nothing big or serious, it can get frustrating (monsters teleporting behind you or riding animation cancels itself/needlessly misses), facial expressions can get a bit creepy, too.but again, I would DEFIINTELY  recommend the game to anyone who's into the series or to the genre itself.I am sure they will fix the network issue soon enough and aside from that I dont see any deal-breaking issue in this game.I love it!

🅱️opepa	Not Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiikowboy/	This is a great game that is sure to suck many hours of free time out of my schedule, but....-The online component is very poorly handled. Joining on quests with your friends feels like trying to navigate through Nintendo's online system. You have to join your friend's lobby session, then, you have to join up in their actual quest. This is if you two are within a certain level of story progress, because you cannot join friends' quests if they are further up ahead than you are. That makes sense.. but you also do not get singleplayer progress, if you two are at the same stage in the story. This means you have to do each of the missions twice, one with each person as a host. The game also does not have a high tolerance for internet outages, and you will be dropped instantly, if there are any problems. This has required me to go to the main menu and re-enter the game. Other games will just lag in the lobby for a brief second or two, but this one can drop you entirely, for very brief issues. The online coop in this game is very fun, if you actually get everything working together.-The game will outright not run at all, if you have certain older GPUs or CPUs that are still capable of playing the game at a satisfactory level. This is not an issue for me, but the fact that this is happening due to the DRM (Denuvo) is completely unacceptable. Paying customers should not be punished due to anti-consumer practices.-Unbearably awful keyboard and mouse controls. I play with a PS4 controller, but I have tried out with KB/M, and you should not do that. The game has negative mouse acceleration that attempts to emulate a joystick deadzone. Why???? The UI feels very consolized, when you use KB/M, but it does offer hotkeys for quick use of items.This is an awesome, gorgeous game with some potentially ruinous issues.
Alatok	Not Recommended	39.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055439720/	Fun game and great graphics. Multiplayer seems to be broken. Constant loss of connection to sessions. Doing quests with friends is bugged. Requiring you to do part of the quest alone then abandon. It's really hard to recommend this game in it's current state.
Axolotl	Not Recommended	100.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Khornefire/	As much as I'm having fun playing this game with friends, much of the play time you see here is is waiting for people to reconnect after a server error booted them out.

Sure but only to have them run away about 3 times before they die and each new spot is a new encounter with them (Not to mention, prepare yourself for multiple big monsters just to interfere with the fight...

MrBlue	Not Recommended	106.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thomas01155/	I don't often leave reviews but I feel that Capcom need to be called out on this game. They have provided a fun solo player game. The multiplayer features are severely broken, I have multiple disconnects each day during fights. This completely ruins the game play experience. I thought they would release a patch a few days after launch. All they have done so far is acknowledge their are issues but failed to provide a resolution. The latest Nvidia drivers perform worse than older versions, unsure what went on their. Does no one at Capcom do any kind of testing?
Another Crusader!	Not Recommended	193.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Substance455/	I've been a hunter for a very long time.550 Hours in 3 Ultimate800 Hours in 4 Ultimate200 Hours in Generations (it was pretty short, no g-rank)I used pretty much every weapon across 3 games, and I slew lots of monsters.So when they announced this PC port, I shed a wyvern tear. A lot of new players were gonna be introduced to this amazing game series. I never felt this happy for a game before. I watched it inch its way into the west and grew, like a child or a Zamtrios.Then the port came out. It's gotta DRM. It runs like melting garbage. Multiplayer sometimes doesn't work, and the final boss has an attack that deletes your save file.I have lost a lot of faith in Capcom. We waited a long time because we were promised an optimized port, but were clearly lied to. Makes me wonder how long it'll take for Capcom to realize that DRMs are just expensive, both for their checkbooks and their player's computers.EDIT: Wanted to update my review, The save corruption glitch has pretty much been proved to not exist, and Capcom has fixed multiplayer somewhat. Almost there, Capcom. Almost there.

white devil	Not Recommended	119.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/supermick12/	Great game, but probably the worst pc port that I have played in a long time. Constant disconnects when playing with friends, bugs causing the game to in some ways look worse than the console versions, and overall bad performance (1080ti plus an 8700k and I still get drops below 20 on one specific boss). I'd suggest waiting for the game to be fixed before buying it.
CavemanJohanson	Not Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067190494/	Terrible performance, stupidly bad multiplayer. Oops Crapcom did it again, he played with my heart.. that stupid game.
Wraithan	Not Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wraithan/	Denuvo is enough to give this game a negative rating, but if you want more of a reason:The controls and menus feel very console port. Some of this is awkward bits like having to click into a menu option to change it like you'd do on a controller. Some of this is blatant (RS) in the middle of a circular selector when you hit the item switch button, as if computers tend to have a right stick of some sort. I'm not 100% on this, but I'm pretty sure they are reading in the mouse input and scaling it when you are moving the cursor around in the menus.Basically I believe they translate your mouse movements into joystick movements, which results in delay and weird accelleration issues when you move your mouse.If one of the worst DRM solutions out there and bad controls aren't problems for you, you should buy this. If you, like me, like your PC games to feel like PC games and to not have pretty crappy DRM in your software, then you should avoid this game.EDIT:Turns out the radial menu has a setting but you can only see it in game, you can't see it from the main menu settings. And the radial menu it leaves you with is pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.

WhoTookMyName	Recommended	75.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027439965/	I have been enjoying this game with my friends as well as solo. I can understand some the frustration that some people are having, however I am not suffereing from any of those frustrations. I have only had some minor connection issues but nothing too frequent. Overall, I found this to be a good port, not the best, but certainly a really good port.
Bobsplosion	Recommended	207.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bobsplosion/	Now that the connection problems have been fixed, this game is absolutely recommended for any Monster Hunter fans, old and new.It ultimately fixes a lot of smaller problems from the older games and makes it much more accessible to a wider audience. You really feel like you're hunting a monster as you follow its tracks through a busy jungle.Hundreds of hours of content in here, although still lighter than previous generations. In the end it's still worth the experience.
Bakapito	Recommended	193.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263320540/	After finishing Dark Souls ,Bloodborn,Nioh,Horizon Zero dawn i have to say that this game is Very good in terms of Content and gameplay.- The game is hard and it has its own unique gameplay based on how expirienced u are with your weapon and Very Focused on the items Use.You can use item for every situation and make your life easier or even to make things possible.- Sole reason of the game is to farm and grind, thing is farm is not like afk easy run like Diablo 3 etc, Its more like killing Dark souls 3 first boss but with the chance to get invated by one , two or sometimes even 3 other monsters + the Enviroment.- You dont have to worry about Game Content as it is enough for start plus there are Events with unique rewards at full time changing every now and then, and the fact that u know expansion patches will release to reach ps4 content.- Playing with Friends is very fun and there are even Arena challenges with ladders u can duo to.-Keybindings for Keyboard are not good but u can change everything.

DoodleBob	Recommended	110.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDoodleBob/	The game is incerdibly good. It had server issues at launch which I was not ok with but it didn't impact my overall enjoyment too much. After the server update haven't had a single issue definitely got my moneys worth and can't wait to play some more!
Helmic	Recommended	442.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Helmic/	It's an absolutely brilliant game, the most fun I've had in a game in years, with even its most complex and fiddly bits seeming to have real purpose in either driving long term satisfiaction in progression or pacing the game to space out the adrenaline-pumping highs with quiet or relaxed moments where you just need to sharpen your weapon, heal up, and then track down that boss monster again to continue the fight.It's also a game that gets some very critical things wrong in terms of usability, with multiplayer in particular showing the game's online heritage as a Nintendo exclusive.  To have a friend join you in a storyline mission that has cutscenes in it, you must first start the mission, progress far enough in that mission until you have seen all the cutscenes (which can take as long as 20 minutes to accomplish as you'll often be told to find something with limited direction before the relevant cutscene plays), and then you ahve to abandon the mission and then recreate the mission again so that your friends can join.  Oh, and all your friends have to have seen the cutscene as well themselves, so they all have to be doing the same thing, no exceptions.  This means that playing with friends in anything other than postgame content almost prohibitively time consuming, and since the main campaign where all these shenanigans occur can easily last you 40-60 hours (I'm 90 hours in at the time of writing this review and I still haven't beaten the main campaign yet) a lot of people simply will never reach a point in the game where they can just play the damn game with friends.And that's assuming your connection keeps up.  For what seems to be a peer-to-peer game, everyone I play with suffers from constant disconnections despite clearly still being connected on Steam and on Discord.  Players who are disconnected are then forced to face a boss that's had its HP boosted quite a bit all by themselves. And if you fail the mission because of that disconnect, any resources you spent trying to boost your rewards like vouchers (you get only one a day and can only hold up to five) or investigations are destroyed.Oh, just to make things worse, those scarce vouchers and uses for your investigations are also used the moment you post a mission, whether or not you start it.  You often have to remake a mission because other players can't join it until its remade, so get used to having to choose between your friendships and your willingness to part with your last voucher.  It's needlessly vindictive and punishing for a game that's overly fond of crashing on many people's systems, there's no good reason that those vouchers couldn't just be spent the moment you get your rewards.But I still recommend the game.  It's not in as bad a state as the original Dark Souls at launch, and it's an utterly brilliant game.  It's hard to know what to gush about first: the sheer variety in playstyles afforded by the fourteen different weapon types that all almost play like unqiue genres of games, the exquistiely paced boss fights that alternate between quiet tracking and gathering and loud and bombastic combat, the loving detail put into everything that makes the forests sway in the wind and interact with your hunts or how a Tobi-Kadachi will leave those marks on the trees you find by using them to scratch itself in a lovingly rendered animation, or the massive variety in weapon and armor assets that all have their own niche uses that give you an excuse to collect them all and theorycraft new hyperspecialized builds meant to play a specific role against a single boss, or how item-only progression fixes a lot of problems with level-based progression in RPG's by removing problems like overlevelling or shoehorning you into a specific playstyle forever...It's so hard not to gush about the brilliance of the game, and that makes it so much more painful that the port doesnt' quite do it justice.  It's not even that bad a port, my game has only crashed once in 90 hours of play as I'm using a CPU with FMA3 support - an AMD FX 8350, a CPU that generally doesn't do very good in games but holds a steady 60 FPS at 1080p with a GTX 1070, I can only assume the game's been multithreaded competently.  There's rebinding options and graphic options and little touches that make it clear real effort was put into the PC release.But the parts where it does fail hurts the most, because Monster Hunter is very much a cooperative game at heart and a game with such brilliant interplay between a team and a monster that could easily combo anyone to death that makes one wrong move just doesn't deserve the disconnects, the crashes, the performance issues on different PC's, the horrible UX problems for playing together, the mean-spirited wasting of vouchers and investigations when it's the game that messed up.I still recommend the game.  I still want people to try it, even if it's only for that two hour refund window, because Capcom has promised to support this game and I think people can still love this game despite its serious flaws.  There's just been so much love put into this game that you can feel, the real appreciation for having all these systems interact to create what can only be called fantasy nature porn.  There's what seems to be dozens of lengthy animations of cats cooking you food in the most flamboyant way possible for what amounts to just a buff, thousands and thousands must have been spent just animating that alone.  There's too much effort here to just dismiss it entirely.If the game works on your machine, if you have friends patient enough to deal with the need to use what are effectively even more annoying Friend Codes in a goddamn Steam game, if you like Dark Souls-like combat systems, if this game seems interesting to you, this is probably a game you'll want to pay full price for.  But if you're unsure, wait a few weeks and see if these issues have been addressed.
Saph	Recommended	375.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chiprw/	Held off on writing a review until I finished the story.First and foremost, there is something you should be aware of before purchasing:-The cutscene after the final story monster can allegedly corrupt your save. Simply back up your save beforehand to avoid losing progress. It's under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata[YOUR STEAM ID HERE]\582010\remoteNow then, onto the port. The game has run beautifully from start to finish on my little old 960 with a mix of medium to high settings. A solid 60fps ensured that every hunt felt incredible, from flow to mechanics to just enjoying the stunning environments as I bashed Azure Rathalos' stupid noggin in.Make sure to check your specs on the store page. If you aren't up to snuff then it's not a great idea to buy the game.As for the game itself, well.Monster Huter World is the most recent addition to the franchise, it boast much higher graphical fidelity, greater quality of life features and most importantly, no zone transitions between areas.I went in blind on day 1 and immediately got hooked, taking out low rank relatively quickly and having a blast while doing so. From Jagras to Magdaros, every fight felt unique and challenging in their own ways. The monsters themselves feel much more responsive than previous games and some are pretty challenging if you haven't done your homework on them.As for gear, the team did a fantastic job of reimagining the movesets for weapons. Adding in new combos and mechanics that make them all feel organic to the combat as a whole. I started with the trusty Insect Glaive which boasts a new aerial dodge, new attack animations for the ground and air combos as well as a new elemental/status/healing bug swarm foe the Kinsect to summon. Once hit, the cloud of bugs will apply whatever damage, element or effect your Kinsect is alligned to and they can make for some great combo extenders and openers.About halfway into High Rank I switched back to my MH3U main, the Greatsword. Oh boy, the new greatsword... They added a shoulder tackle that you can use to cancel out of your charged swing or out of a roll as a quicker way to reach the new finisher that does some pretty big boy damage and feels incredible to land. The addition of aerial combat as introduced by 4 has been expanded upon too, when you jump off a ledge there's a brief window where you can hop in any direction when you begin the aerial swing which can be used to combo even the hardiest monsters into submission. Plus you can now charge your aerial swing which allows for greater damage and a higher chance of mounting the monster.There are a number of new mobility mechanics that make the game flow so much smoother than older iterations, my favourite being the slide. When you sprint or roll on a slope your character will slide down at incredible speeds. You can even use new slide attacks out of it and some can even be charged or have a follow-up move.There's also a grappling hook that makes climbing feel much faster as well as it's utility in the newest addition to your hunter arsenal, the Slinger. This little wrist mounted crossbow type weapon can be used with any weapon type and has a ton of ammo types and the ability to grapple onto special grapple points in order to swing around some areas for quicker movement and a nice evasive/offensive option in fights.The slinger boasts a ton of ammo types, including things like throwing knives and various pods used in previous games. There are a number of other types that can be found in the environments including ones like: -Brightmoss, which glows and sticks to whatever it hits, useful for pointing out monster weak points to inexperienced members or just for lighting up dark areas.-Stone, becuse who doesn't love flinging rocks at monsters? Useful for drawing agro and knocking down certain flora which includes some other ammo types.-Scatternut, does a lot of stagger damage and can be useful for extending your friends' combos as they go to town.-Slinger Thorn, sticks to the target and can be hit to deal additional damage. Useful for monster parts that bounce some weapon types and for breaking parts in general.-Watermoss, deals a small amount of water damage and can be used to wash certain dirty monsters for easier damage. There are many more types all with unique effects and utility, making the Slinger an incredibly useful tool for hunting and exploring. Some more fantastical than others, but they all have their uses.Now for quality of life.The first thing I checked was item sets, these are useful for hunters that like to save time at the item box between hunts. Although for another point, camps also have item boxes now. You can enter your tent to change gear and access the item box mid hunt. To make them even more useful you can now eat at camp, meaning if you forget to get your pre-hunt grub on you don't have to worry about being at a disadvantage any more. Oh, and you can fast travel to your camps from anywhere on the map.Moving on, there's the item wheel. This handy little guy lets you quickly use specific items on the fly without cycling through your entire inventory. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this feature is a massive help to the Sword and Shield as it is the only weapon that lets you use items without sheathing it first. It also let's you use the slinger while it's drawn which is great for setting up combos.I also want to talk about how decorations and charms work now. Instead of the traditional points system, abilities now use levels. Say you have a Fire Res decoration, it'll just give you a level in the Fire Res skill when slotted instead of just 2/5 points needed for the first tier of the skill in previous games. Decorations also come in three sizes and as such, so do decoration slots themselves. Meaning the bigger the decoration, the more levels it will provide in the skill it gives.Charms are more or less the same deal, they give specific abilities just like decorations but now they can be upgraded depending on the type. These additions really streamline the skill system and make for a much easier time going for a build you want to use. Armour also functions in the same way, but now there are set bonuses on some sets. Unlike other games though, most don't require you to wear a full set, but rather just 2-5 pieces of the set. This allows for much more freedom without making it feel like a chore to go for specific setups.The verdict, All in all, I'm really enjoying my time with MHW. Connection issues aside it's a fantastic port of a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Couple that with Capcom releasing existing console events and DLC quests for free at a faster rate and you've got a pretty good deal in my book.I will say though that I do have a couple of minor peeves with the game. The first is that the faces look pretty bad up close and the second is the lack of unique weapon designs. Both very minor things, but they do detract a bit from my personal experience.I can't recommend the game enough to anyone looking for a fun hunting sim/ARPG hybrid. There's plenty to do in the game which makes it a great time sink too. Just make sure you can run it before purchase and all should be well.We even just got a patch to address the connectivity issues that were present at launch within the month of release, that's what I'd call consumer friendly.TL;DROnline can be pretty bad at times currently with disconnections from Steam, but the game itself is incredible and completely playable solo. It's well worth a buy in my book and I'm dying for more content already.If you like to hunt, or play good ARPGs, get it.
Ashnagarr	Not Recommended	116.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970331776/	My mind is blown that someone designed this game and was like "Yup, totally makes sense that you have to left click to talk to people in town but right click to talk to people in the world". Or was like "Man, games nowadays don't have enough confirmation pop-ups ... I should totally make players click three times for a simple thing like moving stuff from the inventory to the chest".The core game is great and fun - but boi will you rage about the UI, the lack of game options and the total lack of sense for multiplayer flows. That's also not something you can just fix ... I am sure they could get rid of the stupid DRM that harms people who pay for the game while doing nothing to prevent piracy, but the UI and multiplayer flow is deeply embedded.
ArcticZenith	Recommended	114.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArcticZenith/	Best game ever made.
chubbs	Recommended	65.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/321chubbs/	This is Monster Hunter, and all the people crying about clunkiness do not realize that the MH series is clunky by design.As for the port, I don't understand why people are crying about this port, as it's fine to me.  Runs fine on my end, and even for people who have semi-potato pc's.  It'll run fine on your average gaming pc.  Multiplayer is d/cing randomly but it really isn't as bad as people are complaining about and will probably be fine after release weekend.  My only real complaint is that there is no 21:9 support, just black bars on the sides if you run this at 3440x1440.
Ham	Recommended	52.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034501847/	It's amazing. Honestly, seriously, amazing. Let all the complainers complain, you know why this game had mixed reviews on the first day? Because all the people who found the gameplay important were out playing the game.It runs smoothly on a https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/MONSTER_HUNTER_WORLD/#decent rig, especially when you fiddle a bit with the options, and it looks and plays dreamy.
Wolf	Not Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tensor2/	Laggy. 1024 maximum texture resolution. Is this 2001? Sound is off by 30+ seconds on cut scenes. Playing coop is painful and difficult; basically single player. Mouse acceleration cannot be disabled and motion blur cannot be disabled, making the game both ugly and unplayable. Don't waste a dollar on this.
Beakeman	Not Recommended	233.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030761898/	When I bought this game I had no problems installing and getting the game to run, however, terrible FPS; during cutscenes the audio would be finished about 30 seconds before the video. The game was unplayable. I tried the suggestions others gave to get the FPS up, and they did make the game a bit better, but nothing big. Overnight they updated the game and after that, I was able to run the game perfectly on med graphics. I played the game for a couple days, and then today when I turned the game on I now have the exact same problems again, regardless of the settings.  Great game, wonderful graphics when it works, multiplayer drops giving you disconnect errors frequently, and it's a CPU hog. If they get the multiplayer and FPS issues figured out I'd be hooked.

Cara Delevingne | CS.MONEY	Not Recommended	27.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximusCrushus/	While I have played many hours of Monster Hunter World, and will continue to play I must say I cannot recommend it. With the already limited amount of Multiplayer this game has to offer the multiplayer that is currently in the game is basically unplayable. Friend and I go into a quest together and 10-20 minutes into the battle one of us gets disconnected from the server. The Game took 6 months longer to release then the console version and yet having implemented no working multiplayer is horrendous. With this being said. If the Multiplayer ends up getting fixed ill change my recommendation to Yes. But for now its a strong No.

RUJoshinMe	Not Recommended	91.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198151299081/	Long time monster hunter here. I started back on Tri in 2010 and have played almost every game in the series since then, excluding generations (waiting for the ultimate switch version which releases later this month). I just got to say, Monster Hunter has never looked or played this smooth. I thought that this might ruin the gameplay I have grown accustomed to over the years, but it really doesn’t. Some of the new mechanics I am still getting used to, but this seems like the logical evolution the series needed. Getting critical hits on monsters and shooting their face off with my heavy bowgun feels exhilarating to say the least. So far, it seems to be a tad on the easy side of things when it comes to monster hunter difficulty, but I am still fairly early on in the game and I am assuming that this will ramp up. I am crossing my fingers that we get some proper g rank up in here. I am honestly, a little sad with the way that multiplayer works. As compared to past games you could just post it and go. Here, you have the whole S.O.S. flares which in theory sounds great. Having a little trouble with that single player quest? Shoot off a flare and allies will come help you! I was excited because they claimed you could do the whole single player in multiplayer! In actuality, there are quests that you can’t join until they reach a certain cutscene. This seems silly and it is frustrating to go and join a quest and have the ui tell you you’ve failed to join and give no explanation as to why.  (Come on Capcom, it’s 2018, why can’t you get multiplayer correct?) As far as the pc port is concerned, I haven’t really had any issues. I have a 1060 and a Ryzen 1600 I get minimum 54 fps rarely and most times it sits stable at 60 fps. I turned off fxaa, ambient collusion, and the volumetric options. The game still looks great. A couple things I wish, would be an option to turn off motion blur, turn off motion blur, and TURN OFF MOTION BLUR! Did I mention TURN OFF MOTION BLUR? I am baffled as to why this option was not included? 99 percent of games allow you to do this from within the advanced option. Why Capcom? I wish Capcom would continue to optimize the game, as many reviews are complaining about terrible performance. I am not having issues, but I understand others are. Also, Capcom, turn off denuvo. Just please. I am not going to beat a dead horse for that aspect of the game. Overall on the pc port side of things, Capcom did an OKAY job, the gameplay however, I feel more than makes up for that. So, I am going to give this game a recommendation, just know that Capcom still has lots of room to grow when it comes to ports.*RE-REVIEW After putting more hours into the game I can really see how terrible optomized this pc port is, that along with the issues for multiplayer (dropping in and out randomly, making me lose connection to chat) I have to say, this port is far from finished. It is so frustrating it makes me not want to even play. Fix your game crapcom!

Yuri69~<3	Not Recommended	89.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yuri69/	MHW is a great game with lots of fun, replay value, and action! You make your character with lots of customizable features and then you fight badass dragons monsters and stuff, so it's really great!THOUGH, I have some gripes with MHW compared to previous MH games which some things seem to have been downgraded...1 - Removal of Chakra armor which is a big jab at fashion hunting sets... 2 - Player always having a belt equipped which can't be taken off even when armorless, I know it's for the scoutflies, but belts ruin the look of many nice torso armors for me.. Hopefully, there will be a mod to fix this!3 - If Capcom ever starts banning people for using mods which do stuff like disable the damn motion blur, add transmog, improve textures! I will keep my review negative for all eternity because it shows that they are Crapcom not Capcom.4 - And finally MHW has "layered armor" which seems to have replaced the great transmog mechanic from MHXX/MHGU. This new crappy mechanic not only is locked to specific armors, but from what it seems they plan to use it to sell DLC for money... I mean I would've been fine with it if they sell their crappy samurai skins and allowed players to transmog armor too, but I doubt Crapcom will do that because they're greedy corporate jews... It was for the 4th gripe I HAD to give a negative review because I absolutely hate when a previous game in the franchise does something right then the next installment in the franchise just forgets like that great thing existed or adds it but completely ruined it!!Like if Capcom didn't have their samurai skins maybe I would've been like "Eh, I gueeesss MHW is pretty different from previous games so they don't want them to be too similar...", but NO with these samurai skins it shows they could've and can do it BUT they won't and probably never will because they want everyone to buy their samurai skins then they can get that sweet DLC mONEYYYYYYyyyyyy!!If Capcom does add transmog in the future just like it was in MHXX/MHGU then I take back all my words, rate it recommend the game 1,000 times and I would even buy all their damn samurai skins and cha-cha dance emotes to support that wonderful selfless decision to appease rabid fashion hunters like me which have to hunt with no armor on and getting stepped on by a great jagras means instant death.PS: Even though my review is negative I wholeheartedly say this game is extremely fun and every hour spent into I did not feel was wasted! I recommend it if you don't play on a potato as the game is a little bit demanding!

DarkFenix	Recommended	227.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkfenix2k5/	The pros:Well, it's Monster Hunter. It's finally come to PC, where it should stay.The cons:Well, it's Capcom. That means an otherwise excellent game marred by sloppy QA, lazy porting, and slow patching.Overall:In spite of the game's technical flaws (for me it crashes a lot when minimising, and is always disconnecting) it's still awesome fun, still worth buying (though not at Steam's exorbitant price, seriously, go to other licensed sellers), and definitely still worth playing.
Michael Westen	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/neal1231/	Great game! It is my first Monster Hunter and it is a great experience! It has a few issues on PC like the random network drops however, I think it's probably from the fact that over 200k people are playing it currently. Some people are complaining of FPS issues and I recommend turning off volume rendering to increase FPS. I'm currently running 1440p @ 100 FPS with drops when the monster has certian effects like ice.Overall, I highly recommend this game.

King_Bums	Recommended	155.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/King_Bums/	I have put in near 100 hours in this game as of writing this. I write this review as i wait for the credits too end for my first playthrough and i must say, this was a beautiful and amazing game to play. The game is an excellent intro to newcomers to the series and a swell game for veterans of the series. I will not use any special formats like pro and cons i will simply put it as it is. This game teaches you what you need too know to play and have fun but leaves some stuff a mystery so that you have to play and understand the weapons and builds that you make. Even with 100 hours i have only use two weapons so there is still much more for me to experience as i get up to hr-100. The only things i did not enjoy were being unable to connect to friends quest or getting randomly disconnected during quest. As this past week and a half have gone by they have beocme less frequesntly i assume from server maintenance but regardless i see no major problems with this game and i recommend anyone to give it a try and play it for a bit. P.S. The "Bug" everyone thought was a bug is just a missing file that you can find online or on the MHW subreddit and even then its rare for people to get it. Regardless enjoy the game if you desire it and try op builds and random stuff you think is awesome thats all.P.S.S. Dodogama is best boy, the ABSOLUTE UNIT

Metis	Not Recommended	119.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/m3tis/	I'd really like to give this game a positive review. The gameplay is great and the weapons and monsters offer much to learn. But the current optimization is just terrible. It's clear from the get-go that this game is a console port. Don't even try to play this with your mouse and keyboard. It's just a clunky mess. Also the game tends to crash when tabbing out. Sometimes my controller doesn't get recognized due to no apparent reason. And as if this isn't enough there are also many issues with connecting to friends sessions.TL:DR: Great game but it needs a ton of fixes

Wildstar	Not Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/29_wildstar/	If you want to play with a specific friend or group of friends, the multiplayer matchmaking aspects of this game are terrible. If you want to play with a bunch of random people, it's merely bad.  I have no idea how the actual multiplayer gameplay is because I could never get the matchmaking to work. And since that is the big hook on this game, that really sucks. Quests have two difficulty levels, 1 player or 4 player. This is set when you pick how many players you possibly want to join you on a quest. Not by how many players are actually participating. So if you want to play with another friends, and you set the quest limit to two players, you had better hope you can get matchmaking to work, and that y'all can play like you are 4 people.  And that is assuming you can get matchmaking to work.All the secret steps you have to take in order to get quests to work with multiplayer remind me of hiccup cures, in that they may or may not work for you. Even if they do, they are very unintuitive, and not documented anywhere in the game. Want to do a story quest with friends? That is like getting four people to simultaneously flush four marine toilets. It's absurdly complicated. And undocumented. Then there are expeditions, which have a different set of absurd conditions and steps. And god help you if there is a cutscene involved, then that is a different set of steps.Finally, you have to go through this garbage process every single time you take a new mission or expedition. If you were expecting a game like any other PC coop multiplayer game (Boderlands, Nazi Zombie Army, Left 4 Dead, The Division, Dying Light, Killing Floor, Dead Island, etc, etc) where you get your group together and go play - prepare yourself to be exceptionally disappointed.I've enjoyed the singleplayer, but it isn't as good as any other dedicated singleplayer game. They story and plot elements are basic and threadbare. Basically a framework to justify going out with a group of folks and murder monsters. And that is what  I got this game for. I got this game to play with friends & family. All it has been in that regard is a huge steaming pile of frustration.

fartbird	Recommended	63.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tankpig/	Overall this is a pretty good game, but the biggest thing to note about it is that it'll take about 3-ish hours before it'll "click" with you, especially if you're new to the series. At least, that's what happened to me.
Jordon	Not Recommended	31.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jordongamer123/	At the moment I enjoy the game but its so a lot of problems mostly with multiplayer sometimes you just keep getting errors that dont allow you to join your friends or your friend will get kicked at some point in the fight.It is a good game but it needs a lot of fixes I am not recomming it at the moment because of the multiplayer problems

Mr.Potato	Recommended	120.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roomy04/	Well as for a ex-monster hunter player from Playstation 2-PSP and finally PC this game is really nostalgic my good old memories of this game from when i was a child it is really recommended from ex-players or newcomers and also as for the graphics setting for now is not so bad i say but the negative thing for this game is the connection to the server it always disconnected every 10-15 minutes of gameplay that needs to be fixed.So enjoyment score overall for this game is 8/10 i think that was all from me looking forward for future updates of this game.Thanks

It's like every christmas wish since I was 5 has been answered. This is to all the nay sayers out there talking about connectivity: Is it really that bad? (No) Is it really worse than the other AAA multiplayer titles when they release? (Not even close) Is Capcom actively working on fixes even the minor connectivity issues people are having? (Yes) If you love monster hunter, and you love gaming on the PC, this game should have a very, very special place in your heart.

DarkFenix	Recommended	227.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkfenix2k5/	The pros:Well, it's Monster Hunter. It's finally come to PC, where it should stay.The cons:Well, it's Capcom. That means an otherwise excellent game marred by sloppy QA, lazy porting, and slow patching.Overall:In spite of the game's technical flaws (for me it crashes a lot when minimising, and is always disconnecting) it's still awesome fun, still worth buying (though not at Steam's exorbitant price, seriously, go to other licensed sellers), and definitely still worth playing.
Michael Westen	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/neal1231/	Great game! It is my first Monster Hunter and it is a great experience! It has a few issues on PC like the random network drops however, I think it's probably from the fact that over 200k people are playing it currently. Some people are complaining of FPS issues and I recommend turning off volume rendering to increase FPS. I'm currently running 1440p @ 100 FPS with drops when the monster has certian effects like ice.Overall, I highly recommend this game.

Oats Monster	Not Recommended	201.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042662296/	Everyone is complaining about how poorly optomized this game is and how bad it runs, which is all true, but the real problems are in the gameplay. (I understand this is MH but wow it sucks)-not able to cancel attack animations to dodge-input lag, specifically if you hit the attack button twice, you will attack twice in the same direction even if you really needed to dodge and smash the dodge button while the first attack animation is going-♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting and the characters make exaggerated facial expressions during cutscenes, its cringey-horrible controls that feel very awkward and slow-terrible online, constant disconnects and errors-unable to type messages, have to scroll through menu's just to say your premade hello macro-bosses that will stunlock you and instakill you-unskippable cutscenes to do basic things like get food or build a pair of pants-clunky walking controls that constantly conflict with combat and sheathing/unsheathing your weapon-cant do things with your weapon out, must wait a full second for the sheath/unsheath animation-sometimes your character just really doesnt want to take their weapon out or put it away-sometimes your character will turn and attack in a completely different direction while fighting (this happens A LOT)theres plenty more. at this point im only going to keep playing out of spite because i bought it and cant refund it because the first 2 hours were mostly cutscenes and very little actual gameplay that didnt let me know how clunky this game was going to be.oh yea and no health bars on  bosses (yet you get weapon damage numbers that pop up when you hit) so you have no clue how much to the fight is left. Especially since some bosses will start limping like you got em down to low health but then keep fighting for another 15 minutes.this game ♥♥♥♥ing sucks. dont make the same mistake I did.

LurkusMcGurkus	Not Recommended	9.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LurkusMcgurkus/	It's a very fun game and it runs fairly well on my old(ish) laptop.Here's why I'm not reccomending it:>No way to turn off motion blur. Motion blur really bothers my eyes.>Keyboard and mouse is garbage, the game tries to make the mouse emulate a joystick instead of taking raw inputs.>even more DRM>not enough character customization sliders and options. Why can't I change my character's height/weight? Why are there so few hair styles? Why couldn't we have sliders for everything?>Can't rebind buttons on controller.>The controls/camera are somewhat clunky>Painfully long tutorial>The game seems to like to take away control of the camera, especially to focus on something that isn't you.>It really does feel like a console game from 2012.I'm sure a lot of my discomfort with the game is the result of my computer being well below the recommended specs, but given what other people seem to be saying, it seems that at the core of the issue is that it was a lazily done port. DId they waste too much time trying to integrate denuvo into their game? All that aside though, as I said, the game is very fun: If I could turn off motion blur, rebind controls on my controller, and if keyboard and mouse were properly implemented (i.e. not just trying to emulate a controller), then I could probably recommend the game.My specs:GPU: NVidia Geforce GTX 870MCPU: Intel i7-4810MQ @2.80GHzMem: 8GB DDR3HD: Samsung 850 EVO  SSD
Morr-gan	Not Recommended	38.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/buttfeathers/	I only don't recommend this game for PC.Get it for a console if you can.This PC port has odd perfomance issues. There are times when it'll stagger and sputter the FPS down to 1. That's right. A whole single Frame Per Second. Sometimes when I'm going through my inventory selecting my equipment it'll stutter down to 10 or 15 FPS.The Server issues currently are... rediculous. If you're unlucky you'll be seeing the "Communication Error" error every 20 seconds, even though you're just trying to play solo. Though, Personally I think that might just be ye ol' "more players than we accounted for", though at the same time, it should've been obvious this game would've been a huge hit, as it was on console.If you can get it on sale, go for it. They'll fix the game eventually. If you can buy it now and stomach the weird performance issues and server issues, go for it.I don't like having to say "no" to the recommendation, even though i'm very positive towards this game. It's mostly just for the sake of people being able to see this review.

Rampskii	Recommended	33.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rampskii/	6 Days after release, a diamond stuck in coal, crumbling when not handled with care : Being completely new to the Monster Hunter series and having this game as a first experience feels like an amazing ride through the wild lands.Going to write some positives and negatives so prepare.It doesn't take long to get sucked into the universe that is Monster Hunter World.It's easy to see that the developers of this game are totally immersed and passionate about the mixture between full fantasy and prehistoric world creation, however there are a lot of rough patches.PROS :- carefully crafted and well designed world biomes- crazy weapon posibilities, allowing for a wide variety of playstyles- tons and tons of armor sets for both players and your cat companions- progression that seems to fluctuate depending on the monster you'll fight- wild monster fights with players and NPD(inosaur)s- Funky player & cat animationsCONS :- New player learning curve going all over the place- Horrible / Vague menu structures- unpredictible animation behavior- combat system / explanation is 100% missing from the intro's- cut scenes that are unskipable and preventing multiplayer access- not to forget the multiplayer components that are haywire, unpredictable and simply not finished.The game is a recommendation, however, take a breather when stuff goes wrong, most Con's will probably be patched.i hope 
Socially Acceptable	Recommended	115.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Str8WhiteMale/	Alright, for the first time in my gaming career I'm going to give a serious review.First of all, some addressing is in order: 1) All you connection issue people? Stop writing negative reviews regarding a problem that the Capcom team is working on fixing. All online games have connectivity issues at one point or another and you are supposed to be writing a review on the game itself. 2) All of you "bad port" people? You have no idea what you're talking about. Some people are having no problems with framerate or playability with this game and their specs and some people are having some problems. It all is dependent on your HARDWARE. If you bought crappy off-brand hardware of course you're gonna have problems.And now to the review: Back when the Nintendo Wii was still putting out games, my two brothers and I pooled together our savings and bought Monster Hunter 3 Tri. Thus began a love for this series with all three of us. Capcom has been a little sketchy with universal releases and once Monster Hunter: WORLD was announced, we were all stoked. We bought the game once it released on the PC (even though I was worried I wasn't going to be able to run it on my lower-end computer) and have been going through the game together.My specs: Processor - AMD FX-6300 RAM - 8 GB of RAM Video - GTX 750 ti 2GB Story - This game has a way more in-depth story than any of the previous games and it is very enjoyable to play and read the dialogue.Graphics - I can run on mid settings with a solid 30fps (good enough for me). The look of this game is beautiful even on these settings. My youngest brother can have uncapped framerates on his 1060.Connectivity - I have only had one issue with connectivity when playing with my brothers. We reloaded the game and it was fixed. Also, for those who are having this issue, Capcom is fixing it so PLEASE stop giving the game a negative review due to ONE issue with the game.Playability - Overall, a great port (if it is one). But, I kind of doubt it is a port because it took them 7 months to bring it to the PC?Overall, this is a great game and I am looking forward to future DLC. Don't listen to those negative reviews.

EarlZ	Not Recommended	263.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/earl088/	I havent played the game for an extended amount of time so I will reserve my actual game review for another time but the technical issues this game is facing is more than enough for me to give it a negative review- No raw mouse input- Unable to disable Motion Blur and Depth of field- No 21:9 support- Texutres are not loaded correctly- Full screen issues- Connectivity issues- Poor over all performance despite having a decent graphics card and CPU
Lunaus	Recommended	138.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LunaGoreTV/	I'd like to start this review off by saying this is my first Monster Hunter game I've played and stuck with. A group of friends played it religiously on the Nintendo DS/Wii-U and due to the size of the screen on the DS and the lack of a portable way to play the game at a friends house (usually only 1 TV, and/or Wii-U), and the controls (Wii-U controller sucks) I decided to wait until they released a game for PC. I did play for a time on the PS4 but again, waiting for PC release.Now that the game is on PC I have a new group of friends to play with and we all love the game at its core once everything is working/functioning correctly but there are issues going that need to be resolved to help damper the frustration that is caused due to online multiplayer.Here is a list of PRO's and CON's. PROS  Action Combat with a camera pan lock-on system Quickplay mission system: Hunts, Slay, Capture Multiplayer capability with the Quickplay missions & Story missions Clutter free UI Difficulty scaling Variety of armor, weapons, and skills for different and balanced builds This'll be my second time starting MHW but on PC. It's fun and the game gets progressively more interesting and innovative as the story goes on. I haven't had any issues with gameplay in terms of skill usage, weapon/armor usage, or any other major portion of the game. The monsters are all categorized and similar based on their type but unique in their own respect with strengths and weaknesses which make them fun and exciting to fight, they all have set patterns depending on damage dealt or other factors (large/tougher monster entering the area) but they're not choreographed so watching for queues and tells is still a major part that all hunters should be aware of.The progression of hunts, and the transition of maps with differing gatherables that are unique to that area as well as some of the monsters that can spawn, the need to go back to hunt previously hunted monsters, discover new monsters spawning in the locale that are fiercer also adds to the challenge that scales with your Hunter Rank (HR) and party size is refreshing to.Overall balance between weapons, armor, skills, etc is also nice with the trend of FOTM happening in the MMO scene this puts the players play style first and foremost and makes any build viable in the long run, while also not forcing players into specific roles but also lets them know (through monster dossier) what they excel out in terms of damage output on a monster. CONS  No update to the menu trees, everything is buried and it's optimized for PC use Change to squad system and removal of squad sessions; Steam Groups replaces squads Lack of fluid M+K use, mouse movements try to mimic controller joystick and stutters Lack of an in-game way to change controls for controllers; Forced use of Steams Big Picture Mode Unable to join Story Missions and view the cutscene as a group; Forces solo play or roundabout means of playing with friends Tutorial is long and is not intuitive, lack of key elements to get hunters use to the UI, Party Play, etc Lack of tooltips for items and descriptions for some items; For example the Dash Essence (sp) does not have a clear description of the intended use but after fooling around with crafting I found it makes Dash Juice which helps with minimizing stamina use The game also has some other issues with connectivity, I'm unsure if the game uses P2P or has dedicated servers but connections during private sessions with consecutive missions with the same party (potential with randoms too) cause a disconnect after so many missions which results in a new session needing to be made which also brings back to the point of the removal of squads and squad sessions. This issue is currently being investigating but should be noted until it has been patched.The UI isn't cluttered but the menus are annoying to sort through while on PC, console it was ok because there's not much else you can do console wise but there should be a different setup for PC. Most games allow a menu system where each thing is its own icon that can be selected as soon as you go into it (Esc/Start) although not that great for quick-select during missions it is easier when in the main hubs or at a camp. I also think they should change the auto creation to effect your item box as well if the crafting list can only be use items that have been placed in your item box.There needs to be more options for those with disabilities, such as a color blind feature or anything that allows the colors to be tweaked for certain alerts/triggers that help hunters during missions that would otherwise be missed by those who are unable to visibly see those colors, or the colors aren't what others see which makes explanations such as the BBQ Split difficult to convey or when you Brace/Move while mounted on a monster.

Saito	Recommended	98.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039459510/	This review based on the game version from 2018-08-16. Further patches may change some points of this review. First, let’s talk about the technical aspect of the game. Yes, it is true, the PC port is far away from being perfect. It is poorly optimized and you have to find the perfect setting to achieve stable fps. My advice: Turn off “Volume Rendering Quality” and limit the frame rate. The graphics are good, but do not justify this high hardware demand. Additional this game doesn’t have 21:9 support and there are connection errors in the multiplayer. Nevertheless, it is not as bad as you could expect after all the bad reviews, it is playable, although Capcom needs to fix the problems as soon as possible.Second, let’s talk about the game itself. The gameplay is very good – smooth combat system and thanks to weapon diversity you have many playstyles. The core element of hunting monster, gathering mats and improving your equipment is highly motivating and offers plenty of playtime. Unfortunately, I need to criticize a few things. Lack of some important endgame content (No G-Rank), monsters and locations. It gets repetitive quickly. The story is not even mediocre it is just bad, luckily is not a story-driven game, so it is not very problematic. Mediocre soundtrack - I mean it’s alright, but nothing you will remember in a few years. Annoying  decoration system. Even after all the criticism I still would recommend the game. It’s a good game, but in the current state it has his problems. I don’t regret the buy, but I still feel a little bit disappointed, because they throw away so much potential and it could be such a better game with a few technical fixes and gameplay adjustments.

Saph	Recommended	375.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chiprw/	Held off on writing a review until I finished the story.First and foremost, there is something you should be aware of before purchasing:-The cutscene after the final story monster can allegedly corrupt your save. Simply back up your save beforehand to avoid losing progress. It's under C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\userdata[YOUR STEAM ID HERE]\582010\remoteNow then, onto the port. The game has run beautifully from start to finish on my little old 960 with a mix of medium to high settings. A solid 60fps ensured that every hunt felt incredible, from flow to mechanics to just enjoying the stunning environments as I bashed Azure Rathalos' stupid noggin in.Make sure to check your specs on the store page. If you aren't up to snuff then it's not a great idea to buy the game.As for the game itself, well.Monster Huter World is the most recent addition to the franchise, it boast much higher graphical fidelity, greater quality of life features and most importantly, no zone transitions between areas.I went in blind on day 1 and immediately got hooked, taking out low rank relatively quickly and having a blast while doing so. From Jagras to Magdaros, every fight felt unique and challenging in their own ways. The monsters themselves feel much more responsive than previous games and some are pretty challenging if you haven't done your homework on them.As for gear, the team did a fantastic job of reimagining the movesets for weapons. Adding in new combos and mechanics that make them all feel organic to the combat as a whole. I started with the trusty Insect Glaive which boasts a new aerial dodge, new attack animations for the ground and air combos as well as a new elemental/status/healing bug swarm foe the Kinsect to summon. Once hit, the cloud of bugs will apply whatever damage, element or effect your Kinsect is alligned to and they can make for some great combo extenders and openers.About halfway into High Rank I switched back to my MH3U main, the Greatsword. Oh boy, the new greatsword... They added a shoulder tackle that you can use to cancel out of your charged swing or out of a roll as a quicker way to reach the new finisher that does some pretty big boy damage and feels incredible to land. The addition of aerial combat as introduced by 4 has been expanded upon too, when you jump off a ledge there's a brief window where you can hop in any direction when you begin the aerial swing which can be used to combo even the hardiest monsters into submission. Plus you can now charge your aerial swing which allows for greater damage and a higher chance of mounting the monster.There are a number of new mobility mechanics that make the game flow so much smoother than older iterations, my favourite being the slide. When you sprint or roll on a slope your character will slide down at incredible speeds. You can even use new slide attacks out of it and some can even be charged or have a follow-up move.There's also a grappling hook that makes climbing feel much faster as well as it's utility in the newest addition to your hunter arsenal, the Slinger. This little wrist mounted crossbow type weapon can be used with any weapon type and has a ton of ammo types and the ability to grapple onto special grapple points in order to swing around some areas for quicker movement and a nice evasive/offensive option in fights.The slinger boasts a ton of ammo types, including things like throwing knives and various pods used in previous games. There are a number of other types that can be found in the environments including ones like: -Brightmoss, which glows and sticks to whatever it hits, useful for pointing out monster weak points to inexperienced members or just for lighting up dark areas.-Stone, becuse who doesn't love flinging rocks at monsters? Useful for drawing agro and knocking down certain flora which includes some other ammo types.-Scatternut, does a lot of stagger damage and can be useful for extending your friends' combos as they go to town.-Slinger Thorn, sticks to the target and can be hit to deal additional damage. Useful for monster parts that bounce some weapon types and for breaking parts in general.-Watermoss, deals a small amount of water damage and can be used to wash certain dirty monsters for easier damage. There are many more types all with unique effects and utility, making the Slinger an incredibly useful tool for hunting and exploring. Some more fantastical than others, but they all have their uses.Now for quality of life.The first thing I checked was item sets, these are useful for hunters that like to save time at the item box between hunts. Although for another point, camps also have item boxes now. You can enter your tent to change gear and access the item box mid hunt. To make them even more useful you can now eat at camp, meaning if you forget to get your pre-hunt grub on you don't have to worry about being at a disadvantage any more. Oh, and you can fast travel to your camps from anywhere on the map.Moving on, there's the item wheel. This handy little guy lets you quickly use specific items on the fly without cycling through your entire inventory. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that this feature is a massive help to the Sword and Shield as it is the only weapon that lets you use items without sheathing it first. It also let's you use the slinger while it's drawn which is great for setting up combos.I also want to talk about how decorations and charms work now. Instead of the traditional points system, abilities now use levels. Say you have a Fire Res decoration, it'll just give you a level in the Fire Res skill when slotted instead of just 2/5 points needed for the first tier of the skill in previous games. Decorations also come in three sizes and as such, so do decoration slots themselves. Meaning the bigger the decoration, the more levels it will provide in the skill it gives.Charms are more or less the same deal, they give specific abilities just like decorations but now they can be upgraded depending on the type. These additions really streamline the skill system and make for a much easier time going for a build you want to use. Armour also functions in the same way, but now there are set bonuses on some sets. Unlike other games though, most don't require you to wear a full set, but rather just 2-5 pieces of the set. This allows for much more freedom without making it feel like a chore to go for specific setups.The verdict, All in all, I'm really enjoying my time with MHW. Connection issues aside it's a fantastic port of a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Couple that with Capcom releasing existing console events and DLC quests for free at a faster rate and you've got a pretty good deal in my book.I will say though that I do have a couple of minor peeves with the game. The first is that the faces look pretty bad up close and the second is the lack of unique weapon designs. Both very minor things, but they do detract a bit from my personal experience.I can't recommend the game enough to anyone looking for a fun hunting sim/ARPG hybrid. There's plenty to do in the game which makes it a great time sink too. Just make sure you can run it before purchase and all should be well.We even just got a patch to address the connectivity issues that were present at launch within the month of release, that's what I'd call consumer friendly.TL;DROnline can be pretty bad at times currently with disconnections from Steam, but the game itself is incredible and completely playable solo. It's well worth a buy in my book and I'm dying for more content already.If you like to hunt, or play good ARPGs, get it.
Helmic	Recommended	442.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Helmic/	It's an absolutely brilliant game, the most fun I've had in a game in years, with even its most complex and fiddly bits seeming to have real purpose in either driving long term satisfiaction in progression or pacing the game to space out the adrenaline-pumping highs with quiet or relaxed moments where you just need to sharpen your weapon, heal up, and then track down that boss monster again to continue the fight.It's also a game that gets some very critical things wrong in terms of usability, with multiplayer in particular showing the game's online heritage as a Nintendo exclusive.  To have a friend join you in a storyline mission that has cutscenes in it, you must first start the mission, progress far enough in that mission until you have seen all the cutscenes (which can take as long as 20 minutes to accomplish as you'll often be told to find something with limited direction before the relevant cutscene plays), and then you ahve to abandon the mission and then recreate the mission again so that your friends can join.  Oh, and all your friends have to have seen the cutscene as well themselves, so they all have to be doing the same thing, no exceptions.  This means that playing with friends in anything other than postgame content almost prohibitively time consuming, and since the main campaign where all these shenanigans occur can easily last you 40-60 hours (I'm 90 hours in at the time of writing this review and I still haven't beaten the main campaign yet) a lot of people simply will never reach a point in the game where they can just play the damn game with friends.And that's assuming your connection keeps up.  For what seems to be a peer-to-peer game, everyone I play with suffers from constant disconnections despite clearly still being connected on Steam and on Discord.  Players who are disconnected are then forced to face a boss that's had its HP boosted quite a bit all by themselves. And if you fail the mission because of that disconnect, any resources you spent trying to boost your rewards like vouchers (you get only one a day and can only hold up to five) or investigations are destroyed.Oh, just to make things worse, those scarce vouchers and uses for your investigations are also used the moment you post a mission, whether or not you start it.  You often have to remake a mission because other players can't join it until its remade, so get used to having to choose between your friendships and your willingness to part with your last voucher.  It's needlessly vindictive and punishing for a game that's overly fond of crashing on many people's systems, there's no good reason that those vouchers couldn't just be spent the moment you get your rewards.But I still recommend the game.  It's not in as bad a state as the original Dark Souls at launch, and it's an utterly brilliant game.  It's hard to know what to gush about first: the sheer variety in playstyles afforded by the fourteen different weapon types that all almost play like unqiue genres of games, the exquistiely paced boss fights that alternate between quiet tracking and gathering and loud and bombastic combat, the loving detail put into everything that makes the forests sway in the wind and interact with your hunts or how a Tobi-Kadachi will leave those marks on the trees you find by using them to scratch itself in a lovingly rendered animation, or the massive variety in weapon and armor assets that all have their own niche uses that give you an excuse to collect them all and theorycraft new hyperspecialized builds meant to play a specific role against a single boss, or how item-only progression fixes a lot of problems with level-based progression in RPG's by removing problems like overlevelling or shoehorning you into a specific playstyle forever...It's so hard not to gush about the brilliance of the game, and that makes it so much more painful that the port doesnt' quite do it justice.  It's not even that bad a port, my game has only crashed once in 90 hours of play as I'm using a CPU with FMA3 support - an AMD FX 8350, a CPU that generally doesn't do very good in games but holds a steady 60 FPS at 1080p with a GTX 1070, I can only assume the game's been multithreaded competently.  There's rebinding options and graphic options and little touches that make it clear real effort was put into the PC release.But the parts where it does fail hurts the most, because Monster Hunter is very much a cooperative game at heart and a game with such brilliant interplay between a team and a monster that could easily combo anyone to death that makes one wrong move just doesn't deserve the disconnects, the crashes, the performance issues on different PC's, the horrible UX problems for playing together, the mean-spirited wasting of vouchers and investigations when it's the game that messed up.I still recommend the game.  I still want people to try it, even if it's only for that two hour refund window, because Capcom has promised to support this game and I think people can still love this game despite its serious flaws.  There's just been so much love put into this game that you can feel, the real appreciation for having all these systems interact to create what can only be called fantasy nature porn.  There's what seems to be dozens of lengthy animations of cats cooking you food in the most flamboyant way possible for what amounts to just a buff, thousands and thousands must have been spent just animating that alone.  There's too much effort here to just dismiss it entirely.If the game works on your machine, if you have friends patient enough to deal with the need to use what are effectively even more annoying Friend Codes in a goddamn Steam game, if you like Dark Souls-like combat systems, if this game seems interesting to you, this is probably a game you'll want to pay full price for.  But if you're unsure, wait a few weeks and see if these issues have been addressed.
Bakapito	Recommended	193.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263320540/	After finishing Dark Souls ,Bloodborn,Nioh,Horizon Zero dawn i have to say that this game is Very good in terms of Content and gameplay.- The game is hard and it has its own unique gameplay based on how expirienced u are with your weapon and Very Focused on the items Use.You can use item for every situation and make your life easier or even to make things possible.- Sole reason of the game is to farm and grind, thing is farm is not like afk easy run like Diablo 3 etc, Its more like killing Dark souls 3 first boss but with the chance to get invated by one , two or sometimes even 3 other monsters + the Enviroment.- You dont have to worry about Game Content as it is enough for start plus there are Events with unique rewards at full time changing every now and then, and the fact that u know expansion patches will release to reach ps4 content.- Playing with Friends is very fun and there are even Arena challenges with ladders u can duo to.-Keybindings for Keyboard are not good but u can change everything. Controller gameplay is very good like every game that is released on Ps4.Overall-Gameplay 9/10-Content 8/10-Graphics and performance 6/10-Controls 7/10-Online Content/replayability 10/10
Bobsplosion	Recommended	207.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bobsplosion/	Now that the connection problems have been fixed, this game is absolutely recommended for any Monster Hunter fans, old and new.It ultimately fixes a lot of smaller problems from the older games and makes it much more accessible to a wider audience. You really feel like you're hunting a monster as you follow its tracks through a busy jungle.Hundreds of hours of content in here, although still lighter than previous generations. In the end it's still worth the experience.
Zee176	Recommended	282.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zee176/	This is my new favorite game. Its essentially MH with new interesting challenges and with a lot time wasting mechanics streamlined so you can enjoy hunting monsters without being distracted. The game also runs surprisingly well on my computer.The worlds now more alive with monsters interacting more with their enviroments, like fighting each other from time to time, and smaller animals crawling, and flying around doing their own thing, like swarming to pick at a newly killed monster. The maps are very diverse, and filled with plant life, along with all the different animals mentioned earlier, that can be used during the hunt to help, and give way to more strategies while hunting. The maps are no longer just flat, and actually feel like more natural inviroments. All these new additions to this MH title felt a little overwhelimg at first, but I quickly realized that they actually made the whole experience of hunting monsters a lot more interesting, and diverse. I love the old monster hunter, but when I go back I can't help but feel kind of bored. Overall it actually felt like I was going into the wild to find, and hunt these dangerous beasts. The only issues I have are the overabundance of particle effects which can be distracting and use up too much processing power. I wish they put a setting to remove, or at least turn them down. Lastly that I have to watch a cutscene in a certain quest before I can invite your friends to play with you in that quest, its not too big of a deal, but it does seem like an odd choice. And to address the the network problems people have been complaining about, all I know if I haven't had any difficulty playing with my friends online, except for the cutscene complaint.overall this port is a x100 better than something like the darksouls port, but its not perfect. I can only speak for my own experiences, but this is first AAA game that I've immensely enjoy in a very long time.
Saurok963	Recommended	218.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Saurok963/	Great game. Really enjoying it.There are a few PC related issues, like very low-quality textures (even when you have them set to high) but that seems to be a bug that they will hopefully fix soon. Mice have crazy input lag, but the game plays better with a controller anyways. Have also had some issues staying connected to other people, but that's something they've officially acknowledged and will hopefully fix soon.
Meconium	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jimevansart/	With any game that comes from a console, I am highly hesitant to purchase. This hits home though! Are there bugs? Well, what game releases and doesn't have them? Zero. So, there you go. Ignore a lot of the negative reviews. A majority are people upset at the anti-piracy software they use (which is causing zero performance issues), multiplayer issues (look up port forwarding?), or just general people trying to make the game run on a min-spec machine. My only complaint? Allow me to join missions with people that are higher than me in the story. Just don't give ME the credit till I've completed the story up to that part. I cannot believe some of these reviews. You own a PC, do you know how to even run it? If you want something to work without effort, get a console system and don't complain you are locked at 30fps. If you want run games at 60+fps with all the settings high...upgrade more than once every 10 years, learn how a PC works, and learn how to tweak your system. Seriously. I'm almost 50yrs old, and run circles around people in their 20s with PC knowledge. Game is good. Play with your friends. Enjoy. Look at the specs. Upgrade if you're below. Learn your PC. Win.
Masher_Of_Buttons	Recommended	306.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfninja101/	World is my first introduction to the Monster Hunter Series. I'm constantly impressed with its depth and combat.

Saito	Recommended	98.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039459510/	This review based on the game version from 2018-08-16. Further patches may change some points of this review. First, let’s talk about the technical aspect of the game. Yes, it is true, the PC port is far away from being perfect. It is poorly optimized and you have to find the perfect setting to achieve stable fps. My advice: Turn off “Volume Rendering Quality” and limit the frame rate. The graphics are good, but do not justify this high hardware demand. Additional this game doesn’t have 21:9 support and there are connection errors in the multiplayer. Nevertheless, it is not as bad as you could expect after all the bad reviews, it is playable, although Capcom needs to fix the problems as soon as possible.Second, let’s talk about the game itself. The gameplay is very good – smooth combat system and thanks to weapon diversity you have many playstyles. The core element of hunting monster, gathering mats and improving your equipment is highly motivating and offers plenty of playtime. Unfortunately, I need to criticize a few things. Lack of some important endgame content (No G-Rank), monsters and locations. It gets repetitive quickly. The story is not even mediocre it is just bad, luckily is not a story-driven game, so it is not very problematic. Mediocre soundtrack - I mean it’s alright, but nothing you will remember in a few years. Annoying  decoration system. Even after all the criticism I still would recommend the game. It’s a good game, but in the current state it has his problems. I don’t regret the buy, but I still feel a little bit disappointed, because they throw away so much potential and it could be such a better game with a few technical fixes and gameplay adjustments.
ไม่มีตังค์วื้อ Shadow of the Tom	Recommended	156.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redhot921/	I play this game in two version PS4 and PC so This game are pretty good. 8 months are worth for waiting but only one thing is Server that easily to getting disconnected maybe give dev a time and they'll fix it.เกมพอร์ตมาดี คุ้มค่ากับ 8 เดือนมาก ตอน PS4 มาแรกๆก็มีปัญหาหลุดกันเหมือนตอนนี้นั้นแหละ ตอนนี้ก็ยังมีบ้าง เลยไม่แปลกใจที่ PC จะเป็นด้วย ให้เวลาทีมพัฒนาซักหน่อย อาการหลุดคงจะเริ่มหายไปすてきなゲームです！私はこのゲームがPS4で遊びましたから、 PC バーションはとてもいいです。 でも 一つことだけ は 今サーバーは良くないんです 。

SectorOnPc	Recommended	88.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sectoronpc/	To start, my computer specifications are an 6 year old FX-8350, a 3 year old GTX 960 4gb, 24 GB of ram and installed on a SSD. Yes the game runs at 100% CPU and GPU, yes I would like it lower but I get nothing under 40-50 frames and it's stable. To everyone complaining multiplayer, yes it's an issue but it's been 3 days since launch. The devs, who by the way have never done a PC game before have done extremely well in my opinion. No I am not a monster hunter fan boy, I've never been a fan of the series. I find this game extremely fun and packed with enough content to get your moneys worth. I didn't know what Denuvo was until 3 days ago and I still don't care about it, I've not experienced any of the issues complain about in regards to it and I think most people are just parroting other reviews or the Controversy on Wikipedias page on Denuvo. I've gotten my money's worth with this game and will continue to keep playing it and supporting the dev's so they know that we are thankful that they put the game on PC and I hope people remember that updates exist and the game will get better. This review is of course my opinion but I don't see why theres uproar over seemingly minor issues.

Easy to play hard to master.
Loli Fondler	Not Recommended	89.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036997440/	Horrendous console port, with terrible UI navigation and UI animations. The game absolutely does not respect the players time with unskippable cutscenes, long animations for tasks you will have to do again and again.Being forced to sit for 60 seconds after a capture and do literally nothing, or worse yet being forced to stare at the failure screen and then the LITERALLY EMPTY REWARDS SCREEN before you regain control of what you’re doing.This game could be 9/10, it has amazing moments but the frustrations to get to them makes it a struggle not worth the effort. I haven’t even mentioned the grind, which this series is famous/notorious for. It would be more bearable if there was a simple “retry” button after a mission fail. Faints being shared encourages solo play, Stats/skills that shouldn’t exist, such as “earplugs” and slide affinity, it feels like they ran out of ideas so they made things that shouldn’t affect gameplay become annoyances that you have to gimp yourself to mitigate.This game shouldn’t have been ported to PC in this state.  
Sasori_Senpai	Recommended	112.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sasori_jap/	All of you giving this game a negative review just for one or two problems are pathetic manchildren.Compared to the PS4 version I played for 360 hours, it has:10-30X faster load timesA higher framerate at a higher resolutionThe ability to use the keyboard and mouse or controllerSteam friend integrationFree multiplayerEase of multitasking (tabbing over to a browser to check reddit etc)By all accunts the PC version is already the superior version.Yes the mouse could have been implemented better.Yes the performance could have been betterYes the servers are having a hissyfit right nowHowever, I feel just fine playing with a controllerAlso I can turn down a bunch of settings and run at 100+ FPS just fine on a 970And lets be completely ♥♥♥♥ing honest here. Not only did MHW have server issues at the launch of the console version, but I doubt that a single person will deny that a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of PC games had server issues at their launch as well.Are there issues to be worked on and fixed? Yes.But is it a complete writeoff of a port that's not worth playing? Not even close.

Goilveig	Recommended	238.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998334599/	Summary: Overall a fun game, but currently (week after launch) there are some network issues with co-op gameplay.  If co-op with random players is a key draw for you, you might consider waiting a week or two while they iron out the kinks.Basic Gameplay:Mostly this is a game where you hunt huge monsters for loot, craft gear with that loot, and repeat.  There are also many gatherable materials throughout the world which you will use to craft consumables, however you will have the opportunity to automatically gain 1-3 different types of plant or insect materials after each quest, so you typically won't need to grind for gathering spots too often.The overall monster hunt combat is an ARPG-style fight where you will seek to hit a monster's weak points while avoiding its attacks.  Combat is not quite as fast paced or fluid compared to ARPGs such as Nioh, but it's still quite fun.Pros: - There are a large number of weapon choices, each has a lot of depth to master, and the playstyles are very different, from the lancer carefully engaging from behind the shield to the insect glaive user doing aerial acrobatics and riding on the monster's back.  None of the weapon options are a bad choice, and you'll find something here to fit pretty much any playstyle. - Combat is challenging enough to entertain while being more accessible than the extremely hardcore ARPGs. - There's a lot of different consumables that can support different playstyles as well.  Except for elder dragons, any large monster in the game can be either killed or captured, for identical rewards. - The game can be played single-player (you can always have an NPC companion and can recruit up to two others during a mission), or with parties of up to four players.  Two-player is the hardest in terms of scaling, but I have played a lot of the game in that mode and it's definitely been doable.  You can play with specific other players or easily recuit (and be recruited) for random matchmaking. - Some of the fights can be pretty epic, even for the action RPG genre which is no stranger to over-the-top fights.Cons:  - The biggest cons so far are connectivity issues.  While I've had zero issue with friends whose online sessions I joined, playing with random players through the SOS system has resulted in about 10-15% of sessions disconnecting before the mission was complete.  This is likely to be something they fix soon. - Story is pretty minimal. It's there, but don't expect a masterpiece of storytelling.  At best the story is "passable".  There was never a point where I was excited to learn more about the lore or the world, though, which was disappointing as I usually like to get into game lore. - Combat isn't quite as fluid as other ARPGs like Nioh.

Michael Westen	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/neal1231/	Great game! It is my first Monster Hunter and it is a great experience! It has a few issues on PC like the random network drops however, I think it's probably from the fact that over 200k people are playing it currently. Some people are complaining of FPS issues and I recommend turning off volume rendering to increase FPS. I'm currently running 1440p @ 100 FPS with drops when the monster has certian effects like ice.Overall, I highly recommend this game.

Cageymaru	Recommended	83.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/76561197978381846/	First of all let me state that the game has connection issues with the Steam servers.  That is not a good issue to have in a multiplayer title.  Now with that out of the way, this game is FUN!  Absolutely a hoot to run around jumping on monster's backs and chopping them to death!  The "busy" work in the game is fun also as I like collecting stuff in the game world.  Honestly I can't recommend this game more, but remember the connection issues.As far as multiplayer goes, the story mode really should allow 2 players to complete the quests together.  That's unacceptable.  Capcom should rethink that decision.  I have had zero performance issues running the game on my AMD Ryzen 1700 and Vega 64 setup.  Now Capcom really needs to figure out the server issues to make this game great!

Sephon	Recommended	113.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000135680/	It's Monster Hunter.You kill big bad monsters with complex movement patterns and behaviours with one of the 14 weapons which also have complex and deep combos, techniques and abilities.There's many layers to the combat too, you can choose to be sneaky and try and trick your target into traps or trick it to eat poisoned/drugged meats, or simple get the target into another monsters area to initate a turf war to help you with the hunt.It's an amazing game that accomodates you no matter which pacing you have, play it slow and sure or fast and loose and the game will award both playstyles to a degree.The servers suck and even 1 week later there's hardly and difference, there's mouse smoothing/acceleration that makes KB+M not as fun as it could be, there are rumors that a few textures aren't loading the hi-res versions of themselves so we're stuck with the low-res. Hopefully that'll be fixed, but that doesn't make it a bad game, just some early issues that NEEDS to be ironed out.
HangInThere	Recommended	116.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106974750/	Overall a stunning game that brings in the feeling of nostalgia from back when i was younger. But the problem arises when i try to connect and play with my friends. We seem to get disconnected in the middle of the hunt. Is this a problem for other players as well?
Aspersio	Recommended	128.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/g0g3t4/	Man was it the wait for a Monster Hunter game to finally be on PC (excluding overseas Frontier and Monster Hunter Online). This game definitely has the scalability for a variety of specs to have the game look like a 3DS, to insane levels of supersampling to cripple the best of hardware. The game is essentially series of boss fights among a variety of different monsters using large weapons and tools for up to 4 players in a quest. After fighting smaller monsters, gather their parts and create equipment from them to fight even bigger beasts to make better gear. It's a great gameplay loop for a game with very in-depth combat.The game's got some network problems of random disconnects however. The main story quests have such an unintuitive way to play in a co-op with a friend as all players need to start their quest alone and only after watching all the cutscenes are people able to join, or re-host for party play. It's almost better to avoid co-op play for the main story, and begin playing with others once that is done.The mouse has some unusual acceleration tied to it and no way to change to a raw input. Controllers are recommended as the game was originally a console release earlier this year.Overall the game is great and the hope is that Capcom will update and improve the port as opposed to other japanese developers that release a PC port and never patch the bugs or problems.
Hank Hill	Recommended	123.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thenksboi/	A lot of people seem to hate on this game because of bad optimization. the first area seems to be where the biggest issues are. apart from that the game runs fine, no server disconnects and no random crashes. the gameplay itself is a lot of fun, especially with friends. i highly recommend it if you like action-like RPG/grinding games.
signo	Recommended	72.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/leong1/	Amazing game, don't get me wrong, but UNFORGIVABLE server issues make it impossible to play online with others, which is a shame because that is the more fun aspect of the game. Ridiculous outdated menu systems and not being able to see people in the Headquarters make a game which has 300,000+ active players feel so empty. Overall for what its worth, I'd still recommend the game. It is Monster Hunter on effing PC and it's better than ever. But prepare to be frustrated over the server disconnects. So sad and disappointed to see such a great game get ruined by garbage servers. I hope they fix this soon. They have to.

Although I can't say I have been experiencing any of the issues others have been facing, if you're on the fence you might want to wait for those to subside before purchasing.

Rezbit	Recommended	157.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShiKage08/	This game is amazing and I would recommend it to anyone. I have played every release since Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate on the Wii U. This game has a few really good quality of life changes to it and a few new mechanics that enhances the gameplay. First of all, the sharpess meter on melee weapons show the amount of sharpness is left per level, which is a significant improvement. Now, you don't have to predict when your weapon might drop in sharpness - you can just see dwindle down. Next, the open world allows for much smoother gameplay. Before, you would have to suffer loading screens between sections of maps - even if they were small - but now you can just run wherever you want, whenever you want. This makes tracking and following monsters much easier.On the subject of tracking, I thought the new footprint and scoutfly system would be a "watering down" of the formula that has been so successful, for the sake of new players. However, it's very intuitive and convenient. If you wish to avoid using this, you just don't have to investigate footprints. A lot of the quality of life changes makes inventory management as well as other things much more simple and convenient. The whole experience is fun and action packed. Aside from a few technical issues the game has, it's one of the best games to come out this year.On the subject of performance, I haven't had many issues. In fact, I was pleasantly surprised, hearing how bad it was for others, when I loaded it up on my four year-old PC to have it run nearly flawlessly at max settings. Occassionally, I will get a frame rate dip down to the 50s, but most scenarios keep me in the ballpark of 58 to 61. My specs are as follows: GPU: EVGA GTX 980ti ClassifiedCPU: Intel Core i5-4670K at 3.4GHzRAM: 12 Gigabytes DDR3Hard Drive: Standard Hard DriveOperating System: Windows 10This game is: ★★★★★

Ratbag	Recommended	85.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ratbag31/	This is my first Monster Hunter game I've ever played, and I had no idea what I have been missing out on. The monsters, the weapons, the combat, the visuals, it is all amazing. I've seen many people complain about internet issues, and yes there are some issues relating to connections to other players, but it's not as frequent as everyone has been saying. Either I'm lucky or something but out of the 44 hours of playing I have disconnected maybe 5 times, which isnt an issue because you can just restart the mission no problem. The game is optimized fully, the game runs at a constant 60 with my rig, and the keyboard and mouse support is great, I thought I would have to switch to a controller, however I feel the keyboard and mouse controls are smooth and work well.To put it short, this game is amazing fun and works well. I am glad to finally play a game that I have heard so good about.
Midnight	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198800835084/	This game is great, so much content in this game, very interesting monsters and fun to fight and various way to play with all the different weapon in the game that I am able to see myself playing this game for a while, worth it.
Fufol	Recommended	201.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fufol021/	A good game, but a bad port at the moment. Nevertheless, I enjoyed every minute of it while playing with my friends. Hope they fix the issues though
Dorfelsnorf	Recommended	128.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dorfelsnorf/	Issues:There has been connection issues from steam's end and alot of players are having a tough time playing together, apperently. Have noticed DCs when you alt tab from your game from time to time, hardly noticed it too much for it to be anything other than an annoyance.Other complaint people had is with radial menu and controls. Unless you haven't played anything on a pc before, you can find that customizing the controls and chaning radial menu to keyboard fixes it, jfc.Great game, very easy entry for people new to the series. A bit unfaithful to old time fans but this is supposed to be a breathe of fresh air. Fully happy with the money value and there's still so much♥♥♥♥♥♥to do.

Mogelfur	Recommended	78.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052953648/	Keep in mind that currently I am mostly playing Singleplayer and have done so since Monster Hunter Tri, 4U and so on for the 3DS console system.This game is a monster hunter game which eliminated a lot of hassles normaly (and silently endured) encountered in the other games. You don't have to carefully handpick needed objects before the start of the quest since you always bring your Box with you to a quest, buffing by eating a cooked meal is also possible on the fly and you don't have to stand still to consume items. So far, so easy.Monsters are still challenging, although I fear that the game itself might have become less complex. Which is okay in my opinion, since the quality of the game itself is still quite high. The game conveys a much higher sense of a breathing and living ecosystem than, for example, ARK. Ever watched a scaled wyvern-like huge reptile taking a bath and giving its best impression of a pidgeon in a small pond? Now you have the chance to do so.Controls for uninitiated are usually difficult to learn and to master and if patience is not your virtue, you might not get a kick out of this game. Especially since Multiplayer is still very wonky. However, I frequently make similar experiences with my 3DS system, so I don't care that much about MP disconnects and inconveniences on this matter. In my opinion this is critique on high levels.Recommended!

Azure	Not Recommended	29.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/twisp_supernova/	I'm one of the people who didn't have any issues just starting the game up and having it run smoothly on my rig with no setting tweaks (although turning off the volumetric fog ironed out a small wrinkle in the framerate and looks nicer this way honestly).  That said, I still don't recommend this game.I mean, just because I didn't have an issue with that doesn't mean it isn't an issue.  It sure seems to be, so thats something to consider.However, I _personally_ don't recommend it because this is literally just the console release with 60 fps.  What I mean by that is it is still riddled with all of the problems the console version has.  Namely, unbelievably spotty online.  I'm not even halfway to high rank and on 4 seperate occasions my friends and I have had someone in the group lose their connection to the session.  When this happens they end up playing the rest of that mission themselves while we play the remainder of that same mission ourselves as well.  They can't leave the mission and rejoin us.  Once the connection is lost, thats it, the mission is pretty much worthless as the experience of doing it with your friends cannot be salvaged unless the entire group restarts it.This is something I thought they were going to fix considering they delayed the PC release to iron out the bugs and make it a worthy port.  We have been trying to close and reopen the game to fix a variety of other issues such as: -Can't find friends under 'friends sessions' when friends are definitely online and in an online session with open space-Can't use the 'invite friends' button when in the game online and in an open session.  Game doesn't explain why.-Using the 'invite friends' button (when it makes itself available) doesn't work sometimes?-'Failed to join quest' when attempting to join a quest your character qualifies for.  Not even an error code for this one.  Retry a dozen times with the same results.  Leave the session only to find out now you can't rejoin the session.  Finally, they REMOVED functionality for clans/groups.  In the console version you can make your own clan within the game (was not integrated with xbox/ps4 friends) that you could invite players to and when you went to play online another option alongside 'friends sessions' was 'group sessions' and you could then join an anchored session that only members of your clan/group could join.  This made it really easy to have friends just automatically join you without needing to be manually invited or otherwise have their hand held to get them in your room, which could be useful if you were already in the middle of a hunt and can't stop to invite them.  This all gave clans a small sense of identity within the game as well.  You could also be part of multiple clans and join any session at your leisure.How it works now is groups are integrated with steam groups.  You can set a steam group you are in as your primary group and it accomplishes nothing because there is no 'group sessions' option anymore.  Unless someone is on your friends list, they can't automatically join the session you have created (if they can find your session at all anyway) so friends of friends that might be part of your clan are out.  It's extremely frustrating which is why I am here now hoping to deter you from buying this game because quite frankly Capcom had a little more than 7 months to fix this as they promised and they have appeared to have done literally nothing because I'm getting the same buggy experience I had with the console version.  So when they said the reason for the PC delay was to make sure they have a smooth, bug-fixed release, I guess they were just talking out of their♥♥♥♥♥It IS a good game, Monster Hunter IS a good series.  Capcom needs to smarten up.  If they don't care, then I don't want them getting any more money than they already have for such a pathetic, amateur job like this.  I'll change my review when they deliver on their promise of a good port.  I guess if you enjoy playing games alone then the lack of online isn't going to bother you but these games have multiplayer rooted in their core so it is a very major problem.
crying orange	Not Recommended	322.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964119379/	For as big a company as CAPCOM to take 2 days to even ACKNOWLEDGE their terrible connection issues on a franchise that is known for and almost BUILT around Co-Op for a port they delayed for months to "get it right", is absolutely unacceptable. I've spent about half of my time getting disconnected and trying to reconnect with my friends. If a fix doesn't come within next 3 days I won't be changing my review, very unacceptable. From what I understand the console took an entire month to fix their connectivity issues and that's ♥♥♥♥ing ridiculous.Nice game CAPCOM, nice multi-million dollar company you have there. Dauntless a F2P game run by a company a fraction of your size got their stuff together faster than you.NEW EDIT: It's been over a week, and CAPCOM has not fixed♥♥♥♥♥♥yet. They are OFFICIALLY slower than the creators of DAUNTLESS.

[Линн]	Recommended	68.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/re_lynn/	For new players, MHW is not really welcoming, lots of tutorial & stuff that you might be missed in the early game, mind the tutorials and look up some guides in the internet, don't be lazy, unless you want to be stomped out by some monsters.User Interface is seriously overwhelming (for me), hidden info/stats, etc.Control is very clunky with K+M, i recommend using a controller.
annakincho	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/annakincho/	There was a lot of hype for this game, but I was disappointed to see what it was. To be fair if you have the time to spend on it, then I would say its a good game, but if you cannot commit and invest in it, then I would pass on it. One of the issues of which I am refunding the game is the no ultrawide support. I mean I am playing games from 2005 that run perfectly fine on 21x9 aspect ratios, and it is kind of unacceptable in 2018 in a AAA game to not have that not even with an external fix. Another bad thing (at least in my mind) is the never ending tutorial, the 1 hour of playtime I have is literally just cut scenes and you walking from A to B. I believe there is more of a tutorial, and you cannot make up your mind whether you want to continue or refund based on the 2 hours of gametime. On another note I was very disappointed with the combat system. I was expecting something cool, but if felt very clunky and meeeeeh. I have discussed this with people that have invested a lot of time in the game, and they mentioned at the beginning it is indeed bad, but once you get used to it, and find the right weapon it becomes amazing. Well I would say for me this game is a bit of a let down, and I will be passing on it. Hopefully this was a helpful review!
kEN	Recommended	166.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lmken/	It is a game that you play with your friends and you make a session on your host or your friends host which is nice because it have self host connection and the game itself has feature of either doing side quests helps you getting materials for your gear + you can help your friends on their hunt awhile you are doing side quests with them on the same boss, but the game loses the feature that real co-op on adventuring on same quest hunt/capture for example a boss called baranoth you need to finish the quest alone or using SOS flare which 3 more random players helps you on the quest or a friend that did the quest already and you can't proceed together as start fresh until some of you step ahead or step behind I rate the game 8.5/10 because I like hunting monsters and also capturing :D but if they allow co-op on the same quest would be awesome, but still the game is really nice never expected would come out like this

LoneWolf Zeb	Recommended	330.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zebx/	Fifth Fleet, I welcome you to the New World!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1522743406This is the first Monster Hunter game that I've played and the first released PC version of the Monster Hunter franchise. You play as a hunter of the Fifth Fleet and tasked to discover and solve the mysteries of the New World.I usually wait for sales before but this is the first game that I've bought a game exactly when it was released. Although this is my first Monster Hunter game I allotted some of my time to take a look of the previous games. Aside from the improved graphics/visuals from the previous games the gameplay really improved a lot as well. There are different kinds of weapons that you could choose from each with different play styles. You can fully customize your gears as well, mix & matching them with the skills and deco slots that you need. You could also change your sidekick Palico gears as well. So far, I have tried most of the weapons and change loadouts depending on the hunt I am doing. You are free to choose if you only want to use one specific weapon or try all of them.You could go full fashionsouls and flaunt in your guild card with a matching pose you want!https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1514644134The story is ok but It falls of short to me since that's what I'm looking for in games. But I think MH is the endless hunting of monsters praying to the RNG Gods to give you the decos that you need. I think we couldn't get bored with the games as long there some continuous updates with new monsters and also season events. Right now, only the console have the season events but eventually it will be on the PC version as well.But for me the real end game is... P E T S ! ! ! Hahaha! You also have a room that you could put pets. You can move into bigger rooms as you move on with the game. The bg music and the ambience of the room is so relaxing that you could just sit on the bed or the garden all day.My overall rating: Where's my drago-9tor?! over 10!

Slightlyoff	Recommended	207.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Slightly_off/	Some people have had problems with the game performance. I really haven't. Yes it's not well optimized and yes my cpu usage is high but it's not so bad that it deserves a bad recommendation.Why you might ask? Because the game is amazing. There are so many different and challenging monsters to hunt. The 14 weapons all play so differently from each other that you could play the game through 14 times and it wouldn't feel like you were redoing it. And because of this the grind takes a very long time to feel like a grind. I'm at 123.4 hours and I'm just now starting to feel it but I have so many different weapons to explore that I am okay with it.The world is beautiful and feels truly lived in. The soundtrack is pleasant and appropriate.Yes, the game has problems and for that I would never give it a 10/10. The port has problems. The mouse controls aren't optimal however I find them acceptable never feeling like I NEED the controller. I have used M&K for all 123 hours. If the port was perfect though. It would be a 10/10 without hesitation. One of my favorite games ever and certainly my favorite monster hunter, although full disclosure the only other one I played was the Wii one.

ScorpionGod	Recommended	114.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkorpionGod/	Never thought I'd play this type of game before watching PS4 version gameplay on YouTube. I pre-ordered the PC version a week or 2 before the actual launch. Funny thing is, MHW PC was my first game on Steam, first game I ever pre-ordered and first game I played on Steam.My experience is so far AWESOME. Even though this is my first ever Monster Hunter game, I was able to quickly catch up with most basic and repetitious stuffs. I played fine all alone till Anjanath came out of nowhere to faint me twice and that's the moment I tried playing online.Connection wasn't stable in the early days and today I rarely see any issues in online play. I love this game and that must be why I was doing late nights ever since August 9th slaying monsters. Playing solo is hard for monsters after Anjanath the first time, but once you catch up with their pattern, it's not a big deal. You can ENJOY a lot when you play online with friends and random people. I mean when you slay big monsters in just 2-3 mins, that's amazing and fast.When you use Dual Blades, it becomes SO FAST!!BTW, one thing I dislike is the font used in options. When you compare that with other games, you feel something is missing. ;)
Kim Jong-un	Recommended	143.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128047541/	Love this game. LOVE IT.Problem is the connectivity issue. Despite having God-tier internet, playing with coop disconnects me and/or my friends, its annoying.

All content updates will remain free.Turn off Volume Rendering for more FPSI've been playing the monster hunter series for years and years, 1000's of hours across the games, The game feels so much smoother and more satisfying to play than the others, The only thing it's missing is the amount of content the previous ultimate installments of the game have [Not by much!] But more monsters and content have been coming into the game almost every other week, So it's only a matter of time until this installment of the game is packed with plenty of various monsters to hunt.The only real complaint i have about the game is in some weapon trees there is 1 weapon that is just bluntly better than all the others in the weapon tree [But most of the weapons in the tree are still really good and extremely well useable, just there is one that is fairly stronger than the rest for no real reason as to why it should be that much stronger] and there is no cold/snow area which means a lack of ice/water elements, I hope sometime in the future they add a snow/ice mapAll issues from what I've seen have been fixed, Ignore the mixed reviews as the game should be mostly positive, it's a bunch of people forgetting about it or refusing to change or delete their negative reviews that were complaining about the connection issues, all the issues have been patched and everything is working properly.

The Doctr	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adoctr/	Excellent game. The PC version has some buggy features but so far Capcom has done a good job to address them.
JamesWarlord	Recommended	200.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JamesWarlord/	 Recommended only to a certain type of player  TLDR; at the endMonster Hunters have always been the same type of game, a hunting type. What does this mean? It is a "painfully pleasant grind", like the one Warframe lovers experience (here you don't have a foundry with timer, but a macho smithy). Do you need equipment? Hunt for it. Can't hunt the monster you need? Hunt another to get better gear and then hunt what you need.Players will complain about  difficulty  and endless  grinding , but hey, that's what the game is about, if you make every single dragon an easy fight and make all your needed gems 100% drop chance, you will have everything in no time and uninstall it in 3 hours or refund.Get this game only if  you do not mind the grind and can tolerate frustration. The monsters will kill you, they will roar in the middle of your godly combo, they will hit you with the last pixel of their tail when you have 1hp.  All this is part of the game .I absolutely do not recommend this game to the "button smasher" type of player. Want a hack 'n' slash full of combos? Go play Bayonetta or something similar, here you will get punished if you attack nonstop. Random Thoughts Online:The first day I couldn't play online at all, now I haven't experienced a communication error in days, they are fixing stuff fast.Hackers:They exist, but you rarely or never see them online and they cannot give you any benefits. If you try to hack you just kill your gameplay, don't do it, it will be like hackers in Dark Souls, full of items and nothing to do.RNG:Decent, you have ways to get stuff, most of them include killing monsters. Example: "I need this tier 8 gem that will never come out from the melder (it is the grandma with the cauldron that resembles a gem gacha)"; Good news! There are some missions that will have higher chances of giving you the gem, so you have 0.81% instead of 0.27% chance of getting it!  There are lots of gems so expect those percentages for getting the super ultra godly rare tier 8 you want  (you will get them eventually).Whining:Many people do it, don't listen to them, if they whine 24/7 it is because they are the type of player that shouldn't have gotten this game.Price:Could be lower, it is a good game where you shouldn't regret getting it full price anyways (if this game fits you of course).Gameplay:GOOD! But! I really suggest playing with controller, best recommendation 10/10 fav +1 rep like sub. It is playable with keyboard and mouse, but you will have a "full experience" with controller (Radial menu can be changed to keyboard and mouse just in case, read the first tab of your menu.......).People:If you really want to enjoy the online play: 1) Play with your friends!  (ha ha) 2) If no friends, join a MHW PC discord, there are lots with friendly people willing to help or struggle with you. and you don't need friends for those ;_; TLDR;   Get it! specially if you like/tolerate grinding, it is a good game that will be getting better over time.  DO NOT  get it if you have little patience, can't tolerate grindy games or love doing unlimited combos (Killer Instinct player will get infinte combo breakers here).PS: Not all the monsters are dinosaurs, I promise.
ApolloMan	Not Recommended	38.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092057137/	I have been playing monster hunter since monster Freedom Unite on PSP and I have pretty much played every game in the series since then. This game seems like the next logical step in the monster hunter series. One does not need to have a wiki in  order to really get into the nit and gritty of the game. The combat seems much more fast pacedI really enjoy this game...when it works. It seems that my mates and I experience connection issues everytime we play. We often get so disgusted with connection issues that we just have to stop playing. The game looks decent enough for being developed on an older engine. Graphical performance has also been underwhelming due to the fact that my gtx 1060 will go from a solid 45-50 fps to 10-15 fps at certain points, and especially while using dual blades. I have noticed other people experiencing similar performance issues. Until these issues are fixed, I cannot recommend this game.

Aside from that though, this game is awesome. Really well done and I am loving playing it. It doesn't deserve as low a score as it has just because of the connection issues and once they fix it, likely like 90% of those people that gave it a thumbs down for that reason won't fix their reviews...
Archon	Recommended	68.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchonFTW/	Game is fantastic, most people who have issues with this game are not running it on powerful enough hardware its as simple as that. Some texture stretching, on higher resolutions its more apparent but for 1080p game looks great. Had a hiccupy launch but not the worst ive seen, with over 200k on launch day im supprised multi even worked at all.
Zauren	Recommended	105.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zauren/	The reviews have been divebombed by ruined expectations. The online experience might not be 100 percent ideal, but I've primarily soloed and have had massive amounts of fun. I also know people who have duoed since Day 1 successfully. Just keep in mind this is 'Mixed' not due to gameplay but due to multiplayer; if you're not interested in that, it's one of the best games out. If you think Dark Souls is rough, wait until you run into an Anjinath when you're only wielding an Iron II weapon. Or the first time you think 'I have defeated Legiana, I can finally take on a Diablos'. Or 'This Kirin sure looks harmless, this will be easy'. Or...

The Poor Gamer	Recommended	39.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/poorgamer82/	Monster Hunter World has finally come out on the PC! A mostly seamless port, with the only problem being the servers. You will experiance disconnects, as the servers struggle to handle the massive amount of people trying to all play. Plus, the recent steam update hasn't helped. However, there are people working on ways to fix this problem. And their solutions can be found in the discussions if you bother to look. Or you can be like those people who simply want to complain about server disconnects and the anti-piracy software installed with the game.
JackMit96	Not Recommended	44.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JackMit96/	    First let me start by saying I love the game and the monster hunter series, here are just a few things that I think need to be sorted for the PC port.     The PC port is a bit jagged, need to sort out the frame rate throughout the game as it jumps and drops throughout the hub and in the various areas. But when you're in the gathering hub or arena, the frame rate is lovely.     As well as that, I think that they need to add 21:9 support for all of us ultrawide monitor users. I think this would make the game much more enjoyable as I do not like seeing black bars on the side of my screen. Especially when playing this amazing franchise game.    Once these changes are made, I will be changing my review to positive as they can add so many things to make this port even better. Thank you for bringing Monster Hunter to PC!
Dinge	Recommended	207.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095949221/	Work around for two common problems on MHW PC Port1. Disconnect from the online session Try turning off your steam friend by setting it to offline.2. Horrible mouse control and camera decelerationSet your in game camera control to Max (Default is 50), change then open cofig.ini which is inside your MHW folder which is under steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World and change the MouseBaseSpeed to 0.2 (Default is 2.0), this will govern your in-game sensitivity.
おっぱい Clearly™	Recommended	65.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ClearlyTM/	Am not experiencing connectivity issues since the Aug. 23 patch, a very solid multiplayer experience. My internet speed is 14MB/s down, 5.5MB/s up. As of this review, I have 25 hours on the game, and have done an upwards of 100 multiplayer lobbies. So far, I have DC'd in the middle of just 1 of them. Only 1 of them and this is from a pool of 100 multiplayer lobbies. I would say they have fixed the connectivity issues, but I am just one opinion of many. Others may feel like this game is just as broken as it were when it first launched, but I say this is a very enjoyable game with friends and strangers alike. Aside from the connectivity being fixed, this game is jam packed with a variety of activities to do in the many zones avaliable (I'm just 25 hours in and I feel like I'm not close to beating the main questline yet). Missions range from killing small creatures, to zone bosses, to arena with bosses, to time attack, to open world exploration, to a lot more. As you play the game you unlock more missions that not only let you discover new materials for new armor/weapons, but some of these materials can be used to upgrade the quality of life things at the main town.Gameplay is fun and extremely engaging with both the environment and players (the game heavily rewards those who explore the world rather than those who rush through the game). Utilizing the environment to gain the upper hand, when defeating bosses will make the fight a lot easier. Using the SOS flare to get people into your quest/expeditions not only enhances your experience, but challenges you as well. Movement is fluid and feels very much like dark souls, where you would do 1 2 strikes and roll out of the way and do more 1 2 strikes again and then roll out of the way. If you're feeling confidient, you can do your hard hitting attacks that would leave you vulnerable to incoming attacks. There is such a thing as "animation trap", where if you do an attack or action, you would be stuck in that attack or action animation until the animation is done. This is very important because it forces the player to be smart with their actions, so its not just a mindless button mashing hack and slash game. The community is helpful and will try to cooperate with you. From my 100 multiplayer lobbies, I have not ran into a single troll. Those who join you to aid you will actually aid you.Lastly, controllers arent required, but would make your combos a lot easier to do. I've found little to no issues with keyboard and mouse, however keyboard and mouse do require you to be more precise with your inputs to achieve what you want to do.
teamultraforce	Recommended	66.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/teamultraforce/	Monster Hunter: World is an AMAZING addition to a series I love, and adds yet another level of depth to the already deep combat. Even with all of the negativity surrounding this game, I would 100% recommend it. The issues that are facing a lot of people are being addressed by Capcom and the modding community, so I wouldn't write this game off just yet. It's only been one working day. That being said, let me go through my pros and cons:Cons I've seen:- Disconnections (has only happened 3 times in my ~14 hours of playing)- Trying to use Steam Chat while in fullscreen (the game will disconnect you and STILL not connect you to chat, but Discord works better and doesn't have this problem so it's not a huge issue to me)Pros:- Game looks gorgeous- Monster AI & damage numbers make them into all-new threats. Old monsters that used to be easy like Rathian and Rathalos are no longer easy- The QoL changes make many assorted things about the game quicker and more easily get you back into the action (ie. radial menu lets you choose items faster, you can sharpen your weapon without sheathing, the slinger stuns monsters that run and cause them to continue fighting you for a bit longer)Once again, I would recommend this game 100%. Don't give up and refund because of an issue that you face! Capcom (and modders) are working on fixes, so it would be worth your time to stick around and voice your issues so that they can help with fixing it.

(90% fixed as of 8-28-18) quicker than many games that had similar issues.Also be aware this game is CPU intensive your i3 or equivalent is going to bottleneck your performance in parts of the game.I have this on Ps4 (200+ hours on Ps4) and PC and since my rig can handle it and gets comparable performance I now play MHW primarily on PCThere's never been a better time to join the Hunt.

The game itself is good and fun but the network issue makes it a real turn off. Wait for the game to be patched like most PC games. Funny enought the same thing was going on PS4 when release. I would have hoped that almost 1 year of PC developpement would have fixed much of theses issues guess not.
♤ S p a d e Ƨ ♤	Recommended	94.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Baze_the_Spade/	FinallyFor anyone that hasn't played any Monster Hunter game:The essence of this game is exploration, grind, and hunting. The world is beautiful as the life within it. You research the thick jungles for species you never met, you see them interact within their habitat and learn how they live, and how to track and hunt them. The exploration is good enough for me to be going on expeditions w/out even picking a mission, just to explore the habitats. Monsters are a blast to fight, and the more you upgrade/progress the bigger ones you hunt, which adds an ongoing excitementThe gear system is grindy, so be prepared for a long game that repeats itself, at least in a fun way. You basically hunt specific monsters from which you can extract materials for your gear, and after each mission you usually are able to upgrade your armor pieces and maybe even your weapon, but hunting monsters is your MO, so you don't have to go out of your way for mats for a big part of the game, however approaching end game will have you grinding a LOT.Combat is awesome as expected. You have a satisfying balance between swings and mobility, meaning the game has a fluid and strategic combat flow, not favoring mashing at all. Monsters have their own habits and approach, and you can exploit weaknesses (like breaking their legs) or use various tools (like paralyze shots) to take them down, all of which fun to do. They all have different ways to defend themselves as well, adding complexity in the way you approach and fight each one. The weapons are ridiculous and fun to use due to vastly different playstyles, so much so that it feels like a different game with many of them. The story is beyond me, as with previous MH games tbh. I get the main part, but I ultimately don't care, cause it's kind of poorly represented, and everything else is way better, keeping my mind completely off of it. That and the fact that it randomly disconnects are my only complaints so far, but tbh I been doing all my missions solo, and it's perfectly doable, so not really an issue for me, just a nuance That being said, I can definitely see many ppl not liking the type of combat, or even game it is in general, so be cautious. This is one of those games that you'll either love, or be completely indifferent about. Definitely recommended to ppl that already know the series and like the combat style

ヒロ カザワ ◥► ◄◤	Recommended	328.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hirokazawa/	Mhw reviewThis game is amazing.. im a MH veteran player and out of all the MH series this is problably the best ( my opinion) I have no problem with the game . Although the online connectivity is messed up but i dont really mind (because im a solo player so i dont really mind about the connectivity issues). But i you really do mind about the connectivity issues because you want to play with your friends, you should wait a little longer until they fixed it.This is problably because theres a lot of player playing online at once because the game just got releases about 1 week ago.I get it that there are some players having a lot of problem like corrupted data once u beat xenojiva and etc. i advice you to back up you game data ( it should be on the internet how to do it). But overall this game is still great
Tubbymora	Recommended	132.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tubbymora/	It appears the Great Jagras is no longer mating with the servers.... haven't experienced any crashes or issues with the online.

Grizzly	Recommended	71.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198082758958/	This game is extremely fun and staisfying to grind. I have absolutely no problems with the game not ran into any bugs at all this one guys review names so many things that are specific to his setup bc he cant run it on his big monitor lol I think its funny and he says there a lot of max settings graphic problems ummm I havent seen it I run this game in full ultra uncapped and runs perfectly fine and the game looks gorgeous and I also get up to 150 frames so I think most the people that complain about the game is specific to their setup and cant handle the game and I play with a full squad in multiplayer and we had one disconnection when we first started but have not disconnected since.
Terminally Nerdy | CBSA82	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cbsa82/	I am brand new to the series, and this is my first entry.  I only have 4 hours so far but the depth of this game blows me away.  I learned about this by watching CohhCarnage and ProJared play it back when it was on PS4, and I knew then that I wanted this game in my life.Now I have it, and I just cant stop playing when I get a chance.The lore, the world, the visuals, all excellent.  I cannot comment on the online play as I am primarily a solo player at the moment (due to weird time periods when I can play, and having to stop / start a lot) but I hope by the time I decide to try it will be fixed.The game is demanding, I can only run it on Medium at 1080p, and I get 45-60 FPS depending on whats going on.  But its still crazy good looking even at that.Also the keyboard and mouse controls work super well for me.Loving this game, and cant wait to dig more into it.
여성 존중	Recommended	129.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rayndom/	At 116hrs and still trying to create my character; don't want to look dumb when hunting elder dragons.
Zee176	Recommended	282.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zee176/	This is my new favorite game. Its essentially MH with new interesting challenges and with a lot time wasting mechanics streamlined so you can enjoy hunting monsters without being distracted. The game also runs surprisingly well on my computer.The worlds now more alive with monsters interacting more with their enviroments, like fighting each other from time to time, and smaller animals crawling, and flying around doing their own thing, like swarming to pick at a newly killed monster. The maps are very diverse, and filled with plant life, along with all the different animals mentioned earlier, that can be used during the hunt to help, and give way to more strategies while hunting. The maps are no longer just flat, and actually feel like more natural inviroments. All these new additions to this MH title felt a little overwhelimg at first, but I quickly realized that they actually made the whole experience of hunting monsters a lot more interesting, and diverse. I love the old monster hunter, but when I go back I can't help but feel kind of bored. Overall it actually felt like I was going into the wild to find, and hunt these dangerous beasts. The only issues I have are the overabundance of particle effects which can be distracting and use up too much processing power. I wish they put a setting to remove, or at least turn them down. Lastly that I have to watch a cutscene in a certain quest before I can invite your friends to play with you in that quest, its not too big of a deal, but it does seem like an odd choice. And to address the the network problems people have been complaining about, all I know if I haven't had any difficulty playing with my friends online, except for the cutscene complaint.overall this port is a x100 better than something like the darksouls port, but its not perfect. I can only speak for my own experiences, but this is first AAA game that I've immensely enjoy in a very long time.

bsandro	Recommended	64.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bsandro/	Game is really good despite being somewhat different from previous Monster Hunter installations; even though some mechanics were simplified or removed the core of the game is still the same - pure skill-based combat.I encountered infamous connection errors just twice in ~60 hours, and while rare fps dips are present they are not as horrible as promised (Ryzen 2700, GTX1060).Played about 300-400 hours of MHWorld on PS4 and thought I'd skip PC version but it turned out to be really nice. Strongly recommending to anyone who like good action PvE games with good lore and cool mechanics.

Vault	Not Recommended	128.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AgentVault/	Server problems are to be expected but this game is not very playable with friends as of this review. There are far too many lost cnnections and furthermore you can become glitched out of rejoining with a "Failed to join" message every time. I'm sure these will be patched in time.By far the worst design part of the system is the onine session otions. You are limited to either "public or "private" and with the option for joinning friend sessions through steams system I am dissapointed with no option for a friends only session. This needs to change as everyone I talk to has the same opinion.Curently through private sessions you must start one, then go to the tab in your options and select the "copy session ID", then paste that out to all your friends forrrtheeem to copy and paste to find an join.On console there are squads to manage sessions but this is replaced with steam groups which is difficult to get lots of people in and currently has ZERO function in the game so all there is as of now is the private sessions.These are serious flaws that prevent me from recomending the game for now.
Safari_Jake	Recommended	46.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070247749/	I see a lot of complaints from normies and their toasters about the poor optimization but you can hear it from me, a guy who can actually run a computer, that these reports are demonstrably false. I was even able to run this game on my laptop (which threatens to explode in an IDE terroristic nature every time I start it up) by changing a few options. I have played this game for about 18 hours only at the cost of blood vessels bursting in both of my eyes due to my visceral primal reaction to the sheer volume of cheek blasting, skull cracking, and meat clenching carnage I unleashed on these drooling monstrous skin bags leaving me physically and spiritually blind which is the only thing slowing me down from spending the rest of my forseeable future playing this.On a more serious note, disabling volumetric rendering in the options and downscaling the graphics a tad will help with performance or maybe this is the wakeup call all you kids with your chrome books need an upgrade10/10
Turdle	Recommended	346.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198206683705/	The negative reviews are liars and haters, 99% of them have a game graphics setting somewhere or a bad grpahics driver that is causing low frames and crashes. This game is top quality in all respects, feels a bit like it's from 2015 or before but progress in the MH game line non the less. I can run this game on HIGH settings and I'm getting over 100fps consistently, pushing higher while idle.Review as of 1 hour playtime: As a MH game I would give this a 9/10. As an RPG I would give it a 7/10. (will update with 10-hour and 100-hour review)My specs: 16gb RAMi5 4430970GTXz97 board
Ensavier	Not Recommended	147.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972255740/	well I dunno what to say.  The graphics options and stuff don't seem to allow you to go 'very low'  but my pc is high end so that doesn't bug me too much, but if you don't happen to have a high end pc that can f you up pretty bad.  A 1060 and decent i5 setup seems good for running this at 1080 according to some friends.Speaking of which, what is HORRIBLE is attempting to play with friends.  We have utilized multiple things to try to help but god forbid if we attempt to play with each other. At least one person will not be able to connect even with session ID and all of that BS.I can literally make an Atari Jaguar CD to work but getting this game to function with a previously set up group is like trying to wake cuthulu with a Rubik's cube, duct tape, and only a single child sacrifice, while fighting Goku and fighting all of the bosses of the Souls series at the same time.  Oh and you're a quadriplegic attempting to escape a burning building, and no, there is no wheelchair.I guess if you just want to play with radom people it functions just fine, but playing with friends is something I'd expect a multi-million game selling sudio to have worked out a year after the initial release.  (actually I think it was a lot less than that but still).Having said that the gameplay is okay, if not repetitive (i.e. here is the same enemy in the same area over and over again have fun grinding).  If that's your thing more power to you, but again, you will need the assistance of a god several angels, Harry Dresden, and the power accumulated by sacrificing thousands of children if you want to play with your friends without crashing for an extended period of time which kind of ruins the game for me.  I draw the line at 5-6 human sacrifices to get my games working usually.  Thousands is way too many.  I don't have that much room in my basement.Graphics and performance:At 4k res and max video options with a 1080ti, an 8700k, 64 gigs of ram yadda yadda too much computer not enough real life it runs about 30-50 fps with a 1999 mhz gpu clock and a 5.2 ghz cpu clock with gpu memory being around 6 ghz and RAM running ~3200 mhz with extreme tweaking down to tertiary timings.  Generally during combat it hits mid to high 30s, which doesn't seem to be too much of a problem for the game's engine as I can't tell much of a difference between 30 fps and 60 fps unless I'm just spinning my camera like an idiot.  You would probably squeeze more fps out of it with less background processes than I generally run (I run lot of flashy PC 'make windows look nicer' programs which hit performance a bit) or by having only two ram ports populated and running 1T but I don't see it hitting 60 fps @ 4k res when things get busy without turning graphics down from the highest settings.  1080p and 1440p 60 fps seem easily attainable with my PC's specs.  On a side note my gpu clocks @ 2100 mhz are stable for the most part but after about 2 hours in this game it seems to crash.  Not as stable as I thought I guess.  It may be useful for stability testing a GPU overclock. 1999 mhz seems stable while playing.Right now I enjoy playing games like this with friends so I rate it as "not recommended."  If you don't mind dabbling in the occult, or if you don't mind that friends part I would say it's a pretty good port from the PS4 version.  I don't know about the xbox verison because I haven't played it.  It supports the PS4 controller right out of the box with no need for input mapper or anything which is a plus.  I haven't played the ps4 version very long as it was at a friends house and we left soon after my arrival.Since I only want to play this game with friends and I tend to not like to attract the attention of divine beings in order to get portions of games to work, I rate this at .84 stars.  Whoever ported the multiplayer should consider suicide due to family disrespect.

potatis_	Recommended	137.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/potato75/	The game came out about 2 days ago, and I already put almost 25 hours into it (I put about 75-80 hours on the console version). I think that just shows that I love this game.The gameplay is deep, fluid and fun, the gear progression is satisfying, all of the weapon types and skills are varied enough to pick a weapon and get skills that best fit your playstyle and it's an awesome and really fun coop experience....And you get to fight big ♥♥♥♥in badass monsters, of course.and the loading screens are also really fast.Only bad parts right now about this game is that the PC port isn't the best thing ever right now.The port is very demanding CPU-wise, so the performence can be all over the place for some people.The keyboard has some really weird binds, navigating through some menus on KB+M is annoying and the mouse movement in-game is not that great (Just be like me and most other people and use a controller!).Servers have also been inconsistent, randomly DC'ing from a session or hunt. (But that's gonna get ironed out after a few days, I hope).If you can get over these issues, get some friends together and use a controller, then it's a really enjoyable experience!!
thessiv	Recommended	195.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Thessiv/	This game is awesome!! Spent 450+ hours on the ps4 and have the means to increase those rooky numbers on the PC version ;DThe perfomance was really bad at first but i did some research and downgraded my Nvidia driver to 391.35, now the game runs smooth as butter. I get 75-105 fps ingame with everything on Ultra besides volumetric fog, which is OFF(game looks way better without it imho). I capped my fps to 60 and enabled V-Sync and now i play at a very stable 60 fps.
TGCid	Not Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tgcid1282/	Can't recommend this game until they patch the bugs out and get rid of Denuvo and just hogs you cpu.
ShadowNetBG	Recommended	45.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992288442/	Port might not be the best, but the game itself is absolutely amazing. You'll be doing pretty much the same thing - collecting plants, digging, cooking, crafting, chasing down monsters, it all feels satisfying and doesn't get old. The combat is varied and battles play out differently every time.If you're with a low-mid range pc, I'd suggest locking the framerate to 30 and cranking up the settings. The game will look nice and you won't have to suffer through fps inconsistency.
Cara Delevingne | CS.MONEY	Not Recommended	27.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaximusCrushus/	While I have played many hours of Monster Hunter World, and will continue to play I must say I cannot recommend it. With the already limited amount of Multiplayer this game has to offer the multiplayer that is currently in the game is basically unplayable. Friend and I go into a quest together and 10-20 minutes into the battle one of us gets disconnected from the server. The Game took 6 months longer to release then the console version and yet having implemented no working multiplayer is horrendous. With this being said. If the Multiplayer ends up getting fixed ill change my recommendation to Yes. But for now its a strong No.
xMarbela	Not Recommended	370.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054356396/	Until they Fix their servers and multi-player sessions, im gonna down vote this. yes, you can play solo ok, but when in multi-player sessions? slim chance for completing a quest with the team. also they should put up a reconnect option.

Doomesgaming	Not Recommended	83.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/doomesgamingtv/	As of right now i wouldnt recommend getting this game till they fix online play! Players keep losting connection during big fights against major Monsters and lose the chance of big loots and having the trouble in joinning back because its so difficult to join a party! It kicks you out and put you in offline mode were you cant do sos flares or try to join back! You have to abandon quest and restart to hop back online to find friends which you have to go through all that trouble again and repeat over and over! 
Quendorsof	Recommended	416.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999373821/	TLDR:Single Player is amazing.Multiplayer is okay but has room for improvement.Monster Hunter World is ana amazing game for doing exactly what the title tells you. Hunt Monsters. While at times it is a bit too obviously a console port with its incredibly awkward default keybindings or it not making use of the keyboard having, y´know, lots of keys, and making you first press one key to bring up your hotkeyd items bar and then another key to actually use something on it instead of having just one step for this or actually having changing bindings for the same actio thoughrout the game, left click for interacting with things in town and right click outside of town, what?None of these things take away from the fact that it is great to finally be able to play a monster hunter game with my mouse and keyboard instead of always being forced to have to deal with a controller. That said I would certainly hope that in the future more effort is put into making the PC version of the game at least feel like they tried changing it somewhat to adjust for it not being on a console.As for the gameplay, it is amazing to be able to fight the monsters on a big screen after several monster hunter games on the 3ds though after having played the ultimate versions of the previous games Monster Hunter World does feel a little bit lacking in the amount of monsters and would certainly be helped by having at least 5-10 more species or even just subspecies that are different enough to the current monsters. That said none of this takes away from the joy of fighting the monsters that are in the game currently.Sadly despite all the good things the one thing I really haven´t felt much enthusiasm with in this game is the multiplayer. When doing the main story quests all players need to play solo up till a cutscene for most quests before abandoning and joining on one if they want to play together which is clunky to the extreme, in addition to this sometimes joining mid quest doesn´t work with people in your session and we´ve also had frequent disconnections in the first weeks after launch though these have since reduced. SOS weirdly seemed to work better than joining mid quest on fellow session members though that can bring in random people which you might not want if you just are looking to play with some friends. Especially as it can happen that these random people will use cheats to for example instantly kill the monster to be hunted which kinda ruins the entire point of the game. So all this leaves multiplayer a bit of a mixed bag.All in all I would still recommend this game especially if you´re fine with playing single player part of the time as I have definitely thoroughly enjoyed it even with the rather low FPS my below minimum requirements PC managed to produce, but if you are mainly looking to play with friends do take into account that you may occasionaly have to deal with the game sometimes just being a bit of a pain for no reason.

SectorOnPc	Recommended	88.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sectoronpc/	To start, my computer specifications are an 6 year old FX-8350, a 3 year old GTX 960 4gb, 24 GB of ram and installed on a SSD. Yes the game runs at 100% CPU and GPU, yes I would like it lower but I get nothing under 40-50 frames and it's stable. To everyone complaining multiplayer, yes it's an issue but it's been 3 days since launch. The devs, who by the way have never done a PC game before have done extremely well in my opinion. No I am not a monster hunter fan boy, I've never been a fan of the series. I find this game extremely fun and packed with enough content to get your moneys worth. I didn't know what Denuvo was until 3 days ago and I still don't care about it, I've not experienced any of the issues complain about in regards to it and I think most people are just parroting other reviews or the Controversy on Wikipedias page on Denuvo. I've gotten my money's worth with this game and will continue to keep playing it and supporting the dev's so they know that we are thankful that they put the game on PC and I hope people remember that updates exist and the game will get better. This review is of course my opinion but I don't see why theres uproar over seemingly minor issues.

Just Slayer Things	Not Recommended	41.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198103212533/	As much as I love Monster Hunter and how fun this game is, with the newest patch I cannot recommened this game. The patch that was supposed to fix online connectivity has instead completely broken it for me. Since the patch I've only been able to connect to one lobby that I'm not hosting. Ports are forwarded, firewall exceptions are made, and I have a moderate NAT type. Before the patch I had no issues connecting to sessions or finding SOS flares. Now the game is a single player only and thats not the way to enjoy Monster Hunter.
RhastaPastaFucksta	Not Recommended	172.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OfficialProfileOfJY/	So after two weeks, you have 250k players and little to no SOS flares being fired. What the actual heck is going on? Only time when I get to do temper boss fights is when I post it with my friends.
Offiz Worka	Recommended	183.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ryzhkovvv/	What are you waiting for?! Grab it and play!The game is deep as an ocean, you can dig deeper and deeper liretally for years. Even if you won't like it from the first try - just keep looking. Monster Hunter series is among the best things happened in the history of gaming, and with World Capcom didn't &^%ck up. It suffers from some obvious porting issues - but who cares? It's full-on Monster Hunter, live classics, and it's looks better - and is more accessible - than ever.

I'm switching the Dub because the handler's voice is so god damn grating to listen to.
Bananers	Not Recommended	22.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065034840/	I wanted to like this game, I really did.I enjoy the very few times I have been able to hunt with friends. For a hunt with your friends type of game, this delivers very poorly on that. The fact that you have to watch cutscenes and then find that magical one that lets you send out an SOS Flare afterwards just so you have to exit the quest and then invite friends that has a 50/50 percent chance of actually working, is in my opinion, very abysmal.If we could be able to see friends in Astera, group up with them, and then go into the quest and watch cutscenes together, I think this game would be a lot better.Astera feels empty. There’s no life to it outside of the npcs that are stuck/tied to their own little area. The NPC do not move around. You can not see other people in your party unless you go to the gathering hub. What I would like to see is Astera be like The Tower, or The Farm in Destiny 2. Being able to see people and group up with them from the hubs would be a huge quality of life change for Monster Hunter World.The matchmaking in Monster Hunter World is worse than Dark Souls and Dark Souls is my favorite game series. Not to say Dark Souls matchmaking was too complicated; you just put some writing down somewhere in a level then your friend / other people find it and they’re able to join. In Monster Hunter World you have to jump through so many hoops just to have the CHANCE at playing together.Not to mention all of the other issues that plague this title including the need of 25 threads.The Weapons feel great to use. The combat is fluid albeit a little slow, but I still enjoyed it. Monster Hunter World has a visual aesthetic not often found in most games, which makes it beautiful. Crafting in this game feels good as well. There’s a certain gather hunt feeling about this that anyone can relate to.With all this said though, I can safely say I do not recommend this game in it’s current state. Maybe when Capcom makes it easier to join friends I will come back to it. Until then, I will continue to play other games and try to find other games to play.Final rating: 6/10

Just keep in mind this is 'Mixed' not due to gameplay but due to multiplayer; if you're not interested in that, it's one of the best games out. If you think Dark Souls is rough, wait until you run into an Anjinath when you're only wielding an Iron II weapon. Or the first time you think 'I have defeated Legiana, I can finally take on a Diablos'. Or 'This Kirin sure looks harmless, this will be easy'. Or...

Peter	Recommended	96.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071713751/	Monster Hunter world is an amazingly fun game. All weapons are fun to use, and the monsters are killer.

Smingleigh	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966299813/	I'm really enjoying this game. I picked up the trail of the Pukei-Pukei I was hunting, but found an Anjanath (think T-Rex) footprint right in the middleof the trail. I advanced cautiously, and found my prey already locked in battle with the Anjanath that towered over it. I crept forward, wanting to see how the fight was progressing before deciding whether or not to join the fray or find another target, when a furious Great Jagras steamed right into the back of me, getting the attention of the battling monsters. A rolling, tumbling, chaotic four-way fight ensued. During this a pack of regular Jagras weighed in, but most of them were stamped to paste by the Anjanath in short order. I think at one point I rode the top of the Great Jagras, stabbing it in the head. I know I cut off the Pukei-Pukei's tail. The last thing I saw was the Great Jagras eating the last of its kin to bulk up, mid-fight, but the Anjanath, finally tiring of the fragile Hunter, chomped me to unconsciousness. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get back into the field to see if the Pukei-Pukei survived. If it did, I plan to correct that situation, promptly.

Shara	Recommended	155.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197974927770/	This game is great.  Monster Hunter World has some great visuals and very tight controls.  It is not the most user inuitive experience for new-comers but I feel if you stick with it and give it some time to aclimatize to the experience that it will be rewarding.  This game can be brutal and quite difficult to learn, so as someone who loves a challenge this is certainly a game that I love to play.  It has wonderful visuals and tons of RPG elements and a fun grind to it gathering materials.  The game has had a rocky launch with lots of disconnecting which causes quests to fail or groups to disband when playing multiplayer(quite annoying).  I really hope they are able to patch all the server issues we've been having over the last couple of days.  Otherwise I would say this game is just great aside from those particular problems with the multiplayer.  I would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys a challenging repeatable game.

♤ S p a d e Ƨ ♤	Recommended	94.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Baze_the_Spade/	FinallyFor anyone that hasn't played any Monster Hunter game:The essence of this game is exploration, grind, and hunting. The world is beautiful as the life within it. You research the thick jungles for species you never met, you see them interact within their habitat and learn how they live, and how to track and hunt them. The exploration is good enough for me to be going on expeditions w/out even picking a mission, just to explore the habitats. Monsters are a blast to fight, and the more you upgrade/progress the bigger ones you hunt, which adds an ongoing excitementThe gear system is grindy, so be prepared for a long game that repeats itself, at least in a fun way. You basically hunt specific monsters from which you can extract materials for your gear, and after each mission you usually are able to upgrade your armor pieces and maybe even your weapon, but hunting monsters is your MO, so you don't have to go out of your way for mats for a big part of the game, however approaching end game will have you grinding a LOT.Combat is awesome as expected. You have a satisfying balance between swings and mobility, meaning the game has a fluid and strategic combat flow, not favoring mashing at all. Monsters have their own habits and approach, and you can exploit weaknesses (like breaking their legs) or use various tools (like paralyze shots) to take them down, all of which fun to do. They all have different ways to defend themselves as well, adding complexity in the way you approach and fight each one. The weapons are ridiculous and fun to use due to vastly different playstyles, so much so that it feels like a different game with many of them. The story is beyond me, as with previous MH games tbh. I get the main part, but I ultimately don't care, cause it's kind of poorly represented, and everything else is way better, keeping my mind completely off of it. That and the fact that it randomly disconnects are my only complaints so far, but tbh I been doing all my missions solo, and it's perfectly doable, so not really an issue for me, just a nuance That being said, I can definitely see many ppl not liking the type of combat, or even game it is in general, so be cautious. This is one of those games that you'll either love, or be completely indifferent about. Definitely recommended to ppl that already know the series and like the combat style

CaleoGaming	Recommended	117.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/caleogaming/	First, let me say - Do NOT mind the negative reviews on this store page. Most of them are people complaining about server issues or their 5+ year old PC not being able to run it. Now that's done with, let me say that I have 40 hours more clocked into this, than I did in the console version. I'm 44 hours in my savefile, and I am nowhere near being done with my playthrough. There is just so much to do in this game and even though it is a grind, it's not a boring one. It's fun, and like I said, there is so much to do. No matter if it's high rank or low rank, there is always new things to see and do. No fight is ever the same, something or someone is going to make that fight different. The greatest part yet has been hunting with my friends, there is nothing more satisfying than bullying a Barroth with a stun hammer and paralysis glaive + paralysis palicos. I actually felt sorry for it. The graphics could have been more polished for the PC port, but they are not bad. On Ultra settings, it holds a stable 80-120 FPS, the only thing causing frame drops at the moment seems to be thunder weapons. So if you are in doubt wether or not to buy this game - I would say go ahead and give it a try! And if you don't like it, you can always refund it. But this game certainly deserves a try! :)
Quibbles	Recommended	114.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quibz/	There are many settings that we should be able to tweak and edit (which is a reason for much of the negative reviews) but otherwise this game gives the classic Monster Hunter vibe.You can do just as much stuff in this as in any other MH + more like environmental traps. You can even shoot poo in the monsters face with the crossbow strapped to your arm if you wanted to instead of throwing it. Plus you can use the crossbow to swing from certain branches that have a bug on them.Another thing is they added new features to different weapons like the insect glaive that lets you evade once in the air after vaulting, letting you maneuver around the air better.Great game overall! Would recommend but devs do need to open up more options for us to tweak (like push-to-talk ffs)
Rick	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DatGuyAgain/	Hell yeah I've been waiting on this for a while, well made port with a constant good performance, for people who are getting turned off due to the mixed reviews, ignore most of them as they're not mixed due to the game being bad but rather due to some users not being able to launch the game, I understand that it's a dissapointing thing but this is just giving newcomers the wrong idea, so till this issue is resolved, hang in there people!
hmgirlpopuri	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024367877/	Janky keyboard and mouse controls, incosistent visuals.  Not really worth the purchase if you already own the console port unless you have friends you really want to play with who are PC only.
Neuro	Recommended	126.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Neurologicaldisorder/	The game has some release issues, most of which have been figured out, and have fixes available.I had an issue getting the game to run at all, but i fixed it with a bit of googling.The game is absolutely fantastic, looks great, runs smooth as butter, gorgeous environments, excellent gameplay loop.Genuinely, this could very well be the game of the year for me, most games are♥♥♥♥♥♥nwoadays, this got me playing until 4 in the morning.no game managed to hook me in like that for YEARS now.I absolutely recommend this game, go ♥♥♥♥ing play this♥♥♥♥♥♥If you're familiar with Dark souls, this game's easier than dark souls, but has a similar amount of challenge, but is a bit more forgiving, and there's a lot more to do in general, exploring is rewarded etc.bit of a disjointed review, but ♥♥♥♥ it, go play this♥♥♥♥♥♥
Khatsworth	Recommended	239.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Khatsworth/	Bought this on Humble Store; activated on Steam.So far, this game is everything I was hoping for in a Monster Hunter game for PC. Seamless mission zones, expanded creature behaviour, new mechanics, less portable console clunkiness, etc. It's great.There's a few nitpicks to be had with it for sure, such as not having as many graphic options as we're accustomed to on PC games nowadays, but honestly I've played some other console-to-PC ports before and this is one of the better ones, at least as far as stability and functionality goes. And the way co-op is done for story missions is a bit weird, but once you figure it out it's just a minor grievance. (gotta watch cutscenes seperately from your friend, then return to base from your solo mission and join your friend's mission after you've both reached the part at which SOS flares can be used). This only applies to story missions though, anything without cutscenes works outta the box for launching straight into with your friends.Lotta people complaining about the controls, especially keyboard + mouse, but I've actually switched TO them from originally starting with my Steam Controller just because it makes it easier to aim ranged attacks, and it works great so far. Anyone thinking of using keyboard controls needs to make a detour by the training grounds to learn how it all works. At this point it's second nature, but it did feel odd at first just because I'm used to playing these types of games with a controller. Compared to my time on God Eater 1/2, the keyboard controls in this game are *MUCH* better and more intuitive.TL;DR, if you're a Monster Hunter fan and you don't have super-high port expectations from Capcom (they've done worse than this before, lol), you'll enjoy this.
FwordBrandon	Recommended	1.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083792192/	So I’m gonna start off by saying I returned this, not because it was bad but because I had 400+ hours on ps4 pro and just didn’t have the time to do it again...that being said if you are gonna review a game on pc you should be #1 letting everyone know your specs #2 not be such a ♥♥♥♥ing cry baby about some drm ish just because everyone else is doing it and I know you lose 3fps but you prob shouldn’t be trying to run this 4K with a 2nd gen i5 and a gtx 780 #3 give a game a chance to be patched before you leave a negative review because as we know in 2018 nothing is finished but it always gets fixed at some point. Be happy its even playable or don’t first day ♥♥♥♥ing buy something and think hey this is gonna be perfect because I paid $60 for it. Nothing works like that anymore. Also GREAT ♥♥♥♥ING GAME 10/10.
didunoel	Recommended	186.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/noelrunes/	Great game great experience.  As of release date (8/9) it is currently having online issue problems but that's expected for any game that's as anticipated as this.As otherts have been saying, even with decent to good rigs, try disbabling the volumetric rendering.  It shot up my FPS pretty high and always at 60.
Boogsy Malone	Not Recommended	90.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeathByBagels/	Currently i would not reccomend the pc version of the game. It has a lot of glitches and connectivity issues that NEED to be fixed in order for it to be a fuctoning game.Aside from the multiplayer the single player is great. The only thing that grinds my ♥♥♥♥ing gears is the drops for crafting materials. Stuff you want hardly ever drops even if you smash the monster in the right places anjanath fangs for example are so ♥♥♥♥ing hard to come by.This game is great but at the same time needs soooooo many things touched up on and fixed.
Wolf	Not Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tensor2/	Laggy. 1024 maximum texture resolution. Is this 2001? Sound is off by 30+ seconds on cut scenes. Playing coop is painful and difficult; basically single player. Mouse acceleration cannot be disabled and motion blur cannot be disabled, making the game both ugly and unplayable. Don't waste a dollar on this.

The game itself is good and fun but the network issue makes it a real turn off. Wait for the game to be patched like most PC games. Funny enought the same thing was going on PS4 when release. I would have hoped that almost 1 year of PC developpement would have fixed much of theses issues guess not.
Dread Baron Beardly	Recommended	92.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067851126/	The connection issues are real but they do seem to be working on them. Aside from that though, this game is awesome. Really well done and I am loving playing it. It doesn't deserve as low a score as it has just because of the connection issues and once they fix it, likely like 90% of those people that gave it a thumbs down for that reason won't fix their reviews...
Archon	Recommended	68.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchonFTW/	Game is fantastic, most people who have issues with this game are not running it on powerful enough hardware its as simple as that. Some texture stretching, on higher resolutions its more apparent but for 1080p game looks great.

Shimoga	Recommended	201.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067105104/	Great game, probably best MH I've played. Lots of quality of life changes, which probably make this the easiest MH game to get into if you haven't played one before. There is much more verticality and interconnectivity in the map design as well and overall it really feels a living world compared to the older games. The number of monsters isn't too high compared to some of the other games but there's still enough for atleast a 100 hours of play time (is my current guess, from what I've played so far) I personally haven't had too many issues with frames dropping (pretty stable 40-45 frames) and I play on all high settings with volumetric rendering on highest as well. Few issues playing multiplayer online but not anything too annoying and they're already working on fixing it.

ヒロ カザワ ◥► ◄◤	Recommended	328.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hirokazawa/	Mhw reviewThis game is amazing.. im a MH veteran player and out of all the MH series this is problably the best ( my opinion) I have no problem with the game . Although the online connectivity is messed up but i dont really mind (because im a solo player so i dont really mind about the connectivity issues). But i you really do mind about the connectivity issues because you want to play with your friends, you should wait a little longer until they fixed it.This is problably because theres a lot of player playing online at once because the game just got releases about 1 week ago.I get it that there are some players having a lot of problem like corrupted data once u beat xenojiva and etc. i advice you to back up you game data ( it should be on the internet how to do it). But overall this game is still great
Tubbymora	Recommended	132.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tubbymora/	It appears the Great Jagras is no longer mating with the servers.... haven't experienced any crashes or issues with the online.

Zer0	Recommended	89.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ornerymind/	Don't pass up this game just because some Low-mid range PC owners expected to get 60fps on a brand new AAA game and got saltyAs far as the online, the game was so anticipated that Capcom had to spend two weeks setting up more servers and reworking how the network traffic works to fix connection issues. (90% fixed as of 8-28-18) quicker than many games that had similar issues.Also be aware this game is CPU intensive your i3 or equivalent is going to bottleneck your performance in parts of the game.I have this on Ps4 (200+ hours on Ps4) and PC and since my rig can handle it and gets comparable performance I now play MHW primarily on PCThere's never been a better time to join the Hunt.

Unn4m3d (♥AUT♥)	Recommended	111.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbarcode/	I wasnt sure what to give this game. It had terrible connectivity issues at first, and even as I write the review there are still problems with finding players.That being said: when you find a game, or you play with friends, it seems pretty much stable at this point, which in my eyes is a big improvement already.Now to the game at hand: I personally love it. I have never played a Monster Hunter game except for the very first one, on the PS2 I think it was, so Im not really what you would call a veteran. It is rather confusing at first, since the game throws tons of tutorials in your face (and that keeps going until you finish the story), but if you bite through it, its alot of fun.The monsters are great, they have interesting designs, and they vary greatly. You have a choice of 14 different weapons, which is alot to choose from, but you have a little training area in which you can test every one to see which one suits your playstyle.To make this short: its a game where you have to grind alot, but if you aren't totally against that it has a lot of potential, since fighting all the different Monsters is just plain fun.What I want to add is that (in my opinion) you should probably get a controller for this game, it IS playable with keyboard and mouse, but some weapons are really annoying with it, especially Ranged weapons.All in all, I do recommend it though.
Tony™	Not Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048150340/	Game itself is OK. Terrible optimization, cant play properly on my GTX 1060 6GB. Oh and also the constant crashing and connection errors.

The Poor Gamer	Recommended	39.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/poorgamer82/	Monster Hunter World has finally come out on the PC! A mostly seamless port, with the only problem being the servers. You will experiance disconnects, as the servers struggle to handle the massive amount of people trying to all play. Plus, the recent steam update hasn't helped. However, there are people working on ways to fix this problem. And their solutions can be found in the discussions if you bother to look. Or you can be like those people who simply want to complain about server disconnects and the anti-piracy software installed with the game.
Dinge	Recommended	207.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198095949221/	Work around for two common problems on MHW PC Port1. Disconnect from the online session Try turning off your steam friend by setting it to offline.2. Horrible mouse control and camera decelerationSet your in game camera control to Max (Default is 50), change then open cofig.ini which is inside your MHW folder which is under steamapps\common\Monster Hunter World and change the MouseBaseSpeed to 0.2 (Default is 2.0), this will govern your in-game sensitivity.

おっぱい Clearly™	Recommended	65.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ClearlyTM/	Am not experiencing connectivity issues since the Aug. 23 patch, a very solid multiplayer experience. My internet speed is 14MB/s down, 5.5MB/s up. As of this review, I have 25 hours on the game, and have done an upwards of 100 multiplayer lobbies. So far, I have DC'd in the middle of just 1 of them. Only 1 of them and this is from a pool of 100 multiplayer lobbies. I would say they have fixed the connectivity issues, but I am just one opinion of many. Others may feel like this game is just as broken as it were when it first launched, but I say this is a very enjoyable game with friends and strangers alike. Aside from the connectivity being fixed, this game is jam packed with a variety of activities to do in the many zones avaliable (I'm just 25 hours in and I feel like I'm not close to beating the main questline yet). Missions range from killing small creatures, to zone bosses, to arena with bosses, to time attack, to open world exploration, to a lot more. As you play the game you unlock more missions that not only let you discover new materials for new armor/weapons, but some of these materials can be used to upgrade the quality of life things at the main town.Gameplay is fun and extremely engaging with both the environment and players (the game heavily rewards those who explore the world rather than those who rush through the game). Utilizing the environment to gain the upper hand, when defeating bosses will make the fight a lot easier. Using the SOS flare to get people into your quest/expeditions not only enhances your experience, but challenges you as well. Movement is fluid and feels very much like dark souls, where you would do 1 2 strikes and roll out of the way and do more 1 2 strikes again and then roll out of the way. If you're feeling confidient, you can do your hard hitting attacks that would leave you vulnerable to incoming attacks. There is such a thing as "animation trap", where if you do an attack or action, you would be stuck in that attack or action animation until the animation is done. This is very important because it forces the player to be smart with their actions, so its not just a mindless button mashing hack and slash game. The community is helpful and will try to cooperate with you. From my 100 multiplayer lobbies, I have not ran into a single troll. Those who join you to aid you will actually aid you.Lastly, controllers arent required, but would make your combos a lot easier to do. I've found little to no issues with keyboard and mouse, however keyboard and mouse do require you to be more precise with your inputs to achieve what you want to do.

Yes the game runs at 100% CPU and GPU, yes I would like it lower but I get nothing under 40-50 frames and it's stable. To everyone complaining multiplayer, yes it's an issue but it's been 3 days since launch. The devs, who by the way have never done a PC game before have done extremely well in my opinion. No I am not a monster hunter fan boy, I've never been a fan of the series. I find this game extremely fun and packed with enough content to get your moneys worth. I didn't know what Denuvo was until 3 days ago and I still don't care about it, I've not experienced any of the issues complain about in regards to it and I think most people are just parroting other reviews or the Controversy on Wikipedias page on Denuvo. I've gotten my money's worth with this game and will continue to keep playing it and supporting the dev's so they know that we are thankful that they put the game on PC and I hope people remember that updates exist and the game will get better. This review is of course my opinion but I don't see why theres uproar over seemingly minor issues.

You bet it. - "We TaKe ExTrA TiMe To DeLiVeR ThE BeSt ExPeRiEnCe" BtW ! Maybe they use this time to negociate the DRM fees ;)- EA: Nobody can do worse than we did! // Capcom : Hold my optimisations!Okay, seriously now. As a MH fan & on 3DS' game player, I had great expectations about the game and it promised a lot and it's certainly the MH we need but not the kinda MH we know and were used to. 'Cause, the game seems good but is nearly unplayable : "Blur (nice dealiasing btw), weird mouse, weird camera, network issues, crashes (not me but adressed by capcom), paid DLC for emotes... I'm still looking for the 6 months optimisations they bragg so much about". Conclusion: It feels weird playing the game, very weird. Not everything is trash though and maybe when they fix the biggest problems it will be enjoyable, it will offer the best experience they promised us.

Don't get this game if you want to play with your friends because for an expensive game with such great potentials like this, you'd think they'd chip in to fix the most important aspect of this game which is the multiplayer function, but nope. They're just leaving us in the dust right now. Buy at your own risk.
TopLain	Recommended	111.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/toplain/	It's a bit rough around the edges in some places, but there's nothing affecting the core gameplay except for maybe the occasional disconnects from co-op games. The game handles those gracefully (you can finish whatever you were doing), so it's really only a minor annoyance for me.CAPCOM promised fixes for most issues and improved graphics (settings) for the PC version, but they're not out yet.The core gameplay feels polished and it's definitely a monster hunter game.

Scott	Recommended	50.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kadrin/	Having sunk hundreds of hours into this game alone on the PS4 and now starting over on the PC I have a few things to say about itPC Version- Teething problems, give them time to iron them out, most of the bad reviews on here are from snowflakes that can't run the game at capped FPS with SLI machines, it currently has issues with SLI machines among other issues in general. I'm running it at capped FPS with a mere 1600x overclocked to 4.4ghz/GTX 1070 overclocked slightly/16GB DDR4 3200 ram.Once they iron out the bugs, none of the reviews on here knocking it for performance will have any relevance.Apart from the teething problems the game is just as great as it was on the PS4.
Sasori_Senpai	Recommended	112.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sasori_jap/	All of you giving this game a negative review just for one or two problems are pathetic manchildren.Compared to the PS4 version I played for 360 hours, it has:10-30X faster load timesA higher framerate at a higher resolutionThe ability to use the keyboard and mouse or controllerSteam friend integrationFree multiplayerEase of multitasking (tabbing over to a browser to check reddit etc)By all accunts the PC version is already the superior version.Yes the mouse could have been implemented better.Yes the performance could have been betterYes the servers are having a hissyfit right nowHowever, I feel just fine playing with a controllerAlso I can turn down a bunch of settings and run at 100+ FPS just fine on a 970And lets be completely ♥♥♥♥ing honest here. Not only did MHW have server issues at the launch of the console version, but I doubt that a single person will deny that a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of PC games had server issues at their launch as well.Are there issues to be worked on and fixed? Yes.But is it a complete writeoff of a port that's not worth playing? Not even close.
Loli Fondler	Not Recommended	89.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036997440/	Horrendous console port, with terrible UI navigation and UI animations. The game absolutely does not respect the players time with unskippable cutscenes, long animations for tasks you will have to do again and again.Being forced to sit for 60 seconds after a capture and do literally nothing, or worse yet being forced to stare at the failure screen and then the LITERALLY EMPTY REWARDS SCREEN before you regain control of what you’re doing.This game could be 9/10, it has amazing moments but the frustrations to get to them makes it a struggle not worth the effort. I haven’t even mentioned the grind, which this series is famous/notorious for. It would be more bearable if there was a simple “retry” button after a mission fail. Faints being shared encourages solo play, Stats/skills that shouldn’t exist, such as “earplugs” and slide affinity, it feels like they ran out of ideas so they made things that shouldn’t affect gameplay become annoyances that you have to gimp yourself to mitigate.This game shouldn’t have been ported to PC in this state.

Unn4m3d (♥AUT♥)	Recommended	111.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrbarcode/	I wasnt sure what to give this game. It had terrible connectivity issues at first, and even as I write the review there are still problems with finding players.That being said: when you find a game, or you play with friends, it seems pretty much stable at this point, which in my eyes is a big improvement already.Now to the game at hand: I personally love it. I have never played a Monster Hunter game except for the very first one, on the PS2 I think it was, so Im not really what you would call a veteran. It is rather confusing at first, since the game throws tons of tutorials in your face (and that keeps going until you finish the story), but if you bite through it, its alot of fun.The monsters are great, they have interesting designs, and they vary greatly. You have a choice of 14 different weapons, which is alot to choose from, but you have a little training area in which you can test every one to see which one suits your playstyle.To make this short: its a game where you have to grind alot, but if you aren't totally against that it has a lot of potential, since fighting all the different Monsters is just plain fun.What I want to add is that (in my opinion) you should probably get a controller for this game, it IS playable with keyboard and mouse, but some weapons are really annoying with it, especially Ranged weapons.All in all, I do recommend it though.

ScorpionGod	Recommended	114.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkorpionGod/	Never thought I'd play this type of game before watching PS4 version gameplay on YouTube. I pre-ordered the PC version a week or 2 before the actual launch. Funny thing is, MHW PC was my first game on Steam, first game I ever pre-ordered and first game I played on Steam.My experience is so far AWESOME. Even though this is my first ever Monster Hunter game, I was able to quickly catch up with most basic and repetitious stuffs. I played fine all alone till Anjanath came out of nowhere to faint me twice and that's the moment I tried playing online.Connection wasn't stable in the early days and today I rarely see any issues in online play. I love this game and that must be why I was doing late nights ever since August 9th slaying monsters. Playing solo is hard for monsters after Anjanath the first time, but once you catch up with their pattern, it's not a big deal. You can ENJOY a lot when you play online with friends and random people. I mean when you slay big monsters in just 2-3 mins, that's amazing and fast.When you use Dual Blades, it becomes SO FAST!!BTW, one thing I dislike is the font used in options. When you compare that with other games, you feel something is missing. ;)

RoyalCE	Recommended	87.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SsGam3r/	TL;DR At BottomI was never really able to get into the older Monster Hunters back then. They were way too slow for action games in my taste and required lots of patience and online research for something as simple as an effin helmet. However, World's design heavily improves it in a way that it gives people who played the old games and were dissatisfied a much more enjoyable experience, veteran players a new way to play, and also reels in people who are completely new to the series. It's seriously awesome how much World has managed to improve the formula in a way that doesn't turn it into a totally different game. Features like wish listing to keep track of what materials you need for items, side features that allow you to gain items without having to grind monsters as much, etc, it's freakin' great. Even then, grinding monsters is fun. And I never thought a grindy JRPG could be fun. I especially love how you can determine your own combat pace by selecting different weapons. Wanna have a fast paced offensive style? Try Dual Blades. More of a slower paced defensive player? Try out the Lances and Great Swords. The effect of player choice is absolutely phenomenal. Though however not everything is perfect with the game. Optimization is wonky and even with a high end PC with an i7 and GTX 1060 6GB, I've had some frame rate drops, especially during intense action moments. Thankfully, there's no slideshows, the lowest I've dropped is 30 FPS. It's still playable mind you, but I prefer 60. I would especially love to play it uncapped but doing that kinda ♥♥♥♥s the performance. However it's easily fixed by drivers and using Geforce Experience to tune the game to good settings. Optimization is no easy thing, I get that. Especially for Japanese developers who work in a country more attuned to consoles since most PCs are potatoes. But if you were going to delay the release of the game, I'd expect some extra effort. Thankfully, patches have been coming out and will keep coming out so it's not like this game's problems will remain forever. One such problem fixed has been the network connectivity (as of 9/12/2018). I am now getting way less network errors than at launch, but it still can pop up from time to time. Moving past these problems though, it's an excellent game. Just be sure to not attempt to run this with a toaster and you'll be good. If all else fails, you can look at the modding scene that's been going on to fix the game's problems. Side note before the TL;DR: I find some of y'all absolutely pathetic to give this a game a negative rating because "muh casualization". Monster Hunter was a niche game that required weaponized autism to fully enjoy because it was a slog fest. Not everyone enjoyed or wanted to play the old titles, but with the changes this game makes it becomes available to a wider audience and thus increasing of player base. Speaking of playerbase, blaming the game for a low playerbase is absolutely moronic. It's the fault of the players deciding when to play, on what session to play, and how they set up their session (public vs private) not the game's for "not having too many players". Believe it or not, some people don't like playing with randoms. TL;DRIt's a great game, but could require some more optimization work and other improvements via patching. Though, that IS happening so...moot point. Autists need to chill about casuals/newcomers to Monster Hunter via this game. And it's not too easy. Not at all.  
HangInThere	Recommended	116.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106974750/	Overall a stunning game that brings in the feeling of nostalgia from back when i was younger. But the problem arises when i try to connect and play with my friends. We seem to get disconnected in the middle of the hunt. Is this a problem for other players as well?
Valkrie	Recommended	131.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeckingValkrie/	Use a controller.Those are three words I can well and truly suggest to you. I've played the monster hunter games since monster hunter 4 ultimate and might I just say if you ever wanted to get into the monster hunter (MH) franchise, this is the perfect game for it. They've added a variety of little details  and quality of life changes since the DS games that make the game so easy to pick up- even the interface and overall "starting" parts are user and newbie friendly.Gameplay wise, it's quite grindy- infact no, it's VERY grindy. There's quite a bit of repetitive gameplay when it comes to fighting monsters... as much as this can be seen as a con, this is very much a pro for the franchise. The main premise is to understand a monster's attack patterns and the more you play the game and fight said monster the better and more experienced you get! It's very satisfying to fight a monster that utterly destroys you one time only to fight it again and beat it with multiple "predictions" on attacks. As well as that, there are 14 different weapon types with a variety of different playstyles, such as the ranged weapons of bow and bowguns , the fast attackers like dual blads and sword 'n' shield and even the heavy hitters like hammer and great sword. In a game like this, there truly is no "best weapon" you simply pick one (or few) of the weapons you really do enjoy playing and kick♥♥♥♥♥with it. (Or get creamed,)I've played the ps4 version of the game also, I was excited to see what the mouse controls were like for the game only to be disappointed- they were extremely clunky and awkward... maybe it was my pc or the game, who knows? My friend also had the same problem; we both eventually decided to go  to using our controllers to play the game as it seemed to run much smoother and less complicated that way.Overall, it's just a fantastic game to play- an even better game to play with friends as it can have many moments that can lead to just a bunch of laughs even when you'd least expect it!
Aspersio	Recommended	128.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/g0g3t4/	Man was it the wait for a Monster Hunter game to finally be on PC (excluding overseas Frontier and Monster Hunter Online). This game definitely has the scalability for a variety of specs to have the game look like a 3DS, to insane levels of supersampling to cripple the best of hardware. The game is essentially series of boss fights among a variety of different monsters using large weapons and tools for up to 4 players in a quest. After fighting smaller monsters, gather their parts and create equipment from them to fight even bigger beasts to make better gear. It's a great gameplay loop for a game with very in-depth combat.The game's got some network problems of random disconnects however. The main story quests have such an unintuitive way to play in a co-op with a friend as all players need to start their quest alone and only after watching all the cutscenes are people able to join, or re-host for party play. It's almost better to avoid co-op play for the main story, and begin playing with others once that is done.The mouse has some unusual acceleration tied to it and no way to change to a raw input. Controllers are recommended as the game was originally a console release earlier this year.Overall the game is great and the hope is that Capcom will update and improve the port as opposed to other japanese developers that release a PC port and never patch the bugs or problems.
Cageymaru	Recommended	83.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/76561197978381846/	First of all let me state that the game has connection issues with the Steam servers.  That is not a good issue to have in a multiplayer title.  Now with that out of the way, this game is FUN!  Absolutely a hoot to run around jumping on monster's backs and chopping them to death!  The "busy" work in the game is fun also as I like collecting stuff in the game world.  Honestly I can't recommend this game more, but remember the connection issues.As far as multiplayer goes, the story mode really should allow 2 players to complete the quests together.  That's unacceptable.  Capcom should rethink that decision.  I have had zero performance issues running the game on my AMD Ryzen 1700 and Vega 64 setup.  Now Capcom really needs to figure out the server issues to make this game great!

Sephon	Recommended	113.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000135680/	It's Monster Hunter.You kill big bad monsters with complex movement patterns and behaviours with one of the 14 weapons which also have complex and deep combos, techniques and abilities.There's many layers to the combat too, you can choose to be sneaky and try and trick your target into traps or trick it to eat poisoned/drugged meats, or simple get the target into another monsters area to initate a turf war to help you with the hunt.It's an amazing game that accomodates you no matter which pacing you have, play it slow and sure or fast and loose and the game will award both playstyles to a degree.The servers suck and even 1 week later there's hardly and difference, there's mouse smoothing/acceleration that makes KB+M not as fun as it could be, there are rumors that a few textures aren't loading the hi-res versions of themselves so we're stuck with the low-res. Hopefully that'll be fixed, but that doesn't make it a bad game, just some early issues that NEEDS to be ironed out.

Sir Gregor	Recommended	285.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004359678/	Such a shame that server issue gave this such a mixed reception. While they are annoying, the game itself is on another level of impressive.It's detailed to lengths I've never seen in a video game before. Probably the most fun I've had with a game in years. There is so much to do, so much to strive for, so many specific things to consider. There is no best armour, best weapon. It's situational, you adapt, and so do your foes.The monsters think and react to you, there's plenty of equipment and strategy. A massive amount of unique and fun monsters are available to you. Dozens of weapons to choose from, all offering new playstyles.Incredible game. Steller development, graphics are stunning, animations are brilliant, story is great, gameplay is just totally up my alley.Love it. Apart from the shoddy servers I love it.
Piellar	Recommended	184.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993397536/	A game you can truely take at your own pace, it's quite welcoming to new players to the franchise like me, offering written and video tutorials for every feature, weapon and special item. I love that there's many play modes, including one that allows you to hang out indefinitely in one area with no timer, for exploring and gathering leisurely until you're jumped by some flame-breathing monstrosity. The combat system in this game is nothing short of amazing, incredible care has been put in tuning each of the 14 weapon classes, consumables are easy to manage but essential to succeed, and you will spend much time at the forge pondering what gear pieces would fit your playstyle most.Co-op multiplayer works very well at the time of this writing, if imperfect for friends who want to play the main storyline with each other, being separated for a few minutes every time because of cutscenes. Graphically very impressive, I have nothing to say against Monster Hunter: World's high level of polish and general lack of bugs. The 75$ price tag may seem intimidating, but make no mistake that this is a triple-A game well worth that, and it will keep you fuming, crying for help and jubilating for countless hours.

ToxicKnief	Recommended	110.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ToxicKnief/	Amazing game.

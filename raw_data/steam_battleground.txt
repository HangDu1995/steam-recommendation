Spliff	Not Recommended	283.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198105069452/	PUBG is what you get when amateur developers have a good idea for what could be a great game, with a small budget to start with. Now that they've made many millions (close to a billion on PC sales alone) all they see is money. They no longer care about player experience. Why spend money to make the game better when most of the people that would buy the game have already bought it? Mistakes / poor decisions: - First mistake was the game engine that they built the game on. It wasn't designed for 100 players, so they had to reduce the server tickrate to ridiculously low rates. There are better engines that can handle 100 players, but I guess they went with the cheaper solution.- Client side hit detection. This is why you can still get shot after you get into cover. Players with high ping have a big advantage over players with low ping.- No region lock or ping lock. They talked about implementing this months ago, but now you're racist or "xenophobic" toward Chinese people if you want this feature. Setting a max ping or locking players to their region would reduce the poor experience of having client side hit detection.- Lootboxes. Everything about them. Some items like the school girl outfit sell for over $1k on the marketplace. Huge incentive for cheaters, since you get points for kills and wins to buy these loot boxes with. They also just came out with locked lootboxes, so you play to get your points to get the rewards, and then you have to pay $3 to open the box or sell the box for around 25 cents (current price on the marketplace).- Not really banning cheaters. Most cheaters sell all the items they get from their lootboxes, Bluehole gets a cut of every sale. Then they ban the cheater but allow them to just buy the game again to keep playing/cheating/selling, and the cycle continues. Bluehole makes money every step of the way, so why would they change this? They make way more money from a cheater than they do from a regular player.- STEREO sound... what year is this??- Some "minor" issues with game design that could be easily fixed, like making bullets come from your gun instead of your chest, slowing the circles down a bit, etc. But compared to the above points, these are pretty minor. What would make this game better? - Engine that can handle 100 players with a decent tickrate.- Server side hit detection (only works well with a good server tickrate).- Actually ban cheaters (IP, MAC address, etc.). I know there are ways around it, but it's not as easy as just buying another copy of the game.- Sell rare items, like the schoolgirl uniform for example. Lots of people like being able to sell/trade things on the marketplace, so keep that if you must, but if Bluehole sold items themselves (even just the rare items), it would control the prices and make cheating less lucrative. If they sold the schoolgirl outfit for like $50, they would make millions. Win-win for everyone.If they had their own store for selling cosmetic items, they would have a steady income stream from people that own the game, and they wouldn't care as much about the steady income from banning cheaters and having them buy the game again. It would also give them incentive to improve the game to keep people playing and buying stuff.- Bluehole can take these Desperado crates and shove them up their♥♥♥♥♥ I will never buy a key to open one, and I won't sell them on the marketplace so that they can make more money. Using points I earned to get a crate that I have to pay to open is not a reward, greedy♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- Region / Ping lock. There are servers in every major region, why do people need to play on a server that's on the other side of the world? If the game had server side hit detection, having a higher ping would be a disadvantage so it wouldn't be as big of an issue. - Surround sound. Good positional audio is important in any FPS.If they made these changes, I would recommend this game... but we're more likely to see a better studio make a better game before any of this happens. Why is it so popular then? It's exciting, really gets the adrenaline pumping. You start with nothing and there's no respawn, so everything you do matters, and every decision you make can win or lose the round for you - where to drop, what to loot, how long to spend looting, where to go, when to go there, when to fight, when to flee, etc. Randomness of loot and circles makes those decisions and each round a little different. Option to go solo, duo, or squads, each mode changing the way you play the game.All of this makes for a fun and addicting game.. until you die to a cheater, or someone with high ping killing you after you get into cover (or they came around the corner and saw you before you could see them), or not being able to hit the guy outside your building because your bullets are coming out of your chest and hitting the window-sill, etc.The most frustrating thing about all that, is that Bluehole is not doing enough to fix it. The only punishment for cheaters is having to buy another copy of the game, how greedy can you get? They don't want to region/ping lock because they don't want to offend the Chinese, and they make a lot of money from them, especially since a large majority of the cheaters are from China. That's not racism, that's fact.There are several Chinese players in every round on NA servers, many of them are cheaters, some of them are just there to get away from the asian servers that are full of cheaters, but they still have an advantage due to their high ping. 0.05% of them are there to play with their friends in NA, and that's the main reason Bluehole said they don't want to region/ping lock. In squads and duo's where communication is very important, it really sucks to get teamed up with someone that can only speak enough english to say "China numba wun".Greed and incompetence ruined what could have been an awesome game. This just seems to be a very short-sighted money grab, when it could easily be a long term revenue stream. Edited to add:  To those that say "engine can handle 100 players look at fortnite", the tickrate (server update frequency) is still far lower than optimal in both games. Games like BF1, CS:GO, COD, etc, run server tickrates of 60Hz or higher. H1Z1 on the Forgelight engine (made for a larger number of players) runs a server tickrate of 76Hz. Tickrate isn't everything, but it's a big part of the network delay between two players, and low tickrates can cause other issues.PUBG is actually up to 30Hz now, but not until over half the people are dead. Fortnite maxes out at 20Hz when there are less than 50 players. Both games start at around 8-10Hz with everyone alive, and that increases as players die, which shows the engine can't properly handle 100 players in either game. Fortnite has better devs, same company that made the game also built the engine, so yes they are better at making it work. That doesn't change the fact that the tickrate is reduced until there are 50 players or less left alive. If it could "easily handle 100 players" the tickrate would run at the set 20Hz with 100 people alive.Recent tests: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiYX9ik0iec Netcode 101: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiHP0N-jMx8

Boltwire	Not Recommended	399.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053268485/	I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.That was until the official release of 1.0Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?: In game purchases.It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:Pros:- Fast queue times due to high player-base,- SOLID graphics.- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)Cons:- Fully released game some of the problems that should have been fixed before the release.EDIT:- PLENTY OF CHEATERS. Even though the developers started to take action against hackers now that the game has headed to ruin, there are still PLENTY of non-conventional cheaters such as VPN abusers (lifting ping on purpose to abuse the poor netcode and hit detection) and Macro users (Auto-aim/Recoil control). Even though the numbers have dropped, this is still heavily affecting the game and user experience.- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.- EDIT: Since one of the recent patches, my character no longer stutters while running, proving my point this was indeed caused by the game, and not by my PC or internet connection.- I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.################Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it.

This...IS...BACON!	Not Recommended	433.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035059977/	It starts off incredibly fun at first, and will give you an insane rush in your first few matches. Winning your first match is a feeling that few things can compare too. But I'm going to tell you now, once the honeymoon phase wears off, this game QUICKLY stops being fun and you'll begin to notice just how awful the quality of it is.- The netcode in this game is absolutely atrocious, and is hugely abusable for players with a high ping. The extremely low tickrate and insane desync that results from it means that you're constantly dying around corners a full second after taking cover - or worse, dumping half a magazine of full-auto assault rifle into someone as soon as they come around a corner, only to get onetapped by them mid-spray because they'd already come around the corner and shot you dead on their end two seconds ago, before you even saw them start moving on your end. No ping cap or region lock means players can queue for matches on servers halfway across the world and instantly get an insane amount of peeker's advantage.- There's a huge cheater population in the game that has been there ever since PUBG started getting popular. Aimbot, wallhacks, recoil scripts, teaming in solo matches, the list goes on. Battleeye does next to nothing to stop this.- There are still bugs galore that need to be fixed, some of which have been in the game since alpha. Randomly dying from fall damage just because you brushed up against the wrong wall/object, vehicles glitching into walls or flying into the stratosphere from the slightest collision (admittedly hilarious but still in need of fixing), hit registration being complete garbage - there's just too many to list here. But in their infinite wisdom, Bluehole decided to let all this go through to the 1.0 release instead of actually making the game a release-ready product, likely for Christmas sales.TL;DR: Don't get this game until it's actually in a release-ready state, if it ever gets there.

Hell no...Adding greedy microtransactions that provide no real value? Yes!Wrongly suing the competition? Hell yes!Porting the game to console in a hillariously broken state for more money? ♥♥♥♥ yeah!----------But that doesn't mean the game has zero good about. I'll just lay most of the stuff down here in a pro and con style:+ Engaging battle royale mode+ Incredibly fun with friends+ 3 large scale maps+ A variety of guns and customization+ Semi-weekly updates, though most of them aren't really anything significant- Wonky movement, especially jumping (vaulting is a great addition however)- Optimization issues, even on some high-spec setups- Server issues, desync and rubberbanding- Lootboxes (most can only be opened by buying a key)- Inferior Event Pass design to other games- Ignorant Map Playlist design- High amounts of cheater reports. I admit that i myself have never faced an actual cheater, but others aren't fortunate as me.- The devs simply not having a clue of what they're doing. (Suing the competition, ... adding new content instead of fixing the current game, porting the game to console in a broken state for that sweet microsoft money, ...)---------Conclusion: The game has massive red flags, but when it works, it works really well. Hell, even I still play it, but I wouldn't necesseraly "recommend" it to anyone new to the game, not right now.

More and more hackers and cheaters, worse and worse optimization, frequent game crashes and connectivitiy issues, these are things BlueHole should be dealing with instead of pursuing lawsuits against other companies.I felt a little disgusted when the new crates require the steam purchase of keys. However I still thought it was a good way to support their DEV team so that they could solve the gaming problems at that time. Now the problems are still there and are even worse, and it certainly shows the motive of the company is not to improve the gameplay experience but to milk every penny as fast as possible.We used to have a lot of fun in this game, and I am really appreciated that I made serveral good friends on PUBG. But now it is time for me to sell all my ingame staff and uninstall the game.If you are new to this game, I am not recommending it.

Dr. Rockso The Rock n Roll Clown	Not Recommended	839.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DiscoMagicJesus/	You can see by my playtime that I'm not just some purchase-regretting ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that didn't realize until 2 hours in just what kind of game they purchased. I've been playing for well over a year, only not as frequently lately, and it is because of my last few months of experience with this game that I can no longer recommend it to people.This game started off great. There was so much promise in its concept and execution. You could almost feel what the game should eventually be even waaaay back in its early state, back when it was so broken that a stun grenade in a busy portion of the map like School would spell disaster for several teams by promptly crashing their games with no capability to return to the match. And yet, even with absolutely infuriating scenarios like that, I am finding myself looking more fondly upon those memories than I do towards the game in its current state. And it's not from lack of improvement. Such game breaking bugs like that have been removed, and the core gameplay is leaps and bounds more smooth, intuitive, and reliable. However, there are still massive faults.I am an average player. I have won many, many chickens between solo, duos, 2-man, 3-man, and full squad. But I died/lost 4/5 games I played, a figure which has increased dramatically as of late. I haven't won a game in weeks, nay, quite possibly over a month. And it hasn't been from lack of trying, and certainly not from good teammates. Is it balance changes? It can't be. SMG's, DMR's, and the AK currently reign supreme, my favorite and most used weapons in the game. They shoot better, tighter, and more naturally. Aiming feels great. The new attachments and scopes are great. All of the map changes are great. Every improvement they have made has been great.So what is it? What is my problem with this game?As of 6 months ago, this game was a cesspool of Chinese cheaters, leaving most matches in a state of absolute chaos and dismay as you get to the final several people alive only to be instantly headshotted by some cuck with an aimbot that couldn't possibly have had a bead on you from 150m out with an (at the time) incredibly underpowered Vector. And while the volume of this has subsided, it still ♥♥♥♥ing happens. What's worse is that it is no longer just foreign influence to blame. There are plenty of English speaking cheaters as well. And what makes matters worse is that the death cam and spectator views in the game are so broken that in many instances it's hard to tell if someone isn't cheating because more often than not, the perspective you end up seeing shows wild shots into the distance, inhuman camera snaps, and impossibly compensated recoil that leave you itching to hit that report button. Are people really this good? Was 6 months all it took for people to get really, really good at this game even after it had already sold 20+ million copies? I often tend to think not, and as such, any and all suspicious deaths now get a gracious report regardless of what I see in the death cam. And honestly, that's not ♥♥♥♥ing cool.But to blame cheaters for all of this games shortcomings isn't fair, because that isn't every game. Sometimes you do just get outplayed or royally screwed by RNG or core gameplay mechanics. And I think that's where the true fault is in this game. Now that a lot of bugs have been removed and the core gameplay has been overall tightened, it's beginning to show that the base game is just...not that good. Yes, weapons are balanced, movement and interaction are much better than they used to be (though sometimes still infuriatingly clunky and unresponsive at the beginning of the game), but to call the game itself balanced is rubbish. Either you get lucky and nobody drops near you, giving you a chance to actually find gear, or you don't and you die instantly, leaving your team at a disadvantage and more often than not resulting in an immediate return to the lobby as no single member of the party wants to spectate for the next 20 minutes. This simple aspect of the game is both rewarding when you make it through, and anger inducing when you don't, cursing RNGesus to hell as you slam your left mouse button with so much hatred over that "Exit to Lobby" UI element.But that is only one source of frustration. The other is how the game handles characters being behind cover. This is I think the most important complaint any player could make about this game. I have in the several hundred gigs of replays and game captures so many instances of deaths where I am shot by someone hiding behind a tree or rock or building, where only the teeniest, tiniest part of their head is exposed from the cover, yet somehow according to the game mechanics, their gun is also able to fire around that cover and complete a shot. Yet it seems when I try to do this same action, I feel completely exposed. No matter how much I lean into and creep around a corner, it's as though my entire body is exposed, and I am more often than not targeted and shot within milliseconds of bringing my gun up to aim and tapping the peek controls. For a game that while obviously isn't rooted purely in realism but still tries its hardest to bring a sense of reality into player interaction, instances like this absolutely confuse me.Another current aggrivation includes hit detection and the application of armor values. I played a game a couple nights ago where a player in a ghillie suit was creeping his way into the circle while my squadmates and I began popping shots at him. I hit him 3 solid times with a Mini 14 from ~ 150m out. Blood on each shot, absolutely unmistakable hits right to center mass. Another teammate scored another 2 shots on him with a SCAR-L, and another teammate with an SKS delivered the killing blow with 2 well placed headshots. Upon making my way over to him, I noticed something incredibly strange. His body contained a fresh, untouched and undamaged level 3 helmet, as well as a level 3 vest that still had a whopping 173 armor value left on it. We even compared game replay footage afterwards to confirm our blood splatters, all of which according to our games showed a total of 7 confirmed hits with fully outfitted, high damage weapons. How is this possible? What about the headshots that killed him, that actually confirmed in the kill feed that he was killed with a HEADSHOT? How does this translate to no damage being taken to the level 3 helmet?This is not the first instance of this I have seen either. Since the latest balance changes, body armor appears to have become...broken. At times, you'll feel as though your level 3 vest does absolutely nothing when you get hit in the chest from 300m away with an M24 and your vest is destroyed in a single hit. And yet other times you'll find yourself hitting someone repeatedly with a similar sniper/DMR, only to see that shiny glint of a green level 1 helmet or the washed out blue of the level 1 police vest still intact and on their body.I'd like to believe I'm just crazy. I'd like to believe I just suck. But then I play a game or two where things just work out and I wipe a team, maybe even two by myself. And while I would love for those moments to redeem this game, to make me go "Wow that was so worth the pain and anguish of the last 11 games filled with absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t", it isn't. Not anymore. Because even those games were you find yourself wiping squad after squad, you still get to the final couple circles only to be met with a fate that often feels engineered to put you at odds with someone who just happened to get lucky in one way or another. It is this inconsistency that makes this game feel like a waste of time.Winning is no longer a reward of skill, it's a byproduct of luck and inconsistent game mechanics. More often than not, you'll find yourself feeling like you've simply wasted your time playing this. Sorry PUBG, but you've lost my love, and it's time for us to see new people.

Rezonate_Apex	Not Recommended	126.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RezonateApex/	We have supported this game since early access. PUBG has made over $730 million dollars. Yet, it's still not optimized, cheaters are rampant, crates are locked behind keys. Even after charging $30 for the game, they now introduce this $9.99 Event Pass.They promised us no DLC but while the maps are free, missions, rewards and progression will come at a cost. They ask for feedback but get upset that we're not singing their praises. If this were free to play, none of us would care. It's just a shame. A damn, stupid shame.This whole thing is a tone deaf slap in the face to all of us who have supported the game since launch. /u/Ford117It's hard to pay attention to PUBG anymore. As a day one player I loved the game, got my $30 worth but clearly they have lost their edge.Progress is so painfully slow that the game is just stale, and huge optimization issues STILL exist. This is why the player base is evaporating. If you dont mind the devs being gready and being completey out of toutch with the community, and removing features go ahead and buy PUBG. In my eyes there is so much better avalable.

Instead, this multi-million dollar, 1 year+ old cultural phenomenon is more broken than a browser-based flash shooter from the early 2000s. Unreliable servers, atrocious communication from the developers, an uninformed attitude by Player Unknown himself, the worst in-game purchases I have ever encountered in a game, an engine so unoptimized it can't be played on reasonably on the best hardware available, and a development timeline that has somehow made the game run even WORSE over time.I've played this game for over 450 hours and since mid-2017.

Raziel	Not Recommended	354.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bratprince/	I was PERMANENTLY banned two days back and when I appealed to bluehole support from their website, they didn't once reply to me.  (edit they did reply after about 4 days and said I was doing something wrong. I asked them many times what I did and when but they just reply with copy/paste replies and won't even tell me on what date I cheated or whatever else I did)The funny thing is that my ban came within 12 or 24 hours of PUBG's anti-cheat system randomly handing out PERMA bans to 1000's of innocent players unfairly (they acknowledged they wrongly banned people on twitter and many of those bans were reversed) but still they are considering my ban to be accurate or are ignoring it.Now, if I was a Streamer or a Famous youtuber, they would have scurried to immediately unban me but because I am some random nobody to them... I can go to hell, that's their attitude.The other funny thing is my k/d ratio and win ratio, (very low k/d ratio and not a single win in all my playtime) If I was really cheating, I would win a few times with their help at least right??It's possible that I am banned because I accidentally killed a streamer/youtuber and he looked at their stupid death cam and decided I was cheating and THAT could be the real reason I have been banned. OH MAN This game should burn in hell.OH, AND THEY DIDNT JUST BAN ME BUT HAVE POSTED A PERMANENT GAME BAN ON MY ACCOUNT. SO ANY TIME I NOW PLAY AN ONLINE GAME ON STEAM, I WILL BE SUSPECTED OF CHEATING ALL BECUASE THEY CAN ONLY TARGET INNOCENTS AND NOT ACTUAL CHEATERS AND HACKERS.And don't think this won't happen to you. Their anti-cheat has randomly PERMA banned people in waves many times (and they haven't been reversed) so if you buy this game, it could happen to you as well and if your not some streamer with clout, you can just ♥♥♥♥♥ on the forums about it where the extremely toxic steam community won't believe you and just mock you for cheating.As for the game itself, it was still kind of buggy when I was playing a few days ago which makes you wonder what they have been doing with the massive sums of money they made with this game and why are they doing event passes which are a ripoff and adding crates and overpriced microtransactions instead of improving the game further and adding new content like new modes and a ♥♥♥♥ing shooting range for ♥♥♥♥s sake!!! (Edit: This just in.. Shroud teams up live on stream with a professional cheater (meaning he even sells cheat software for PUBG) and gets a measly 30-day ban ... nice one BUMhole!! ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9PmCmOTcaM its the second story at about 1:25 ) If they had discovered a 'commoner' player like me doing the same thing, it would have been a life ban for sure!!!)

Pedro-NF | NoobsForever.net	Not Recommended	567.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_sacred_emperor/	(CHECK OUT THE UPDATES AT THE BOTTOM)It's an amazing game with a lot of potential, but I simply cannot recommend it until the publisher stops babysitting streamers and stops banning people who kill or disturb them. I don't watch or follow streamers and can't see the point in doing that instead of actually playing the game. This is a matter of principle - if you'the consequences of doing that. And while the streamers get pampered, cheating is completely out of control.What worries me the most is that Brendan Greene (aka PLAYERUNKNOWN) seems to be a fan of Microsoft and their "software as a service" business model, which already spawned abominations like Cancer 10[www.grc.com]. Thus the lack of plans for Linux and Mac OS X ports and for Vulkan support. I'm pretty sure they have DirectX 12 support planned though and eventually the game might become Cancer 10[www.grc.com] only, which would be a real shame.UPDATE 1: with the 14 September 2017 update, the devs decided to go all Microsoft and removed some of the players' choices. The Shadows setting is now being ignored, and a high level of shadows is being forced on all players, together with ambient occlusion, bloom and depth of field. All the bugs reported on the game's official forums[forums.playbattlegrounds.com] by people who played on the test servers before the update was deployed to the main servers were solemnly ignored, making me wonder what's the point in having test servers at all.UPDATE 2: one of their "community managers" posted an "explanation" referring to this topic[forums.playbattlegrounds.com] on reddit instead of on their official forums where the topic was created, so I posted on their official forums that doing that was amateurish of him. A few minutes later, I was summarily banned from their official forums without any previous warning by a moderator going by the nick PUBG_Caesar of Roma. And to think that I've been helping to promote this game on all the [>NF<] Game Servers[www.noobsforever.net] sites and community channels since it was launched...So, when you post on the PUBG official forums, be extremely careful not to write anything the hypersensitive, touchy-feely "community managers" and moderators might find even slightly offensive to them, or you will be banned without warning and with no chance to appeal the ban.UPDATE 3: on 20 December 2017 the game officially left early access state, and I gotta give the devs some credit for having had the courage to release this... thing. They actually managed to make the game look and play and sound worse than the early access version. All textures have been downfiltered and the color palette reduced. Chromatic aberration also seems to have been applied, together with color oversaturation. I would say that, once they admitted to themselves that they were unable to increase the game's performance, they decided to partially achieve that by downgrading the quality of the graphics. And the water... what have they done to the water?!?!? Was it really their intention to make it look like an oil spillage happened?Now on to the new "desert" map (AKA Miramar). It's hard to find words to describe that abomination. While every spot on Erangel had some kind of "point" to it, with different strategies needed depending on where you decided to land, the new map would probably have been better if they had let a program generate it by randomly placing groups of buildings and hills across the map - because that's what it is, a pointless mess of pointless spots, plagued by even worse graphics than Erangel, with horribly overbright low-quality textures covering the whole thing. Any FPS game from the mid 2000's looks and plays and sounds way better than this. I laughed a lot with my friends because some of the new vehicle sounds actually reminded us of someone having sexual intercourse. The bombing sounds are equally laughably inconsistent. I really tried hard to find some redeeming quality to this release but it's so bad and annoying in so many ways that I'm not even feeling like playing the game anymore.UPDATE 4: with the release of the new crates on 22 February 2018, I decided today to check out the state the game was in. I only have one word to describe it: ABOMINATION. They managed to make the graphics and the maps even uglier - even the once glorious Erangel is now hard to look at without my stomach churning. For some reason they decided to shrink the fonts and the game's items, making text harder to read and items harder to pick up. The game's items were also reskinned and look much worse now, as does most everything else. But the icing on this rotten cake is the new "sliding feature". It works like this: when you stop moving, you continue to slide in the direction you were moving for a while. That makes you miss turns, items and enemies all the time. The only reason I can possibly imagine for someone to play the game the way it is now is to get the crates and sell them on the community market.UPDATE 5 (27 May 2018): Chinese cheat fest.

However, there are two things are that holding this game back.  The streamers and the developers.  Arguably, the streamers are the ones that made this game famous but as of right now, they are ruining it with the help of the developers.  "There are two rules for success...  Number one, never reveal everything you know."The Streamer.  These are the people who cry and whine about stream sniping.  I have to be completely honest, I feel sorry for these guys...  For being complete morons.  If you're going to complain about stream snipers then whine to the developers otherwise you're not going to play their game anymore, you need to shut up and get out.  The laziness and the "♥♥♥♥ YOU, GIVE ME MONEY!" attitude from the streamers disgust me the most.  They could easily put up a delay, blur out information, and block out the map...  BUT, they choose not to.  Instead, this is where the devs come into play..."Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man's character, give him power."The Devs.  With very little to no proof at all, they will ban you outright because a streamer cried stream sniper.  In fact, the devs don't even need proof, the streamers' tears and butthurt emotions show all the proof that he's a salty loser.  You guys need to listen to the real community, the Steam reviews, the people on Reddit.  Not to the dumbasses who stream and cry "STREAM SNIPER, BAN HIM!" whenever they get salty about being killed.  At this point, there are possibly more innocent people banned than actual stream snipers.  Go for the real problems, the hackers, the exploiters, and OPTIMIZATION.  This is completely unacceptable and you guys are sucking the streamer's♥♥♥♥♥♥♥  TL;DRDEVS, you guys need to man up and tell these guys to ♥♥♥♥ off.

༺ buddhapest ༻	Not Recommended	338.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/buddhapest/	Edit 2018.03.31: yes, i played 300hrs in the game and enjoyed quite a large percentage of those.  that definitely feels like a game i should give a big thumbs up to.  but in the end, a review should reflect how you feel about a game after playing it.  i've played games for 1-2 hours and loved them and will have fond memories of years later (Timeframe) so # of hours is not a very interesting metric.i've always enjoyed milsims and PUBG really hit the sweet spot there.  i wanted this game to be where i spend my most precious resource: my time.  i think we all agree that the potential for PUBG to be the ultimate serious FPS Battle Royale was there but has been squandered because the game is so frustrating to play at high level.  with that in mind, here's the original review:it feels weird to be thumb downing such a popular game which i myself played for over 300 hours, enjoyed with friends, had some unforgettably entertaining moments in, and whose best players i watched often on twitch when unable to play myself.however, thumbs down it is and the game has been uninstalled.when i got the game in september of last year it was a hot [relatively] new thing with amazing potential and it was forgivable to have all the wonky issues (desync, start game lag, etc).  since then, the early access game has gone gold, introduced a new map, added cosmetics and taunts, changed balance in weapons, addressed cheats, etc.  the dev team has definitely been busy and adding a lot of content and interest to the game.the problem?  the foundation on which pubg is built hasn't changed.  at this point, given the focus of the dev team, this signals to me that it will likely never change.the devs attempted to fix the start of game lag by redistributing starting player locations and removing pre-game items.  to me this is a clear indication that the basic problem in the engine hasn't been addressed, just worked around.  the client to client discrepancies due to architecture decisions made early in the development process now seem unlikely to be addressed in the future.ask yourself how many times the pubg engine misrepresents player positions and angles when a kill happens.  the likelihood is that more often than not someone [typically the one on the receiving end ;)] is shaking their head and it genuinely doesn't have anything to do with their reactions to what they see in the game.as a comparison, take the decade old source engine that drives counter strike global offensive.  you can complain all you want about that game but the base it is built on is incredibly solid.  the surprises at every level of play have to do with player skill, not engine quirks.when TSM_Viss returned from IEM Katowice 2018 in march - having played PUBG only on LAN and not online for several days he had this to say: https://clips.twitch.tv/SwissCaringSowHoneyBadger:"after playing on LAN you come back to this, you guys have no idea how much lag we play with constantly in this game [...] if they could get the game feeling like how it feels on LAN, online, ho-my-god.  it would be a dream."it's 2018.2 decades since Quake World set the bar for responsiveness in online games you simply can't have an action FPS run on an engine that must allow as much unreliability as PUBG and with no signs of that ever being addressed.
1.8t	Not Recommended	293.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/1point8t/	A vision of success butchered by greed. ------------------------------------------As a life-long gamer I have learned there are two ingredients that, when applied, spell out destruction. Greed and disregarding your fanbase's concerns yields a drop in customers as well as reputation. I will write an honest, unbiased review based off of my gameplay experience and thank you for taking the time to read my review. *For the sake of the review I will include the whole entity of PUBG (head company/developers/publishers) when I mention "PUBG"*Going back a few years, I spent a good amount of time in DAYZ:SA. I really enjoyed the loot/survival aspect, but the game was being developed far too slowly and I was ready to move on. I hopped on the Battlegrounds train while it was in the beta stage and I was impressed. In the midst of a growing market of battle royale games I decided to give my time and money to PUBG because I anticipated a lot of great content. Normally I pray the rosary at the thought of "early access" games and throw holy water on pre-orders, but after reading several great reviews I wanted to see what the hype was about. From conception to release, the game seemed to grow exponentially and everything was going great. They even had 2 crates, Suvivor and Wanderer, that you didn't need a case key to open. Was this CD PROJEKT RED manifesting in a different form? Everything was going well until the introduction of paid crates. The core things I like about PUBG at this moment in time are:*Diversity of weapons*Diversity of attachments*Character agility (vaulting/jumping/crouching/prone/swimming)*Vehicular maneuverability*Vehicular diversity*Access to every building, making it feel immersiveThe core things I dislike about PUBG at this moment in time are:*Clientside lag*High ping players being grouped with low/moderate ping players*Paid Crates/skins*Bluehole trying to scrape as much money before the game capsizes*Useless weapons (crowbar/machete)To me, this game feels like a cash grab. Instead of fixing their netcode, separating players based off of ping, and developing a structured game, PUBG does the opposite. It caters to a younger audience that doesn't know any better about the prinicples of gambling, attempts defaming Fortnite instead of taking some ideas and implementing them in a better way, and bases the game off of an economy. Anything that is based off of economic gain, and content not in the interest of customers, on a fundamental level WILL collapse. Once the economy runs dry, so do the developers and the trend follows all the way through to the top, whereas the opposite will happen if you keep your customers happy. What's more upsetting is the "FIX PUBG" button in the menu on the top right once the game loads. It is up to the developers to create, patch, and improve a game while listening to the player. Instead I get the feeling that our concerns go in one ear and out the other while continuing to release new crates/skins/clothes.Dean Hall promised so many fans a working DAYZ:SA, but once he reached his financial goal, he ran and left the DAYZ:SA corpse to rot in someone else's hands. History repeats itself.Vote with your wallet. Do not support this game or any others that are more interested in your hard earned money than they are interested in giving you a fun, memorable experience.At the time of this review being published, I have logged 275 hours into the game.

(99% of all cheaters are chinese (this number is taken from the banned list, im not making it up, 99% of all cheaters are from china, so this creates a huge problem for none chinese players when chinese players play on none chinese servers. - People have been banned for the crime of shooting Twitch Streamers (doesn't matter if you have a twitch account watching the stream or not, just the act of shooting a streamer have gotten people perma banned from the game.- People have been banned for driving around the game honking the horns in the cars.- People have been banned for shoting people that join Squads as randoms who shot their team mates... ye that's right, shoting a teamkiller in selfdefence against other teamkillers have gotten people Permabanned from the game.- The Anti cheating "service" is more incompetent than Brendon Green.

ティアラ	Not Recommended	171.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/azusa_twin/	As much as I like this game and the whole concept of battle royale game mode is really intresting I think PUBG really did a good job of bringing out the feeling of the battle royale. Basically placing 100 players into 1 world and letting us killing each other to win either with a team of 4 or duo or solo. But then I just can't recommend this game because of its various problems and how the developers is treating the player base.First off the game itself.. Or just the whole management of the gameFirst off I will not really blame them for the server issues because handling 1 million plus players does offer some challenges etc but slapping ADS into a game to buy a third party software just to "boost" their connectivity to their game servers is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed up seriously like wow, they too paid a premium for the game but why is it that after paying for the game they still have to get a third party software to "boost" their connectivity to the game servers? isn't the devs of PUBG themselves should take the responsibility and say "Okay we need more servers for the chinese players"? Honestly I do not care about much about this whole issue because it does not affect me in any way but what if they did this to the English players or the whole player base? " Oh hey our server can't handle the amount of people so please after buying our game please get a third party "booster" software to "boost" your connection" Like what the actual ♥♥♥♥?The game trailer.. Looks really good am I right? Looks very interesting, so much intense fighting and feels thrilling. Well sadly the game trailer is just full of♥♥♥♥♥♥ The trailer is what you would call glitter over a game. Those fights you seen in the trailer out of 100 games you will probably will only ever experience those fights in like 1 out of your 100 games or totally none at all. Those fight rarely occurs because RNG ♥♥♥♥s you over or you will be running for half the game from the blue circle just to be killed be some cheater later on. To put it simply the trailer is just a cool montage to make the game look good.  [This is not really a problem it is more of me nitpicking at here] DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE GAME TRAILER.OptimizationIt is really bad. I can run the game smoothly at 60FPS but the rendering of textures in this game is just horrible. I won't even say much for this because it is just obvious when you play the game.If you are wondering what I am running with for this game. It is not the best but I am pretty surely this can run it at a much better rate- ProcessorIntel(R) Core(TM) i5-7500 CPU @ 3.40GHz-  Video CardNVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 - RAM16 GB - Operating SystemMicrosoft Windows 10 (build 15063), 64-bitThe Devs going back on their word regarding microtransactions is kind of ♥♥♥♥ed upYes I know it is only for cosmetic purposes and it will not affect the gameplay at all. [ For those people who will say "hey but its only cosmetics" ]Adding microtransactions means adding microtransactions and them going back on their word there is no other way around. It is like a lie is a lie no other way around it.So what this means? In the future anything they promise us like lets say a free new map for example. They can easily go back on their word anytime and say that the new map they promised us to be free will be sold as a DLC :D I mean why not right? They went back on their word on microtransactions and it is so blatant, this means that the Devs dare to go back on their word without fear. Oh not to mention the game is still in EARLY ACCESS filled with a alot of bugs.Oh yes early access with loot crates. Whats next? Needing to open lootcrates to get keys to open other lootcrates? Well if it really comes from this game I won't be surprised at all.And finally this takes the cakeCHEATERSIn this game it is so hard to get first place basically winning and the cheaters is getting extremely out of hand. Aside from fighting other 95 + other players you still have to deal with cheaters!! In the early stages there weren't many cheaters but after some time they grew and there seem to be nothing has been done to put a stop to them. Right now literally every game there is usually 1 cheater lurking just having extreme speed [ The most common I see so far that is obvious ] or just "aimbotting". Just goto youtube and search you can see lots of them. Here is an example where I encountered a cheater. Was in a team of 4, 1 dead and 3 was alive and 3V1. Me and 2 other friends was alive. [ Note my team was all at 80% HP ]I was downed by a burst fire from far range [ 4 shots from AKM downed me instantly ] But managed to get revived. I found it very suspicious but i doubted there was a cheater. People do hit lucky shots once in a while. But this is where things gets very obvious. Final circle came and then the opponent just killed all 3 of us in an instant and all of us were behind cover. And game over just like that. You can say oh we are just bad it is up to you to think what you want but lets be real here you will know someone is cheating when somthing so stupid happens like in my case all 3 of us dies behind cover at the same time instantly. Like if I were to die when peeking ok the opponent may be just be very skiled but no all 3 of us were behind cover.For those who still says you have not encountered cheaters, well good for you but play the game more and you will encounter them sonner or later.  Honestly I do not even know what kind of cheats that person was using but it was just plain obvious ] Just plain disappointed and disgusted at its practices in this game and how the player base is getting treated.

You can simply tell from their id. So I guess my question would be why you guys haven't banned them yet? I mean they are probably the easiest to be detected. For example, wg123456789 is a very typical id that is selling hacks. I understand that you guys don't speak Chinese but you can reach out to me or other Chinese players.

Mittens	Not Recommended	301.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KittenNamedMittens/	Originally written on Jan 30th, 2018.Sept. 29th, 2018 update: Hackers are still as present as ever, just in the last game I played I watched a single chinaman instantly headshot 8-10 people without ever aiming downsight from 200-300 meters away.The problem is still a strong mixture of the Chinese playerbase's rampant abuse of hacks and the devs doing absolutely nothing to fix the problem. Despite the "fix PUBG" campaign they have rolled out hackers are as common if not more common than ever with it being easy to find 5-6 per game by spectating after death, all of them always being Chinese.Not to mention the other downside now being the long queue times thanks to the playerbase dying due to the previous paragraph's issues. When I first wrote this review there were 3 million players daily, now there is less than a million on average. You know something is dreadfully wrong with the game when it loses 66+% of its playerbase in 8 months.Avoid this game like the plague and you will be better off.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL;DR - I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase. - TL;DRI've got quite a few hours in this game, not enough to be a no-life but enough to know how it is. Let me break some things down for you about this game.It's almost unplayable. The sheer number of cheaters (literally almost all if not all are from China) has been growing steadily for over a month. Ever since more and more Chinese players have migrated to the North American servers the  population of cheaters has skyrocketed. Allow me to list what will happen to you regularly:- You will join a lobby and all you will hear is a dozen plus voices shouting in Chinese with the occasion expletive in English. - You will drop and find supplies as normal- You will run in to a solo/group/duo/etc. as expected- Instead of banter during the firefight all you hear is shrieking and yelling in Chinese (They talk in-game A LOT for some reason)- You will be instantly shot in the head after you leave cover (often before too) by somebody who was 100 meters+ away and was not even aiming down their sights, just hip firing.- You will be angry that you were killed by a cheater- You will take a break for a few minutes- You will go back to the top of this list.Literally of the last 5 games I have played 4 of my 5 deaths have been to Chinese who were cheating on the North American servers. I will tell the story of the last death.Partner and I were on a rooftop picking up a couple items, I see two players brazenly jogging down the middle of the road, one not wearing pants (A telltale sign it is a Chinese player), and tell my partner to get ready to attack them. At this point we have not at any point crested the barrier between us, but the enemy player in front of the duo has been looking directly at my position on a roof in the middle of town the whole way down the road. I told my partner to shoot and within a half second of him standing and taking his first shot he was knocked on the ground, I had also stood up when I said to shoot and I was on the ground almost instantly after my partner. Watching the death cam revealed the instant we both stood up the same player headshot both of us, while running, while firing from the hip. Their target reticule was as large as it could possibly be, yet they managed to hit both of us in the head twice in less than a second at 50 meters while moving and not aiming. You could think it was a wildly lucky shot, but when the same scenario has happened twice before tonight alone, it isn't coincidence that all the players doing this magical shots are all Chinese and assuredly cheating. I'm not bad at the game, I have multiple wins under my belt, I know what a good player acts like, and none of the Chinese players who kill me act like that.The game is broken. Not because of in-game glitches or errors (of which there are more than a few, freezing on start is a big one) but because there are hundreds of thousands of cheaters, literally. The developers of the game have openly admitted that a vast majority of the cheating players are Chinese, but sternly refuse to region lock the game and keep the Chinese players on the Chinese servers. They claim it is "unfair" to keep the "good players" out because of "a few bad eggs" However a "few bad eggs" is the majority of over 1,500,000 banned cheaters. It is more unfair to the few Chinese players that do not cheat to be forced to play with all their cheating brethren than it is to the entirety of the EU, NA, SA, SEA, etc. communities and players, who are all burdened by the massive influx of cheaters from a single region.I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to anyone so long as the developers refuse to take any real action against the game ruining cheats that are running rampant throughout their game. If I could return the game at this point I would. I hate that I have given money to a company that cares so little about their fanbase.

INSOZ	Not Recommended	340.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986601840/	The game HAD a lot of potential last year. First some PROS:+ Still might have some potential...+ Highly competitive -> no storytelling, just get in the action (for those who want this kind of games).+ Thrilling -> reaching the finale is a quite an adrenaline boost, you have to focus in, stay sharp and vigilent.+ Quite difficult -> weapon mechanics for example: bullet drop, recoil, weapon attachments, bullet travel speed, damage etc. have to be considered and make the game harder to master thus more interesting and rewarding.Now let's get to the points which make all the PROS above irrelevant. The developers managed to turn this game into absolute garbage: - Doesn't matter what kind of PC you have: Crashes, Stutters, FPS Drops 24/7- Doesn't matter how fast your internet is: Their servers don't give a damn- Doesn't matter how good of a player you are: You die to game bugs, lags, freezes, crashes, desync ent.- Doesn't matter if developers see these comments: You get crates with fancy clothes to dress your character and patches that continue to ruin the gameplay and performance.- Doesn't matter that new maps are released: All of them are unplayable due to the horrible server performance/netcode- Doesn't matter if you actually want to play: "Servers are too busy. Please try again later."A few examples:* You land with a large group o people around that try to defeat you, you find a weapon, you can not pick up the weapon because the game lags out HARD (no matter the internet connection), you die to someone who had "server luck" on their side and actually picked up a weapon.* You try to remain stealthy and silent so people don't spot you, you die because someone followed you by seeing your bugged out weapon models randomly hanging in the air on the path you took before.* You get shot at, you see who it is and hide behind a big♥♥♥♥♥rock. You are perfectly hidden, the guy doesn't see you and shoots at the air near the rock, you die because these shots hit you. (Confirmed with death-cam)* You run into a guy, blast a shotgun right into his chest/face at close range, (blood shows confirming you hit him) but somehow he's perfectly fine, shoots you and kills you, you check the death cam - his HP remained full all the time.All examples above do not occur rarely, but daily and theres much more. Welcome to PUBG.

However I feel its important to state I have infact been unable to log into the PUBG servers for much longer than that. I believe the attention this got from the public was the main contributing factor in the reversal. played a single round after the e-mail just to see if I could.

Moonmoon	Not Recommended	142.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pandasquad/	#RegionlockChinaSeriously though, this game is one of the most fun games on the market.  It runs far better than it used to, and every patch seems to bring more and more improvements.  However, there is one glaring problem: Chinese hackers.  NA servers are INFESTED with Chinese hackers.  I never noticed the issues until recently, perhaps with the implementation of the kill cam.  My partner and I are top .5% in duos, and the game is borderline unplayable at times.  Half the time we get killed, it is by someone with a name like 'ahskf5834732843' or 'lin-feng-838912839'.  Upon review of the kill cam, they are tracking us through walls and snapping straight to where we are even when there is no possible way they knew where we were that fast! The event that caused me to write this review was someone killing us both from 400+ yards away with an iron sights AKM WITHOUT LAYING OFF THE TRIGGER.  Chinese hackers are sucking the fun out of this game.I love this game, and it really hurts to say it, but unless China is kept off NA servers, I can't recommend PUBG to anyone.
FordFordFord	Not Recommended	1,237.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StephenFord/	This game was supposed to be different. Instead, it's become exactly what we all hate. They could have taken the $730 billion dollars and put it into the game, hiring new talents to optimize it, make anti-cheat software, create addicting levels and polish the game to the point that most AAA titles could only dream. They got greedy. It doesn't matter how many hours you sink into their game, or the $30 you spent on the experience. They wanted more. They claim they need to continue making money after making nearly $1 billion dollars. So, they turned the crates you earned through game time into loot box items that were locked behind keys you had to pay for, which in turn has incentivized rampant cheating, ruining the game.Now, they're trying to sue a company that is more successful for using their one gimmick that they stole from another game. On top of that, they've added an "event pass" to rent items that will expire and introduced XP? Any criticisms from the community that wants it to do well is met with anger and hubris from the community managers. This game has truly lost it's way and no in-game experience can wash away the taste of absolute greed from a company that treats it's community simply like dollar signs.  So disappointing. Thanks for the memories PUBG but I can no longer enable the monster you've become. Good luck with the court case.

[ARX]AnthonyPS	Recommended	62.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/	IntroductionPLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (PUBG) is a battle-royale, 100-players, open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. You've struck the gold.My claim is not without reason. The following is PUBG's pros and cons in my opinion:Pros1. Extremely active and communicative developers. This is vital for an early access game. PUBG is being constantly updated every month. I would speculate that this is one of the major factors in PUBG's success. Other battle-royale PvP games are mostly in Early-Alpha for years and their devs are too focused on gathering as much money as they can from the current players without making any real development progress on the game - PUBG is exactly the opposite.2. Great gameplay concept. No pay-to-win and no grind-to-win. Apparels are only cosmetics. The only thing you keep from playing PUBG is your skill. The PvP is thrilling and definitely fun to play with your friends.3. Non-toxic community. Simply because there is no chat function. Switch your voice channel to team-only and you're good to go. I wouldn't recommend teaming up with strangers because of obvious reasons.4. Highly demanding on teamwork and strategy. You can't just hop off the plane and recklessly run around the map no-scoping bozos. You have to plan out your movement very carefully and quickly since time is of the essence. Difficult decisions comes up often, especially in squad play (e.g. risk your life to revive your mate or run like hell to safety; Kill someone and give out your position to nearby players or stay quiet; Deciding your next 'safe spot', etc.) An enjoyable learning curve definitely exists - not too steep and not too lean. 5. A shooting game that applies semi-realistic weapon recoil, bullet travel time, and bullet drop is always appreciated.6. Various vehicles, weapons, weapon mods, clothings, and equipments are scattered all over the battleground to aid you in your quest of survival. The weapon stats variety amps up the gameplay - It can be quite a challenge to engage in a firefight when you got the wrong weapon for the situation.7. Although FPS is not recommended due to limited POV, the game supports both FPS and TPS.8. Minor performance improvements can get quite noticeable after several updates. Devs truly are working on the optimization issue. We can look forward towards better performance in the future.Cons1. Currently, very performance-demanding. The game isn't optimized that well yet and runs on very unstable fps even on high-end rigs. The minimum 6 gigs of RAM is an absolute minimum - virtual RAMs can't help your 4-gigs-RAM PC. In terms of GPU, one of my friends that is using a GTX980 is suffering from <30fps and extremely slow loading progress. Another friend with a GTX1060 suffers from fps drops during rain/smoke.As a response to comments' feedback for my 1st cons list: The game is still playable on all those mentioned GPUs. I just want you to know that the game is not optimized well. FPS drops, crashes, and screen freeze will sometimes happen even on high-end rigs. It happens randomly - I don't measure the frequency.UPDATE: Although the game is still quite laggy, minor performance improvements are already noticeable after the latest updates. I no longer suffer from fps spikes with my GTX1080. Most performance issues are related to server lag instead of PC after June 27 update.2. Server is lagging badly due to high player base. I would speculate devs didn't expect a huge sale boom and didn't have the resources to support all the players. As an example, you were running to cover when under enemy fire. You already reached the cover, but 2 seconds later, blood spurts out of your chest, you fell down to the ground gasping for air as your vision starts to blur. You scream for your squadmate to magically heal your bullet wound by rubbing the grass around you, but then...okay you get my point3. Gameplay is monotonous. Similar to CSGO's Competitive and Dota 2, you only have one type of game. The unique experience relies on various encounters with the squad/enemy in-game.4. Melee weapons are terribly inaccurate. Aiming also can be a bit off sometimes. Possibly caused by the server lag.5. Controls are terribly not reactive. It takes some miliseconds for the game to recognize LMB/RMB/'Use' command. Or even failing to recognize the commands at all. It can take three, four RMBs to activate the scope. It's kind of annoying when the weapon refuses to shoot when I press LMB because of the input recognition lag. This is a vital issue for a PvP game - devs better fix this quickly.As a response to the comments' feedback: I have to add that my statement about the terrible control is a rare occasion. Generally, 1, or 2 key inputs would be recognized. I would say having to press twice is much more common than 3/4 times like I said. But it does often take some miliseconds for the inputs to be recognized. My point is still valid: The controls are NOT reactive - horrible for a PvP game.6. Vehicles flips too easily and difficult/too unrealistic to drive7. Door and movement bugs seem to be quite prevalent lately. Whenever I move a step ahead, the game throws me back 3, 4 steps backwards. Seems to be affecting the entire server whenever it happens. Invisible doors also prevent players from entering a building, throwing us outdoors whenever we try to enter a building. Similar to fps spikes, these happen randomly.ConclusionDon't lose all hopes because of my cons list - remember that this is an early access game. I know some of the cons can be too much to handle and disturbs the gameplay, but devs are very active in updating the game. I dare to conclude that PUBG is currently the best battle-royale MMOFPS/TPS PvP game out there. The current state of the game is more than playable. Definitely worth purchasing even when it's not on sale.Well that's all I have to say about PUBG. Hope it can be of help to potential buyers!P.S: I already addressed my low playtime hours issue in the comments section. Please kindly read all the older comments if you believe my playtime hours is insufficient to write a review.UPDATE: Never expected my review would go up top on Most Helpful for this game. So I've decided to not take down this review after having more playtime hours. I'll update it if there're any significant changes.UPDATE 2: This review was made before the era of the 'stream sniping' and the microtransaction drama. I haven't played the game for a while so I lack proper first-hand experience to update my review. With that said, keep in mind that this review is outdated.

CheckBanning people to protect the scummy streamer ecosystem? CheckThe gameplay is great and I couldn't praise it more but if you respect your integrity as a consumer you should NOT support developers that act against consumers' interests.PlayerUnknown himself said that there wouldn't be any microtransactions in the game to focus all resources on finishing the game as soon as possible and here came lootboxes that you have to buy keys for (with in game currency boxes on the side). He even had the balls to say that when the game launches the in-game currency loot boxes will be off the shelves and the only cosmetics you will be able to buy are the ones you have to pay for.Don't support this developer.

-[CST]- Meticulous7	Not Recommended	112.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965478715/	This game is incredibly enjoyable, exciting and gets my adrenaline rushing like nothing I've ever played....BUT, until the devs stop banning people because streamers say they were "harassed", I'm giving it a thumbs down.Devs, honking a horn is NOT harassment. Explain to me how that effects someones stream or is harassment? Kill the person if they're doing that, and if they're in your squad, don't play with that person again (DUH). Also, when you're constantly being thrown into random servers, the odds of actually "stream sniping" someone is virtually impossible. This isn't like other games where you can find the server name and follow the streamer into it. Who the hell made this decision?Also, the broken promise regarding microtransactions. That is pretty goddamn shady. That's bad enough, but when there are so many glaring areas that need work, ignoring all of that to add a feature you said you wouldn't add until release is a straight kick in the nuts to your supporters. Devs, don't forget: We made you successful, and we can undo that by choosing not to buy anymore games from someone who isn't trustworthy, and thinks prioritizing streaming to the point of BANNING legitimate players who may not even be aware the other person is streaming is INSANITY. Whoever made this decision needs to be FIRED.You guys have created a PR nightmare for yourself and until you make it right it's only going to get worse. It's like you started out with a row boat and now you're flying around in a Yacht. Except now you decided to blow a hole in the bottom of the yacht, allowing it to take on water (which will inevitably sink it), but you choose to pretend the hole isn't there and that you didn't make it. GET BACK TO REALITY.Actual hacks deserve a ban, not because someone did something that some sniveling streamer didn't like.

WillyTee	Not Recommended	1,609.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006548222/	Look, it's fun, especially with friends. It's an adrenaline junkie's game unlike any other.But all the things you could forgive in early access, are far less forgiveable now the game has launched.There are certainly a number of flaws in the game itself - the maps, the RNG loot distribution, the vaulting system's limits and bugs, the utter idiocy of its physics system at times...But ya know? They're stuff you can work past.What's really turned me off this game, however, despite putting in hundreds of hours? Poor server performance, and hackers.The former is the biggest issue, and will often make you think you're suffering at the hands of the latter, even when you're not (though you inevitably also will).The game essentially moves at the pace of the slowest, so you'll find yourself killed full seconds after making it behind cover, or lay shots into someone, only to learn they haven't registered on their end. It's a great concept, reasonable execution, but ultimately it'll just come to disappoint you as you find yourself defeated by the game and it's shortcomings, rather than your fellow players.
ThatOneFox	Not Recommended	224.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/that1fox/	I've been playing PUBG since i got a key from my favorite small time streamer back in the closed beta days, and back then i had such high hopes. After playing countless hours of H1Z1, The Culling, and Arma3 Battle Royale, i could tell that PUBG was headed in the right direction with a lot of potential. And oh how i was woefully wrong. I've played countless hours of PUBG, and over time, my excitement dwindled and i got slowly more and more fed up with all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Nowadays it's pretty difficult for me to enjoy the game at all, after all of the faith i initially put into the concept and the designers.For my experience, i tend to not pay attention to hackers, and i never got banned for false stream sniper accusations, so my opinion i'm expressing here is purely on game design and execution. However, it's worth looking into the way the devs have handled PR and hackers, but i won't go into it. My main issues are with the bland and tired game design choices that the devs keep making after their player base clearly voicing their lack of appreciation for it. Glaring issues: 1. The graphical fidelity tied to performance. Or lack thereof. Now, granted this problem has been addressed pretty well with full release, before then, the game either looked like♥♥♥♥♥or ran like♥♥♥♥♥ and there was zero inbetween. Even with full release, it still has to look pretty sub-par for our generation of systems to run as well as a battle royale shooter should.2. The gunplay. I've been pretty spoiled by Escape From Tarkov in terms of gunplay recently, but I also have too many hours across the various Arma titles, and i love my guns irl, and PUBG's gunplay is atrocious in comparison. Bullets travel at a painfully slow speed to where you have to pretend you're shooting BB guns at people leading four or five body lengths ahead someone running normal to you at 25m away.2.5 The hit registration/player-to-player sync is pretty damn bad. This also segways into point 3. but you'll watch your little tracer rounds travel through people's helmets while they're standing still and get no hint of a successful hit, or you'll light someone up 15 feet in front of you and watch them turn into a red mist and they'll turn around and drop you in one or two shots. It's all just super sloppy feeling, like you're constantly gambling with bad servers and chinese players with 500 ping.3. Horrendous servers. This is an issue that if anything has gotten worse since full release. The first 5 minutes or so of landing into the map is just rubber banding, waiting 5-15 seconds to collect things off of the ground, getting shot around corners that you turned several seconds prior, and some of the jankiest gunfights you will ever see in a $40 or whatever it costs nowadays game. You'll get shot around cover pretty consistently throughout the game, you'll watch your bullets phase through people running in a straight line, and there will be the occasional Corvo inspired blink man who can get from point A to point B by teleporting up stairs or around tight corners to instantly drop you because the servers can't be f***ed to keep up.-quick sidenote here, my friend and I got really into duos for a stretch, and we won a lot, so these complaints are not coming from someone just salty about losing. We were pretty good, i'm just tired of putting up w/ these painful issues to keep playing this game.4. The movement. I think it's the way the game manages player acceleration that makes it feel so bad, but it feels like you're constantly fighting the game to get your character to move how you want. Vaulting was definitely a necessary addition, and i think it was done pretty well, but oh man is the rest of the movement bad. A directional input from the player takes about a second or two for the character to get up to speed, and turning and jumping are directly tied to your current momentum, so it just feels like you have very little tight control of your character. Arma2 has better movement mechanics imo, and if you play Arma2, you know that says a lot. Now for things that are done well: 1. Battle Royale is fun. BR game modes are tense, exciting, and rewarding, and as much of a shame as it is, PUBG is really the only healthy BR game right now. 2. Sound design. Using sound to hone in on players or gunshots is not hard w/ a decent soundscape, and gunshots sound good. The actual gun's blast, the bullet's snap, and the report are all usually distinguishable and they add to the experience. Sometimes suppressors can make guns completely inaudible over the snap or the report, but so be it. Also suppressed shots generally sound very good within audible range. TLDR Compared to other battle royale games of the past: The Culling (in its first couple of combat iterations where it was genuinely a blast), H1Z1 (although it had its own slew of problems, it was fast paced, tight, and fun), and Arma3 BR (truly the peak of the BR genre IMO, but sadly arma is just not accessible enough to hold peoples' interest or collect a strong enough playerbase or audience), PUBG just doesn't meet some pretty easy standards of quality in my opinion, and i think people just don't know better than to just accept it for the only BR title to play and support atm. It's got some relatively bad network performance, only recently does it have decent clientside performance, it has inconsistent and frustrating gunplay, janky and loose movement that does not compliment a game of this style or intended pace, and it above all else just feels like it's going to be a forever Early Access title that was lost to a big publisher more interested in generating money and twitch/youtube stardom than developing a high quality game appreciated for anything more than the base concept of Battle Royale alone.
Yellowboost	Not Recommended	639.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983211591/	I don't know if I've ever left a review before, but the cheating in this game and the subsequent tone deaf comments from the games creator have really struck a nerve. "A few bad eggs" says Mr. Greene whilst also acknowledging that there's been upwards of 2 million accounts banned already. If you play the game, then you know what I'm talking about. There's a large number of cheaters and the majority of them appear to be Chinese. I don't care if they were from Australia, UK or Russia. If region locking servers or ping locking servers removes the excessive amount of Chinese hackers from the game, then let's do it. It's not a matter of race. It's simple facts. There are a lot of cheaters in this game and the majority of them are from China. If you want to region lock me to North America, by all means, region lock me. Why would I need to play on a server that I'm going to be pinging from across the Pacific? It's not racism. Cheaters are ruining this game and disallowing Chinese players to play on North American servers will ease the pain. The politically correct comments from the development team are ridiculous.

Rabidjackal	Not Recommended	686.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thedanimal1991/	While immensely flawed from the begining, PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers, my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's, and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence, it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China, and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion, it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz, Warz, and H1Z1 into irrelevancy.
Ishii-kun	Not Recommended	209.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ishii-kun/	Brendan Greene says cheaters are a small subset of players that do not overall impact the enjoyability of the game. Not only that, he says they're taking care of the issue.Meanwhile, the person that is #1 on the PUBG global scoreboard has a K/D of 99.67. That means, on average, that person kills every single person in their game room, single handedly. That stat is on the *PUBLIC LEADERBOARD* and he claims cheaters are a non-issue.Brendan Greene, how about you come down off your high horse, and join us in some actual games, and see the problem for yourself.
Apsallar	Not Recommended	1,469.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052924379/	Now the hackers and advertisers own it. I and my duo partner we were 500th in NA, from millions. At that level today there is a hacker almost every game. IT IS UNPLAYABLE.It was a fun game, thrilling and adrenaline pumping. I loved it once despite all the crap  devs who are over their heads here  shovelled on us.Crap like laggy servers, people glitching around, you car getting stuck and exploding for no reason, dying AFTER  getting into cover, terrible optimization and random frame drops, to mention a fie. AND NOTHING  BEING FIXED despite promises.All that I can live trough but playing  just to be shot by some one trough walls and across the map with a headshot.... thats enough. It is not even like counter strike where you can jump in the next game. Here you have spent 20 minutes looting and manoeuvring on the map for a hacker to blow you away effortlessly when he decides to.The worst is that the B.Hole team is doing nothing about it. Player Unknown, aka Glass Door, made millions from the sales promising to make things better. Then he focused on bringing microransactions in the game, then bringing in game adds we have to look at, even tought everyone of us payed for the game. 2 gigabit "patch" to introduce advertisements in game - Intel yey !!! You got to be kidding me!!!And now Glass Door is focused on getting the game out of Beta so he can cash on his contract with microsoft. microsoft wants the game on console and that's another pile of money for the taking, no matter hackers are running amok and players are begging for help. The cherry on top is B.Hole banning people for honking near streamers or god forbid if you kill them. Yet in the statistics the top players all with numbers or chinese names have 80 kill/ death ratio but thats no problem! (for comparison some one like shroud who is among the best players has 7.2Kill/death ratio). B.Hole erases those stats but ingame cheaters remain.DONT BUY THIS GAME untill the hackers have been dealt with and there are no more advertisements ingame plus whatever other pille of manure B.Hole is planning. Also you should know that Glass Door is offering the game in China and Russia for 15$ but would love to rip you off at double price. How much is he charging you for the game and to watch his adds?
SgtWoopAss	Not Recommended	566.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031763703/	I was one of the early birds for downloading this game when it was first made public for testing. This game had/has a lot of potential. When it started off the mechanics, and game play design were quite fun and intriguing. However, over the last 6 months, they have taken what promised to be a fun very challenging game, and basically buried it under a pile of money. What do I mean by that? Well let me explain. They have taken a fun game that millions of people have spent their hard earned cash to purchase, and turned it into a game that caters to the cheaters, and hackers. The developers have turned a blind eye to those of us who want to play a fair game. In order to play this game we ALL had to drop a few bucks for the original purchase price which I believe is $29.99. Multiply that my 3-5 million sold, and we have made this company very, very wealthy. Now as with any popular game, the cheaters, and hackers went right to work developing ways to get the advantage over those of us who use actual skill to play. Once they developed numerous cheats, and hacks, they started selling those to the not so honest gamer. Those gamer's then flood the game with their not so covert hacks, and they run around the map using either speed hacks, wall hacks or the most popular no recoil hack. In the beginning it was rare for me to be killed by one of these cheaters, as there were not to many of them. My first experience was with my crew of 4, all of whom are experienced high level 1st person shooter veterans like myself. We have been playing fps together for many years, and have been ranked top in the world on many platforms. That day we were near Severny on the original map, all 4 of us were headed to one of the bunkers just outside of town. Upon reaching the entrance one of my crew was dropped by a head shot from a 45 pistol. None of us had seen or heard anyone else near us. As he yelled into his mic for us to back him up, we all turned to head towards him, that's when we all saw our 1st blatant cheater. This person ran past us moving at the speed of a Dacia at full throttle, and as he buzzed a circle around us, he fired just 3 rounds from his 45, each round striking each of our team in the head. Needless to say none of us were to pleased to have spent the last 30 minutes of our time to get into the top ten left alive, only to have some unskilled looser rob us of a fun time. Now keep in mind we had all played for many hours at this point, and had only heard talk of cheaters, never had we experienced one, until then. Since that day, the number of cheaters have risen to a point that I can say with a strong belief, that every single round played now has 1 to 30 people per round using outside software to enhance there game, to a point that even highly skilled players cannot compete with. Why haven't the developers done anything about this you might ask. Well they have, they have done very little to be honest. They have banned a few million people for cheating already, but it is not a permanent ban, that person can create a new steam account, pay for the game again, and start over. But why would someone want to risk being banned, and then have to pay another $29.99 to get back in you might wonder. Well that's simple to explain as well. The company who created this game gets extra revenue, because they allow the once banned to repurchase another game, so they make more money that way. But its not the only way the company profits from these cheaters. The cheaters play as long as they can before they get banned, which is historically anywhere from a month to 3 months. During that time they rack up massive amounts of BP (in game fake money) that they then use to buy crates in the game. These crates contain skins for weapons, cloths, shoes, etc. Some crates you get, require a key to open them. The only way you can get a key is to purchase one from the company for real currency. Therefore making them even more profit. There is a real world demand for these items, and people sell them on the open marketplace for cash. Some items are worth over $1000 real world cash. So the longer the cheaters can stay in the game before they get banned, the more BP they acquire, and the more money they spend to buy keys. Then they turn around and sell the items they get on the marketplace, and make REAL money. Therefore the cheaters make more than enough to cover another game once they get banned, and the company gets richer. The only losers in this setup are the real gamer's, who mistakenly bought this game to challenge themselves, and to have fun. The Creators of this game have no intention of making it cheater, and hacker free, as that will lower the overall income they get. Lets face the facts,they wont get rich off of the not so honest players like they are now. Don't expect them to do anything more than they already are. They will make a big deal about how many people they banned in the last big sweep of catching cheaters, just like the last 6-7 times they have made this anouncment. But if you notice, and pay close attention, they only do that every few months. That way they give the cheaters time to profit so they can buy back in again before they run another ban sweep. Its all about the money to these people, not a single one gives a (*&^ about the real gamer's. The game used to be a blast, but now its a joke. I know that I, and many others will not waste our money on any games this company puts out in the future. They have proven themselves to be as worthless to the honest player as the hackers are. Don't waste your time, or money on this game. Unless you have low morals and want to make a profit from cheating, then this is a great game for you!

Writer of Dreams	Not Recommended	63.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/writersls/	I have been a player, or gamer, since I have memory. I have owned and played so many games in my life, and it became one of my favorite hobbies, probably the most favorite one. PUBG was not an exception. I got this game thanks to a close friend who I played with at least half of the hours I spent on this game.  We never were "good players" at all, and we never even got a chicken dinner. I got one tho,  in DUO with a random two months ago.  I was a bad player, or should I say, a regular player of this game, who barely made it to top 10, and also who died more than killed. I was a player like you, and like anyone else. I just played this for fun, like I do with the rest of my games.Which means I used to launch this game, put my headphones on and let the fun begin. Simple as that. No drama.And then, suddenly a morning I see on my steam profile a Game block warning, after almost four years of being an user here, and a constant online player ( as you can see on my profile, most of the games I own are multiplayer, because that is the kind of games I like).I got worried. I had no idea what was going on. I lightly punched my face to check if it was a nightmare.But it was not. It was real. I got a game block, a ban, a red big signal on my profile saying I had a game block."What the ****" I said. I checked as soon as I could from which game was this game block. It was PUBG. Devs of pubg decided to give a permanent ban as February gift. Back then I thought it was all a mistake, that it was going to be fixed. There was no way I could have been banned just like that, not with my stats, not with my record, my pc was clean as an empty recycle bin, I made  sure of it using Malwarebytes, Rkill, and so other softwares. The only software that runs in my background is Glasswire to track my network usage since I run a limited internet service and you can find it on Steam itself. "Why on earth would I be banned on this game, and WHY on this game? I played last night just fine and didnt got any BattleEye warning or anything similar, besides, its not the only online game I play. Glasswire couldnt have been  the responsible" I said. Nothing was out of the ordinary, my pc was fine, my internet was fine, the rest of my games were working good with their anticheat systems (Vac, BattleEye, EasyAntiCheat, and so many others) even though, I was still banned on PUBG, it was a fact, it was real.So I decided to send them a email reporting the missunderstanding. I needed to know a reason why. I needed them to know it was a mistake. My email was answered two days after that. It was a pre-generated email from PUBG, and it was pretty obvius since I made some contact with other people who was in the same boat as me. I asked them what PUBG answered them, they sent me exactly the same message I got. "If you have any concerns answer this email" Said at the end of their email.I had a lot of concerns, of course I had. So I wrote them back and I am still waiting for a more proper answer. Probably I will never get an answer. Why would they answer? They are rich already, I would not be surprised if they simply ignore the email. Fun fact is that even they are billionaire by this point they cant afford a proper customer service.As for today, I am still banned. Many of my friends texted me on Steam asking me what happened to me. "Were you hacking all this time?" A guy from CSGO said to me.  I answered him "Seems like being a loser at a game means you are hacking. No way you can be THAT bad. You must be hacking" He laughed off so bad. I feel sorry for my friend who got this game for me specially to play with me, and we had so much fun together, but for 30$ I expected a better customer service.  I feel sorry for myself too. I lost hours of my life in a game that ended treating me as a hacker, as a customer who does not have the right to have a proper reason why he was banned. I feel sorry for what the gaming Industry has become. I am not the first or last to be  unfairly banned on PUBG. Already met with couple people who are in the same position, and just like me, they havent got any proper reason stating why they were banned.While I am banned, "ChingChong4XXDestroyer" is at the top 10 in the leaderboard, with more kills than deaths, and of course, all of them being headshots from lot of meters away. Ironic.

MysticShades	Not Recommended	1,334.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198349018288/	I have almost 900 hours into this game so I think Iam capable of telling what is good and what is bad objectively. Without going into much details, I have to say this has been the worst time and moments to play PUBG. At all. Why you ask? Cheaters.The amount of cheaters running wild, specially in TPP, is absurd. It got to a point where its impossible to have a single normal game. Or you die fast at the landing, or you die by a cheater who is aim botting, wall hacking or God knows what. This is just sad because a cool interactive, funny game is being ruined by these people. Bluehole or whatever manages the company should start making moves about this... Stop the BP, region lock, no more loot selling, etc. Just do something.Until then, don't buy this game. Not like this.

So I decided to attack them with a car while yelling "BEEP, BEEP MOTHER F-UCKERS!" Killing him and his buddy. Ever since I have been banned for harassment, like wtf? So I spent 30 euros on a game and risk potential ban for a little horse play, its not Like I was constantly going at them or saying racial slurs etc. Really dumb!Edit:Going to keep the review negative, but I got unbanned! :3 Could be because of my review, and it gaining tension, but still was unjustified and ignorant reason for banning me for a little horse play.I didn' exploit anything, if honking the car horn and yelling "Beep Beep Mother ♥♥♥♥er" to a streamer gets me banned, that's extremely dumb. They should definitely start looking into a better system, instead of craddeling streamers balls.Edit again: Apparently I was banned for stream snipping. I was in a game with a well known streamer "Rock or Stone valley" Something on those lines. It was a group game, and I was the only one alive, and my friends were dead, and by chance, 1 of my friends was watching the streamer and realized I was in their game as when I killed someone my name popped up in the recent kills. So he told me, and me knowing well that I wasn't going to survive much longer with a shotgun and pistol with no health or armour, got into a vehicle and charged straight at them while having my mic turned on "Intentionally" while honking and yelling into the mic. " BEEP BEEP MOTHE♥♥♥♥ERS" I instantly killed both of them, they were behind a couple of bushes.I got banned, reason was for harrasment and there was no timer indicating a suspension.Tried contacing the developers, with no response to this day.To clear things up for whom ever reads this review. I still strongly believe I did not deserve a ban, or any punishment really as it was mere horseplay, and just having fun.

You are sitting behind a bush, your back protected by a rock and you are scoping the area in front of you with the 8x Kar98, 11 people left and you sure know you are going to  the top 10, hell even might get that sweet dinner and then you see a guy crawl past you. Like a predator you slither towards him and shoot your shotgun, he doesn't die but has no idea where you are so shoots a couple of rounds 10 meters away from your torso and you die of a headshot. Angelina Jolie curving bullets like Wanted? NO (I wish). Hacks? HELL YES! Sure it has 3 million players but I wonder how many are ACTUAL players because our wonderful hackers have multiple accounts to not only cover their shady practices but also ruin the community market by farming multiple crates, resulting in a crash of the whole PUBG economy. I sure don't hate the game and am happy that it's a good concept and the next big thing in multiplayer gaming but it is the plague of hackers and their never ending bulllshit that has ruined it. There is no option for us normal players to even play a single round without seeing a guy rambling 'China namba oan' or hearing an android woman's voice  advertising the hacks.

PUBG, you're breaking my heart. You're going down a path I can't follow." The first major problem with the game is that hacking is rampant.... and I mean RAMPANT....  9 out of ever 10 matches you will encounter hackers. Mostly with names like 99998330287 and yes as much as I hate to join the club, it is 99% Chineses players that are hacking. 2nd with the roll out of the new map tomorrow comes the "NEW" Event Pass system...  what is it you ask?  Well in a nutshell you will be paying for newmaps and items..  ( Think Fortnite )  the major difference there is Fortnite is free to begin with PUBG is not.... bad move ...  finding a new way to charge the playerbase more money... 3rd the hit detection is just bad in this game... If you play it ... you will die a few seconds after you turn a corner and are moving away completely out of line of site... it will happen often.Now having gotten why I gave it a thumbs down out of the way....  I have had a blast in this game and made several new gaming friends.  The game has provided me with hours of enjoyment and laughter along with some heartpounding intense moments in battles...

As you can see from my hours played, I do enjoy the core game experience of a battle royale with semi-realistic mechanics. However, the developer is working very hard on ruining the experience by creating 3 classes of customers: the ALMIGHTY STREAMER, who allegedly can get players banned by his word alone. The FOOL, who pays real money to unlock crates to get clothing items. And finally, the PLEB PLAYER, who is at the butt of the joke.Before we get into the 3 classes of customers, what is this about? Well, the developer made 3 relevant statements:There will be no microtransactions in EA.There will be microtransactions for cosmetics only (no guns, no armor, no camo clothes) after EA.There will probably be no more free crates after EA.No. 1 turned out to be a lie as there are were microtransactions in EA with the Gamescom crate and all the clothes are on the Steam marketplace now.No. 2 is nonsense to me as there are clearly clothing items that are better at camo than others. Visibility is not just cosmetic in a game like pubg. See video above.No. 3 means that you won't be able to collect a camo-esque outfit after EA for free. You will be forced to pay money for it. You could also find a camo-esque piece of clothing in a match, but it's pretty obvious that someone who starts with a full camo outfit will be at an advantage over someone who has to be lucky and find all the parts in a match. Additional info: you don't keep the clothes you find in a match. Only clothes from lottery crates are yours to keep._THE CLASS SYSTEMNow let's look at the ALMIGHTY STREAMER:Streamers get custom servers with their own game modes and settings.The almighty streamer can claim his death was due to "stream sniping" and allegedly get his killer banned. He simply has to get salty after dying and the devs allegedly ban the pleb players.Since the devs included the car horn, it's even better. Players are getting banned, because streamers claim they get harrassed by "stream honking". So you use the horn of a car and a streamer feels annoyed, you allegedly might get banned.Let's look at the FOOL:The fool pays for clothes and thinks: it's only cosmetic, it doesn't give an advantage. He thinks that only the ghillie suit gives an advantage. This not true. There is already camo clothing in the game that gives an advantage. The clothing items in Pubg are NOT the same as weapon skins in CSGO.This crate crap attracts bots to farm ingame currency and gambling sites. I don't like fraudulent shenanigans.Let's look at the PLEB PLAYER:Having fun is ok, but if you want first class support you better be a popular streamer.Having fun is ok, but if you want an advantage, you probably will have to pay for "purely cosmetic" items that camouflage you._CONCLUSIONYou will die or find yourself at a disadvantage caused by a bug, bad performance or lag at least once per play session - but if you play this as a lighthearted romp, the derpy state of the game might actually add to the fun. How the dev can perceive his game as "e-sports ready" in this state is a mystery though. Same goes for the microtransactions and streamer drama.That's why I'd recommend the buggy broken game from a few weeks ago before they added paid crates, but cannot recommend the buggy game that wants to be an e-sport with a p2w lottery crate system.

Quintus	Not Recommended	423.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044478803/	This game can be fun. Don't get me wrong, I have over 300 hours on it, and I've enjoyed it. I have to say for now, I don't recommend it. The problem for me is that this one map is getting old, but even more than that, the hackers are getting out of control. The leaderboards are full of Wg_qun-xxxxxxxx (or some variation), I've been headshot more and more often by one of these kinds of accounts while watching 3-4 others die within seconds of me all from headshots, all from the same guy. It's obvious, it's getting worse, and in a game where you spend 15+ minutes looting and only get one chance per match, I don't want to waste that time just to die to some Chinese aimbot account. I can live with the bugs, I can live with the single map for now, I can even live with the server issues and continually having the asian server selected after every match even though I'm in North America, but the hacking is rampant, and obvious, and really just ruins the game for me.I know this is early access, and I hope they will do something about it, but this is a problem with every shooter i've played, and as long as people are paying for access to these hacks, they're not going to stop. It shouldn't be that hard to spot them with their 40+ k/d ratios and thousands of headshots in under 100 matches. Maybe start banning these guys instead of people streamers complain about? Just a thought.Edit:For the love of God region lock the servers! This Chinese ping exploit on NA servers is ruining the game.

Large enough that you aren't always on top of another player (Unless you purposely land in an area with others), vehicles are useful, while also being small enough that generally it's not a painful chore to run somewhere ++SPECTATOR MODE IN TEAMS (No more sitting staring at a death screen for 20 minutes waiting for your teammates, while also making your teammates feel guilty for "leaving you behind" ) -Server stability (There are semi frequent heavy lag spikes that can affect the entire server, from what I heard this wasn't as bad in the closed beta, hopefully this will be resolved soon) -Performance/Optimization is quite bad (For many, many people) in this, IF you don't apply some commands/launch parameters to the game. (I personally went from 25-40 fps on medium and very low, to 55-65 by inputting a simple launch parameter, this command/launch parameter "fix" does NOT work for everyone) Aside from those 2 negatives I cannot think of anything else that's bad enough to be worth mentioning. Overall this game is great, even if doing solos, but is even more fun when playing with friends, I would entirely recommend it to a friend, so long as their PC is capable of handling it, or if the launch parameter works for themSystem specs the game was played on:Intel Core i7 6700 HQ Skylake 3.6 ghzNvidia GTX 960m 2GB 16gb's DDR4 2133mhzWindows 10 (System was an ASUS ROG gaming laptop) EDIT: For those who may be looking for the launch parameter me and friends used:Navigate to the game in your libraryRight click and go to properties, click "Set Launch Options" and enter the following command-USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system -sm4

Constantly dying behind cover. To get good at this game, you will have to learn to use the terrible netcode to your advantage. I enjoy the gameplay a lot but it's ruined by dying 50% due to the awful networking. They seem to only focus on making new paid crates, presumably because they know this game won't survive long term. I can't recommend this game, despite playing hundeds of hours. I thought this stuff would improve over time but it hasn't.

jxzR-/Tenkai/	Not Recommended	312.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jackzRRRR/	So after nearly 200 hours of gameplay, and a multitude of ups and downs in this game. I finally decided to collect my thoughts and share them here.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS (Henceforth known as Pubg) is a battle royale shooter, similar to ArmA 2/3 BR and H1Z1. The concept is simple, 100 players drop out of a plane over an island or a Trump-Wallesque desert, scrounge up the best gear they can find, and kill each other. Last man/woman standing wins, but you don't really need to hear that, the game has been out for nearly a year, and if you haven't heard of Pubg by now, then I don't even know anymore.Pubg does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit. The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two. The movement, for the most part is good. However I will touch on this a little later.Despite the multitude of things that Pubg gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game. Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping.Desync itself is still a major issue, with major rubberbanding, hit registration and a plethora of other issues still plaguing this game. A recent example of this would be when I unloaded 20 bullets from a Scar-L, point blank into an enemies chest, only for them to soak it up, turn around and drop me in two shots. The death cam registered three bullets hitting him. THREE. There was more than three blood sprays shooting from his body, so my client registered that bullets had hit, but the server did not. I was on an EU server, with 40 ping. This again ties in to my earlier point regarding movement. While the movement is pretty solid, the fact that the desync, coupled with the games rubberbanding issues are still present. Movement is more often than not a challenge. When your game struggles to handle something as basic as movement fluidly. We got a problem.These issues, while major, could be overlooked to a certain extent if the game remained in early access. This is where one of my main gripes remains. This is sold to the end user as a finished product. A game rampant with hackers, lag issues, server desync, and basic hit registration issues, is not only being sold as a full game, but is also touted as 'eSports ready'. A game in which the chances of you actually hitting someone seem all but randomized, is considered 'eSports ready'.However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day.Do I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played. Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale.TL:DR This game is good, but it's also trash. Play Fortnite instead, that actually works.EDIT: To those thinking that my comment about playing Fortnite was real, it wasn't. I was being facetious, if anything it's worse than pubg, considerably so. I was just making a joke about how bad PUBG can be. Chill with the salt boys.
Snoopeh	Recommended	77.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrSnoopeh/	PROS:  REALLY fun. Huge variety or weapons and attachements (for a game in this genre) Perfectly sized map Squad/duo play is amazing and overall very tactical Mappable controls! (severely understated in most games) Great server loactions (Asia, NA, South America, EU and OCE) Devs keep the community informed! MORE DEVS SHOULD DO THIS!!!CONS:  Can be laggy/FPS drops at times (not often though) Is a resource heavy game, not all PCs will run it. (Currently being optimised according to devs)Overall, very fun and worth the extra money compared to other games in the genre. It isn't "cartoony" at all and is a serious contender on Steam. The hype was a good thing, not overly hyped and well deserved from playing it so far.Although the servers need optimising, I'll be spending many more hours playing this, because the developers actually care.

Oblivion | Supa スパ	Not Recommended	1,402.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/supadupanoodle/	AbstractA game with a lot of potential with high hardware requirements, but ruined, brought down and destroyed by Chinese cheaters and the development team who refuse to solve the problem. Do NOT buy.Feel free to ask any specific questions you have and I will answer right away.ReviewAt its heart, the concept of gameplay that PUBG has developed is extremely fun. It offers a unique combination of first person shooter skills, third person strategy, teamwork, randomness and luck, that makes the rare wins exhilarating and memorable, and the many, many, many lost games frustrating. In addition, the inclusion of vehicles, the need to travel long distances, and the random glitches sometimes produce moments of hilarity and laugh-out-loud ludicrousness that itself provides entertainment making the game worth the price.However, all of this is severely tainted by two major problems. First, the game is severely unoptimized, buggy, and laggy. The netcode is a disaster, with round-the-corner damage very common, and unrecognized hits on enemies. Server performance varies from game to game and region to region. Desynchronization between the players and servers is a regular occurrence, and was in fact horrendous at the time of the official 1.0 release, which was rushed out before Christmas 2017 in order to garner the most sales. This led to major rubber-banding, where if more than 5 or 6 people landed in the same area at the beginning of the match, you would all be fighting the server more than each other, as you took one step forwards only to be pulled two steps back as the servers struggled to synchronize everyone’s positions. Later updates did improve the situation, but a lot of damage has been done.The next issue is hacking. Cheats are readily available for the game, and aimbot, speedhack, no recoil, wallhack, invisibility and other hacks are all in use. The cheaters are rampant and destroy most matches with their illegal and unfair advantages. I have played many other games for hundreds of hours, and have never seen such a prevalence of cheaters anywhere before. It is completely out of control and destroys the community, the gaming experience, and leads to a complete waste of precious leisure time.These two problems, desynchronization and cheating, are exploited the most by Chinese players. All the cheaters I have come across are Chinese, and all the abuse of the netcode, by using high ping to sponge bullets, is also done by Chinese players. We know they are Chinese based on their names, or because they have long numbers and letters for names but speak loudly in all-chat in Mandarin. Furthermore, they often enter Solo games but while in the pre-game lobby they communicate with each other and team up, and then play in squads against the rest of the server who are playing as individual solo players. This is called “teaming” and is a banning offence, however it is not being policed. There is also evidence of “teaming” even in squad games, where 10 or more Chinese players make teams (when 4 is the maximum per team), using the in-game clothing items to coordinate and organize themselves. They have flooded every regional server, be it EU, NA, Australia, or Korea/Japan.The reason I do not recommend this game is ultimately not because of these issues as such, but because of the response of the developers. Being the most popular game on Steam and the most popular game in China with the largest population in the world, the developers have no financial incentive to shut down and ban Chinese accounts – even if they do, the cybercafés where most of these Chinese hackers play from will have made more than enough money to buy a new account for their customers to continue cheating from. Cheats mean fun for Chinese players, money for the developers, but misery for everyone else in the world.The developers have known about netcode and game optimization issues from the beginning, but have instead focussed on a rushed Xbox port, commercialization through loot crates, and lucrative deals, such as a mobile-phone version for the Chinese market. They have not fixed the structural problems with the game, and have done nothing about the cheaters. What’s worse, they even shut down all discussion about Chinese cheaters.The game requires a very powerful PC to run smoothly, with a 10 series Nvidia card (preferably 1070 or higher), 16GB RAM, and at least a recent i5 processor. There is no way the minimum requirements of an “i3, 6GB RAM and a GTX 660” can run this game. I had to upgrade my graphics card and RAM before I could play this properly. I have supported this game since Early Access and also having invested so much money and time into what is clearly a great concept, the game is not recommendable because of the terrible playing experience brought about by the Chinese cheaters and the developers’ stubborn refusal to address the issue.Conclusion Not recommended. DO **NOT** BUY.I will only recommend the game when Chinese players are region-locked to their own regional servers, and when all the netcode and hitregistry issues are sorted out. We don’t need bells and whistles but some basic stability and a fair playing environment for all paying customers.
mrbibs350	Not Recommended	79.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080380077/	I go back and forth so much on this game, but ultimately I don't think it's polished or competitive. It's not a game of skill and thought. It's "Who has the best rig" vs. "Who can anticipate the lagginess of the game".It's not polished. It takes a tremendous machine just to make the game playable at all. And it's not stable, it'll kick you out in the middle of a game without warning. The only real enjoyment I get is from playing with friends. If you don't have someone who specifically wants to play the game with you you aren't going to have a good time. You'll run around for 20 minutes collecting loot for the person who kills you without you seeing them. It's not a game in the sense that you want to win. The goal is to ruin someone else's game. Because every kill is a frustration for someone, every death is a chore of "well, now I have to do all that♥♥♥♥♥♥again."The real game is the last 10 people. Everything else is just random time filler where you probably won't see anyone. You're just running in an emtpy field looking for the one (of a dozen) weapons that you can win with. And ultimately, I just can't reccomend the game. It's too unrefined, it's too frustrating to play, and the only payoff is the knowledge that you ruined someone else's night.
Pro@beingNOOB!	Not Recommended	928.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HerbFreak/	This is one of the best games out there but also the worst. Its about time i give my review on this game. This game has left early access but has still not been well optimized. Bluehole is supposed to keep the cheaters and hackers away but every damn game u would end up dieing to a cheater or hacker who shoots through walls miles away , aimbots etc. I do love the game but i hate it the same time. Instead of fixing these issues they keep giving out new crates and weapon skin where some u need to buy keys to open crates. Arnt the developers happy with the amount they have made already  ? They seem to be greedy for more money rather than fixing the above issues. Get the issues fixed and i would be the first to update my review.

Bubbulicious	Not Recommended	956.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987415558/	Can't Recommend this game right now. Hackers are infesting the servers and Bluehole is doing nothing about it. They claim to be banning a ton of accounts, but every leaderboard is still filled with hackers. If  you enjoy being killed by someone you can't see or hear, buy this game.Edit: I have been running into less and less hackers, which is nice. The client side hit detection, server lag, and lack of executable timeline still bothers me and makes me not want to recommend the game. However, it is alot of fun.Edit 2: Great new release. The gameplay is fun, smooth, different and enjoyable. Feels almost like a brand new game. Thank god they added the deathcam so I can now at least feel validated when I am killed by a hacker. Still hacks on hacks, cannot recommend until they region lock.Edit 3: Still winning games. The new map is so fun, I am having a blast. Yet... Still. STILL. Running into a hacker at least every 2 games. Bluehole won't region lock because China is big money. Sooooooooooo with no solution in sight, why recommend this game? Hardly matters with how many chinese accounts there are...Edit 4: I now exclusively play First Person because of the hacking issue. This has been a decent temporary fix. However, still no region lock, still no server side hit detection, and still high ping desync issues. They have now made hundreds of millions of dollars but no long term solution in sight.Edit 5: Never have I played a game that has received this much money, support, and recognition from its player base. Never have I played a game that continually had issues with hackers, server stability and desync killings.

The Citizen Kane of Movies	Not Recommended	388.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BatFive/	I really want to like this game.  I really do, but it's just not good, especially compared to other BR options, it's just not worth the money.  The game had so much potential, but the devs screwed it up.  I gave this game so many chances, and then they add $10 battle pass thing.  It's stupid.  I already paid $30 dollars for your poorly optimized buggy game, and then instead of fixing it you add something that should be free and charge $10 for it.  The netcode is absolute garbage, on my screen I can shoot a guy in the face 10 times and server side he won't take damage.  The countless bugs can be annoying or game-breaking, making you lose to something that isn't your fault.  The game can be fun, but most of the time it isn't.  I really wanted this to be a good game, I was a huge fan for a long while, but it's just not good.  Spend your money elsewhere.

CenturionV	Not Recommended	701.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964310683/	Had a bit of time in the game now so I feel semi-qualified to rate it.The gameplay loop and idea is fun, the execution unfortunately is not and in its current state I can't recommend you get into it if you haven't already. Yeah the rush of an end game kill and chicken dinner is fun, and the gun battles (when they aren't bugging, glitching or full of hackers) can be pretty good, map design, graphics and sounds are all average to poor. Where it really starts to go bad is in the technical aspects. The game is an absolute mess, patches break things that were already fixed and version control appears to not exist, performance zig-zags up and down depending on dozens of unknown factors (time of day, is this a "good" or "bad" patch, are the servers trash today or somehow stable, are people lagging or desyncing all over for the first 5 minutes, the most important and dangerous part of the game until the end) even my brand new i7 8700k, GTX 1080, and 16 gb ram randomly has what appear to be framerate lag issues for no reason on a brand new fresh install of windows 10 on an SSD. Meanwhile the developers work to add the next loot box or skin, trying desperately to squeeze every last drop of blood they can before the playbase disappears due to rage/burnout from the endless issues or newer better battle royale games ecplipse and destroy PUBG.Prepare to hit invisible stuff in your car and explode, spray down enemies and never do damage, hackers to blast your head off from 400 metres away when you peaked for a less than 0.1 seconds, watch in shock and awe as your character dies seconds after rounding a corner to safety as your lag ghost gets gunned down by an enemy who could see you for extra seconds due to desync. Enjoy fun games like loot loading in after you have already run through a room giving the guy who landed seconds AFTER you a free AK47 at point blank range while you stand in amazement with a pack of bandages and a backpack as your only items, or maybe the AK DOES actually spawn but you mash "F" to pick it up 28 times without being able to grab it and your enemy leasurely blows you away with a hand loaded revolver he managed to pick up 8 seconds ago. Prepare to fire into the walls or roof at random when your character decides to raise his weapon or unload a mag into the windowframe because of the "sweet" realistic gun barrel detection. All the while new skins and packs are added by the listless developer in a desperate attempt to cash in on fanboys and kids who have free access to daddy and mommy's credit card and promises fixes which haven't come for literally years (bugs from early alpha are still in the game unfixed) Don't take my word for it though, there are streamers with 30 times the playtime I have that have endlessly documented the sad state of the game in video format.Yes the game can be fun, yes I still play (i've invested a lot of time and its a game me and my friends all can just go and chill and play) but recommend, no I can't do that, the game is a disaster and if past attempts are any indication it will probably continue to be so indefinitely. Maybe some day the devs will use the millions upon millions of dollars earned by this monstrosity to actual make an enjoyable game that will be played for years or decades and become a classic FPS like CSGO or Rainbow 6 Seige but my hopes aren't that high based on the past track record.All in all I can't recommend it at this time, with a lot of work and effort this could be a great game, maybe even one of the greatest, but its still so far from that state and I sadly must question if getting it to that place is even that high of a priority due to recent DLC like the battlepass and constant adding of new content when so much of the game is in desperate need of repair. Just fix the game already.

There's a lot of downtime where you're just walking or looting, but each time you win a match it's fairly satisfying. Even after leaving early access and improving many aspects of the game it still feels very rough around the edges.

Why not make paid crates exactly that. Paid. Why take normal unpaid crates away from regular players, trying to force/guilt players into buying a key to unlock what is essentially useless crates in their inventory. Almost as bad as gambling. What a great incentive to pave children into a life of gambling and forking out their hard earned pocket money just to make a quick buck. - I would suggest not buying this game and saving your money for the next game that's worth it.

Yes, I had 3 (three) PUBG clients in my steam bib at one point. I enjoyed the game and played it from EA release in 03/2017 until 03/2018 because for the last three months everything the devs have achieved has fallen apart:- Terrible performance, no improvement in the last 3 months- Same update release cycle, putting the updates on live servers after two days of testing ignoring negative feedback from the test servers- Basically no new content, no progression system- Removal of ping and region lock without further explanation- Broken matchmaking systemAnd if all of this wasn't enough they have just presented "their" newest idea: An event pass for 9,99 including some progression system/leveling and temporary (!) skins. Wow. Just wow. Bluehole and PUBG Corp have failed multiple times regarding PR and communication and making strange decisions ignoring their fanbase and this is a new low, even for their standards.

[Ж] ATwelveYearOldGirl	Not Recommended	429.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/freedomdestinysaviour/	As insanely fun as this game is, the increasing number of hackers has really ruined the experience. I know this is in "pre-alpha" lol @Day-Z. So there is "time for improvement" but let's be honest here. When you get headshot, in the BACK of the head, with a crossbow, whilst you're in a boat, out way past the military base near Nova, and you're in the blue zone... Something's wrong with that.If you're looking for a blast with friends, Circa 2016 for this game, but as it stands, with the amount of client side abuses available, it's getting very hard to have fun. However, should it get fixed, and should the hackers get permabanned and possibly IP locked. Then you'll probably see a good game. Otherwise try Fortnight, it looks like a blast with a crazy good ban system implemented to combat hackers.Oh oh oh, the best part is, the devs consistently tell us they are banning a large number of "cheaters", but yet this reports come up from all over... Hmm.It's probably because servers are not country/continentally locked. BUT WHO KNOWS. Anyways, as rant ridden as this is.TL:DR - Until Hackers are banned, and less is placed on client side, play something elseOtherwise it's fun, but prepare to have your game ruined.
keirt	Not Recommended	147.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/keirt/	- review updated on June 2018 (3D sound update) - (updated part will be in strike or italic)1. GameplayYou drop from plane, loot weapons, kill anyone you see, last man standing win. The gameplay is good, better than other battle royale games. Very competitive, except if you face the enemy I list on no 4 below.2. Graphic and SoundSound was terrible at the early release, awful. But they start to improve it one by one, but for me, it's still below average, the 3D gun sound update is a welcomed addition, and for character sound instead of screaming in pain your character will make funny sound when get hurt. Graphic is, well even it is looks good even at low quality, but it is poorly less optimized. The color is somewhat dull.3. PerformanceUmm, I don't know. Still many some performance issue but overall it's way better than earlier early access era, and the server itself still lagging sometimes.4. The enemiesIn this game you will face many enemies, the main 4 enemies are:- Cheaters (yes still), - Lags (yes still),- Bugs (yes still), and- StreamersYou can't win or it's hard to win against them, with exception the streamers, if you kill them or honk near them 9/10 chance you will get banned. So pick your victim wisely, basically you'll need sixth sense or stream-but-not-snipe them to tell if they are streamers or not.5. BugsThis game feature so many game breaking bugs and glitches, some of them are:- Silent Buggy, you hit by a car that came without sound - fixed,- Render fail and walking and see through building (yes still),- Teleporting spot, send you to the sky or to the edge of the map (yes still),- Can walking inside some rock, wall, hay, or plane on military base and many walls on Miramar (yes still),- Bodies rendered to another place when driving vehicle, and if your another body killed you will die on that vehicle too,- Vehicle stuck on illogical spot and explode immediately (yes still),- Vehicle drop to "underworld" (yes still),- Stuck on sky while parachuting (yes still),- On squad, sometimes if you knocked out on a bike, you can still drive that bike while on dying position and it's impossible to revived,- Killer Lag, you literally killed after the server lag and get placed on 98th rank even there was like 30 players alive or even on top 10 before that lag kill you. (yes still)- and some more bugs6. VerdictI don't know if I can recommend this game or not, even this game reach version 1.0, it still have major problems. For me this game is still an old sh!t that just tweaked on some area and added more and more skins/cosmetics, no major bugs fixed, and still have a lot of cheaters. I will update this review if they fixed or improve things on future updates.

妈妈！	Not Recommended	795.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063710885/	As a player who has more than 400 hours on this game I must admit that it is a great game. My background is a player who bought the game relatively early (before vector and motorcycles were introduced) and has access to both English and Chinese communities. As the game progressed through, a lot new features had been introduced and did make the game more interesting e.g. new weather, new weapons and even new map (desert map) and new vehicle coming soon. Along with that I have heard that there will be new ranking system (like overwatch and League of Legends). HOWEVER, I’m giving this game a NOT RECOMMENDED, despite all the new features,  Bluehole has done a poor job on making the game optimized, it has been around half a year now with the game becoming more and more popular, from earlier this year when I first played the game till now, my average fps only increased by around 10. I have a fairly average PC specs: GTX970 + i7 4790k + 16RAM. In order to have a competitive game play, I even adjusted some graphics options to very low in order to make my life easier on spotting enemies, yet I am still getting 60-70 fps, sometimes the fps even drops to 40 which makes a shooting game unplayable especially I have a 144hz screen. And I do get crashes around 2-3 times every 4 hours (thank god they have reconnect option now but it still ruins your experience) Another factor that completely destroys the game is cheating/hacking. I know it is impossible to completely get rid of it in any games, but I do not see any progressive moves against cheating from bluehole. From the information I get access to (including Chinese forums, video websites etc.) there are way too many cheater than we thought. Aimbot, bullet tracking, speed boosting, resource distribution and many other functions. Some are easy to tell like when you get one shotted by a ump9 from 200 metres with a headshot when you have a level 2 helmet equipped (happened 2 days ago), or people just know where you are inside the house despite that you did not make any movement; but some are hard, without death recap like some other games e.g. overwatch, some hacks are extremely hard to be detected by normal players. Hence it is all the developer’s job to cleanse the environment. But I still see suspicious kills every day. Bluehole is trying to introduce more and more new feature but before that, promising a good experience to current players is the priority, please make the game optimized and also bring some punishment to cheaters and I will not update this review before I see any significant updates.

oleishte	Not Recommended	2,016.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198090055467/	1.0 has been launched and lag issue has become unbearable. If you drop to a place with 2 or more people, the lag continues for at least 5 minutes and it is not a normal lag where you try to open a door and it gets opened 2 seconds later.  You can't go forward, because it is like you go 2 meter forward, suddenly you find yourself 1 meter behind where you started. And it is not once in a while issue, it is continuous for god damn 5 minutes. It is said in the news that "the combined excitement of everyone has melted the servers", which is a pretty lame excuse. Buy more servers for gods sake, dont be such a penny pincher. Other than that, I think the v1.0 looks quite good, and it is fun to play if you can stand the lag. I could not stand it, and will not probably play until this issue is fixed.

Humblebee	Not Recommended	133.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sqlkysely/	EDIT 28/6/2018: Bluehole has withdrawn the lawsuit against Fortnite. While I would say this is a good thing to happen, I will still leave this review up to be read as it was originally written. To quote JFK: "Forgive your enemies, but never forget their names." Same principle: While we can be happy that Bluehole has withdrawn the lawsuit, the fact that they have done this lawsuit in the first place (and other scummy practices in the past) means that people need to keep a watchful eye on Bluehole and PUBG so that this stuff doesn't happen again. I still stand by the things I've said here, and I hope this review will still highlight just how scummy Bluehole can be as a developer studio for those who were not around and/or aware of the lawsuit filed against Fortnite.To say that this game is the worst of the battle royale games is a blatant lie. I will not deny that PUBG was the key contributor to bringing the battle royale genre to what it is today. The gameplay can range from boring and mundane walking through empty plains to heartpounding and sweat-inducing thrills. Comparing it to Fortnite would, in my opinion, be semi-pointless because both of them handle the gameplay very differently. In the end, it comes down to personal preference, and if you like PUBG, then the more power to you. I won't deny that the game is good, successful or how it changed some things in the game industry. So wait, if I'm saying the game is good, then why am I not recommending it? Because of the developers and their attitude towards any game developer who dares to utter the term "battle royale".Bluehole has lost a lot of respect for me over the time I've had their game. With the addition of lootboxes before full release (not that adding them in was a good thing to begin with), lack of bug fixes and optimization, and a VERY inflated ego over the success of their game, Bluehole has shown very little incentive to actually make their game a more fun experience and instead focuses on taking out the competition by issuing lawsuit after lawsuit over incredibly petty issues, like having a frying pan (which Bluehole states is "iconic to PUBG" and apparently therefore cannot be used in any other game), weapons (PUBG bases their own weapons on real life weapons, yet they have the nerve to say they own this?) and a rubber chicken that had nothing to do with PUBG in the first place, but Bluehole then claimed that it was referring to their "iconic" Winner Winner Chicken Dinner victory statement (I don't think it even needs to be said, but I'm fairly certain they did not create this statement).Then comes the Fortnite lawsuit. Remember when I said comparing PUBG to Fortnite would be semi-pointless? Well, Bluehole seems to disagree. There is no doubt that when Fortnite hit the scene, it did many of the things that PUBG did and improved on them, it was free, different and because of all that it took the world by storm. Epic Games themselves admitted that they were inspired by PUBG to make their own version in Fortnite, yet Bluehole seemed to have understood "inspired by" as "we stole content from", which is absolutely not the case. Now that Fortnite skyrocketed past PUBG, Bluehole is trying its best to bring it down, and for a game that's already as successful as PUBG, that is just sad.I find it funny that Fortnite, possibly one of the most original looking battle royale games out there to date, is being accused of stealing content by developers of PUBG, which is known to have used stock assets. Nothing wrong with using premade assets and I will not fault Bluehole for doing it, especially since they're one of the few game devs who actually used premade assets properly. But I find it ironic that a game that has used assets not made by themselves is claiming copyright over a game that has made its own assets from scratch... and funnily enough, they're focusing their lawsuit on gameplay aspects more than anything... You know, basically for being in the battle royale genre.Bluehole wants devs to enter the battle royale scene, but seem to be actively suing any major title creators who do it, and only because they don't want competition. If we were to go insert their logic as standard in the game industry, then platformer games would be owned by Nintendo, and games like Mega Man or LittleBigPlanet wouldn't exist. First Person Shooters would be owned by id Software, and Activision would have never made it big with Call of Duty. Bluehole seemed to be a big innovator, but now they seem like the antithesis of innovation.For this reason, I do not want to recommend this game. If Bluehole wants to take out their drop in fame on other games more popular than theirs, then I don't think that they deserve your time or money. So again, the quality of the game is good enough to be enjoyable, but the attitude of the developers is something that we do not need in the game industry.Also, if Bluehole actually got away with this lawsuit, it could set a very dangerous precedent where game devs would be able to sue others for just as petty things, and the game industry would be filled with nothing but false and frivolous lawsuits between companies, big or small. Food for thought.

The developers are only bothered for money and never tried to fix the anti cheat.They started off very well using twitch streamers to make the game known to all and it was real fun to play before the 1.0 update. Sadly everything started going downhill after that and every game has hackers who wallhack, auto aim, no recoil and so on. Wish the developers take notice and stop such before the game is dead.The graphics and gun mechanics are really good, if it wasn't for these damn hackers the game would be great. So developers there is still time to make things right. Start banning the people for using hacks, watch a few matches of the top 100 people as there are some with unusual figures.

Take a look at the Custom Match list. They're not even streamer and mostly unknown people who hosted the server, how did they get the server? Some hacker clans (if you play long enough you know the hacker clans) have their own custom server????PUBG Support is really useless.I contacted PUBG Support and reported players hacking with A CLEAR VIDEO OF EVIDENCE (snake hack/instant heal/aimbot...etc-etc)... The next day I play, it's the same players AGAIN.Contacted them and guess what... "WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THIS PLAYER...WAITING FOR A NUMBER OF REPORTS TO..."waiting for numbers of reports? What a waste of time trying to talk to them.The game used to be good... Very good.

Schervonne	Not Recommended	690.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/schervonne/	After a long hours of playing this game, I can say that I would not recommend this unless you're here for memes.If not, save the money, buy drug instead.Developers didn't care about the players and adding more and more ridiculous crates.They promised no cosmetic. What is this?Are you guys trying to imitate EA? What are you going to release next? DLC for PUBG?Full released game? I can see this game probably going to be F2P... just like H1Z1. This game is full of bugs and hackers. I am thankful for devs for fixing this but sometimes fixing it making it more broken.Region-lock?They say "there is no reason to region lock." - 2017Why Now? When most streamers moved to Fortnite or other games, they are trying to clickbait the players again with this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. They promised us custom server but where is it? Only available for Youtuber/Twitch streamer with 50,000 subs / 150 concurrent views. But how did some people with no-name or whatsoever can have their own custom server? Take a look at the Custom Match list. They're not even streamer and mostly unknown people who hosted the server, how did they get the server? Some hacker clans (if you play long enough you know the hacker clans) have their own custom server????PUBG Support is really useless.I contacted PUBG Support and reported players hacking with A CLEAR VIDEO OF EVIDENCE (snake hack/instant heal/aimbot...etc-etc)... The next day I play, it's the same players AGAIN.Contacted them and guess what... "WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION AGAINST THIS PLAYER...WAITING FOR A NUMBER OF REPORTS TO..."waiting for numbers of reports? What a waste of time trying to talk to them.The game used to be good... Very good. I really or...used to love the game.I'm very dissapointed of what it has become.Until they enforce a strong anti-hack/VAC ban or whatsoever measure to fight the hackers and fix the game, I might change the review...For now, RIP PUBG.P.S. Still playing with friends for MEMES.

M1	Not Recommended	199.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/m1michael/	After months tolerating the game being poorly optimized, laggy and buggy, the final nail in the coffin is that I now can't even play the game at all. Problems with the Battleeye service prevent me from being able to progress past initially loading into a lobby. Lots of other people have this issue and while there are many solutions out there (found by the community, not the developers) that work for some, none have worked for me, and many others report the same. Maybe the issue will be finally looked into by the time of official release, but regardless, I can't recommend a game that I spent money on and now can't even play. I guess at only $30 it's hard to complain, but I'd rather spend my time on actual quality games, or at least games that function on the most basic level.

And i can say it WAS amazing because altough it was buggy as hell, it was EARLY ACCESS and alot of work in front of us. Overall, i enjoyed this game the best i could.CONS: Now, take everything i said, and play this buggy and unfinished game as a FULL RELEASE. Not sure when, but they chose the money way and hurry up releases that weren't ready instead of making the game as it should.I will avoid the game until i'm sure its a FINISHED GAME and one that doesn't crash and desync like a incomplete game.
MadMatt	Not Recommended	506.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MadMatt14/	Honestly, I'm sad to see a game I once had such high hopes for go downhill now.

This used to be a game I loved hopping on with friends, but now issues with lag and crashes have left it barely played.

Verdoc	Not Recommended	396.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/verdoc109/	EDIT 09/20/18 GO PLAY TENCENT'S (THEY OWN BLUEHOLE) NEW BR GAME RING OF ELYSIUM ITS WHAT PUBG SHOULD BEEDIT 1/1/18 Servers are back to being a mess of constant rubberbanding and the hackers are out in force.EDIT 12/27/2017 I've decided if i cant escape the chinese invaders on the NA servers ill become the invader on the Asia servers, suprisingly theres less of those hackers yelling Chinese at me on the asian servers than there is on the NA servers. Weird.EDIT 12/23/17 So the hackers screaming languages i do not speak have found me on the NA server so that was very short lived its a shame that player unknown himself has said restricing access to servers based on your ip's geographical location (using a vpn would bypass this but render the game unplayable by rocketing their ping even higher) is a "knee jerk reaction" to the hacker influx from china, other than that games running smooth for the most part.EDIT: 12/21/17 The full release of PUBG has surpised me and has addressed alot of the issues i had with its server netcode and performance. i've yet to run into any hackers though so i cant comment on that complaint but so far if it stays the course its going in i can change my review to recommending this game.PRE-RELEASE REVIEW: Servers are garbage and inhabited by nothing by the Chinese who feel the need to hack. Just found out the garbage fire called servers reach a max of 16 hz refresh rate. in comparison csgo has a 60 hz refresh rate which is bashed constantly for being too slow. the optimal refresh rate range is 64 hz to 128 hz, Fortnite battle royale (a free competitor in the battle royale genre) runs at a 20hz tickrate there is no excuse for a 30 dollar game that has micro transactions in the form of loot box keys and the share they get from community market place transactions to start at 3hz and work its way up to 16hz max.
Vigerzz™	Recommended	232.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vigerzz/	Battlegrounds has a lot of issues, but that comes in hand with early access.Its very poorly optimised and has obvious flaws in game but a dedicated and passionate dev team makes the future for Battlegounds look bright.With realistic ballistics and arma style combat this game takes some getting used to.Once into the swing of things its a heap of fun however. Everytime you reach the top 10 there seems to be memorable moments on your journey of survival that really give a sense of enjoyment and fun.This game really builds memories and there are lots of good times that you will take away from it after you stop playing.Pros- Time to kill is sensible- Guns seem fairly balanced- Dedicated developement team- Great gameplay mechanics- Blue Hi Top trainers- Tense and fast paced late gameCons- Optimisation is awful for med to low tier pcs, high frames give a significant advantage in gunfights, laggy cities, game looks terrible on less than high settings- Cars are buggy flip very easily- Loot crates very unrewarding- Armor bit overpowered?- Some games can be boring if you don't see many people- Getting out of cars while moving instakills you at anything over 30kms-  Barely anything apart from doors can be shot through- Submachine guns and pistols are fairly outmatched past the first few circles

addy	Not Recommended	295.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tfuyh/	First of all, I really really want this game to end up being amazing, however right now I simply cannot recommend the game.Let's start with some pros and cons.PROS: Can be fun with friends, and alone. Can really give you that Adrenaline Rush.CONS: Server issues Bullets doesnt seem like they connect sometimes at random. (Google this if you question it.) Performance is still an issue. Dying because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can be extremely frustrating. People are getting banned for killing streamers. People are getting banned for killing team killers. People are getting banned for using the vehicle honk the devs put in the game, if streamers are nearby. Hackers are getting more and more common. (Speed hacking, aimbots, ESP.) In-game ad for Chinese players. Microtransactions in early access is NOT OK. (Please note, these were removed again as they were on a time limit, but still)You'd think they'd be improving performance with time, sure I know its in early access or whatever, but still, when they put "Performance improved" in the patch notes you'd think it was improving.I've got a GTX 1080, 16gb of ram and an i7700k, I used to run the game at 90-120 FPS on 1080p ultra settings. Now its running at anywhere between 45 and 80 depending on my location.... The performance has gotten so much worse.
Nowak	Not Recommended	26.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fuckinggoddamnfurry/	I really want to like this game, but honestly, it left early access way too soon. There's still an incredible amount of bugs, it runs terrible even on a high-end PC (I get about 30 - 45FPS on ultra settings 1920x1080 on an i7-8700K and GTX 1070), there's a huge cheating issue stemming from Chinese players, a lot of things don't work as expected, the netcode is horrendous and RNG is a fickle mistress. Then there's the developers, Blueho- I mean PUBG Corporation, who are way too lost in the game's popularity; they hosted an eSports event for the game when it was in beta, far from being ready for a competitive event (and therefore full of bugs and exploits that gave players an unfair advantage), would rather ban you for finding a bug and demonstrating how it works than, y'know, fixing it and want PUBG to be the only game in the battle royale genre, threatening legal action against Epic Games over Fortnite: Battle Royale (even though PUBG is far from the most thematically- and aesthetically-original game). The only really truly positive things I can say about the game are the gunplay feels really good and clearly shows the developers did their research, and it can be fun if you play with friends. Overall tho, I can't recommend this game full price. Get it on sale if you want it, but I can't really recommend it, especially not in its current state.
Aemilius	Not Recommended	259.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aemiliu5/	This game has a great premise and is actually fun to play, preferably with a couple of friends....When it works.The issues that plague this game include but are not limited to: buildings not appearing on certain graphics cards, inability to reconnect to a game if you get disconnected, servers that barely work (and that sometimes downright fail, kicking you out of the game), horrible optimization forcing you to play on Low graphics even if you've got a decent graphics card.I hope it gets out of Early Access soon with all those problems fixed, otherwise I can't recommend it.And come on, for a studio that's had a gross revenue of about $500 million, fixing all these issues should be child's play. Buy more/better servers, get more staff (especially programmers) and avoid shady tactics like those ads you placed on China's players. (really? $500 million isn't enough?)

Can really give you that Adrenaline Rush.CONS: Server issues Bullets doesnt seem like they connect sometimes at random. (Google this if you question it.) Performance is still an issue. Dying because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t can be extremely frustrating. People are getting banned for killing streamers. People are getting banned for killing team killers. People are getting banned for using the vehicle honk the devs put in the game, if streamers are nearby. Hackers are getting more and more common. (Speed hacking, aimbots, ESP.) In-game ad for Chinese players. Microtransactions in early access is NOT OK. (Please note, these were removed again as they were on a time limit, but still)You'd think they'd be improving performance with time, sure I know its in early access or whatever, but still, when they put "Performance improved" in the patch notes you'd think it was improving.I've got a GTX 1080, 16gb of ram and an i7700k, I used to run the game at 90-120 FPS on 1080p ultra settings. Now its running at anywhere between 45 and 80 depending on my location.... The performance has gotten so much worse.
CustomerChai...	Not Recommended	398.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/z30n/	Garbage game.If you’ve resisted buying this so far, you’ve got the right approach. Don’t even think about spending a dime on this when Fortnite and H1Z1 are free. THIS should be free.Terrible performance across the board — no one I know can run this poorly-made POS without a hitch, and the cheap low-tick-rate servers just make things worse. Designed and programmed by amateurs — even the ♥♥♥♥ing menus stop working every few matches. There’s literally a “Reload UI” button because this happens so often. Pathetic.Dev team focuses on monetization before optimization — usually publishers get blamed for this, but “indies” get greedy too. “Boy, new guns and anti-cheat measures would be cool, but what I really want are some more cosmetic items,” said no one ever. It’s nice that you can just sell them on the Steam marketplace, but both GabeN and PlayerUnknown take a cut of all those transactions too. They’ve probably made billions just on marketplace fees alone, but the only way you’ll see anything more than a few pennies is if you buy a $2.50 key for the super special crates (spoiler alert: you’ll get an item worth less than a dollar). It’s not worth it. Loot crates are a cancer and must be stopped.The replay and spectate features are completely broken. It’s insane that they would try to make this into an esport before refining them. Even the “players left alive” counter, one of the most important features of the game, can be incorrect. The incompetence is mind-blowing.But the worst thing by far is the hackers. If you were playing Battlefield or COD and someone was hacking, you’d know immediately by looking at the scoreboard or the kill cam, at which point you would hop onto a different server. You won’t know it in this game until it’s too late. With the aforementioned ability to make real money off the in-game items and crates, the motivation for hacking becomes obvious and unavoidable. The devs’ greed is literally and directly encouraging people to hack. It’s a win-win for all parties... unless you just want to play games for fun. But who does that anymore?You will find fun moments here occasionally. You’ll make spectacular, satisfying shots to win matches and you’ll feel like you’re on top of the world, but those moments are fleeting and you’ll have little to show for it. More often than not, hackers or technical issues will ruin your fun. At PUBG’s core is a good game concept, but it’s buried under a mountain of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Do not buy this.

Probably one of the bigger issues, battleye isn't working well enough to fix the flow of new cheaters coming ingame. When I started playing in june, cheaters weren't an issue.-Slow update time.-Servers are unstable as hell.-Weapons feel unbalance in my opinion, bullet drop feels a bit unrealistic.-Devs promised no MTX, but we got them.Final verdict 3/10I'd wait until PC release 1.0 comes out to see if the game has improved at all.

MJL	Not Recommended	179.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MJLgaming/	The Death of PUBGLet alone having all Asian players in every match that kill you, this game has a huge problem as of today. I purchased a crate only to have it want me to buy a key for $2.50 to open that crate that I BOUGHT WITH BP I EARNED. I am not putting hard work and time into a game only to be rewarded with a crate you want me to open my wallet to unlock. I thought PUBG was made by people who didn't care about being money hungry, hence the cheaper price tag but it has now become a classic case of bait and switch with the implementation of paid crates, an idea that is getting really old in the gaming community. I will not support any company who is so greedy for money they do something like this obviously despite players wishes. You have already made so much money from selling the game even though it is cheaper than most other games this is just the real creators of the game exposing their greedy nature at the taste of cash. Are you deliberately trying to ruin this game? Have you not been paying attention to current events and what has happened with EA trying to implement RNG gambling into their game? I have always been a huge fan of PUBG and recommended it to every friend (but no longer) and spent countless hours playing but I (along with other players who are against this) will not play another second of the game until this is fixed. I urge all players to stop playing so PUBG will know we do not stand for RNG bull♥♥♥♥♥♥or PUBG will just become greedier for money and you will see the results.

That's about all the positive i can give it though. This game has 100s of bugs and A cheat problem the likes i've never seen before (fueled by the fact that some of the rare cosmetic item can sell for 600+ dollars). When you enter the map you either A. get stuck in you parachute, while other player run around trying to get a weapon, looking like a pinata or B. land get a gun and go about your buisness with the game just to get kill down the road by an ESP+Aimbot hacker. Not to mention all servers have ping issues that can get you killed becuase the developer will not apply a ping lock to the game. One of the developers also called the people who want that xenophobic. Between the hackers and the game breaking bugs this game will be dead soon. (seriously every 2 out of 3 games I see aimboting no recoil on my death cam.)

But if you enjoy spending money for loveless skins, love lagging and desyncs, cheer for FPS-drops and bugs all over the place, PUBG might be a good pick for you. As they were unable to fix those issues within the last year, but constantly pushing monetizing cosmetics, I'd guess that everything bad will stay that way and you can enjoy it as long as you can bear it.

Akib	Recommended	440.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/akib_jawad/	PLAYERUNKOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSBefore buying pubg, I added and removed it from my wishlist several times. Then I came to a decision, I thought why not give it a try. Besides, refund option is always there.Now after playing 105 hours, I am writing this review. So u know that I haven't refunded it yet. This game is worth every penny. Don't know why people compare it with Fortnite Battle Royale. That's so lame. pubg is in early access, so it has some bugs, no need to create chaos for that.Gameplay:Gameplay is realistic, No respawn. Just 1 life. That's what makes the game challenging.Graphics:Overall graphics is nice, as an early access game it has some optimization and bugs. That's not a big deal, it will be fixed when the full version will be released.Movement/Character:You can customize your character when you first play the game. You can play as both First_person and 3rd_person.Playerbase:Pubg was released this year (Early access). The developers didn't know that it will be on the top crossing Dota 2 and CSGO.Money_earning_system?:There are two types of crates. Survivor and wanderer. Price of survivor crates is higher than wanderer, around 0.80. When u play each match u get BP-Battlepoints which u can spend to get these crates. There is also a special crate which is available for a limited time. That is Gamescom Crate, it needs a key to open which costs $3. If u are lucky enough you can get a rare item.(It's all about luck) believe it or not ,i have earned more than around $45 :)Overall:Pubg is an early access game. The last version of the game will be much better, besides, new Desert map and weapons, vehicles are also coming.Don't care what other gamers say, few gamers in my friendlist wrote negative reviews about this game without even playing for 5min. It's because their config can't run this game :)I highly recommend this game. You will get a nice feeling when you play it with your buddies. Addictive Game.Wait!!,- One more thing:Over 20 Million Players-PUBG2017'S MOST PLAYED GAME ON STEAM-PUBGOver 2 Billion Hours Played-PUBG 
Varanae	Not Recommended	19.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Varanae/	Another Early Access game that started promising but ends up with the devs going back on their word. This time in regards to microtransactions.What's to say they won't lie about other more important stuff? I can't recommend the game without knowing the answer to that.
Corey	Recommended	83.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsoraven/	Australian servers are here!The Good:- Great graphics- Pvp combat is responsive and balanced- Variety of weapons, attatchments, armour and health pickups, vehicles too- Devs that listen to the community feedbackThe Bad:- Typical bugs and glitches you'd expect from an early access game (e.g menu freezing after game)- The target area is a bit annoying, it's hard to focus on killing when you're too busy trying to make it into the target area and not automatically killed within the time limit- Half of the time i recieve reward points they arent even credited to my account. Purchased the first crate for 700 coins and did not even receive my items.Recommendations:- Maybe introduce other modes and/ or smaller areas on the map? E.g Close quarters?All in all, this game has great potential and is off to a great start. I'm excited to see what the devs have in store for us

KyoteX99	Recommended	46.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KyoteX99/	So first of all, if you think this game is exactly as H1Z1 you're wrong, this game is so better. Why it is better is because the game is more realistic then the most Battleroyal game's out there. I liked Arma 3, and DayZ back in the days, in my world I would say that this game is like Arma 3 + DayZ + Battleroyal. The only problem with the game is the bad optimization + Glitches. I hope they will work more on this in the future. But at all, It's a fun game. It's worth buying it in my opinion!

Sib3riX	Not Recommended	1,099.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/siberix/	First this is the best battle royale game on market. This is mix between ARMA & H1Z1. Game is optimized for Nvidia GPU at least i saw some benchamarks on internet. This game has less bugs then H1Z1 on release date, and also less laggy.  Im enjoying most of the time in this game but sometimes game will troll you with loot, red zones and blue zones. After all i want to mention this game had fastest fixes ive seen in early access game. Battlegrounds had 4-5 patches so far they manage to fix more fps and bug problems then H1Z1 (Daybrake) in 2 years. I hope this game wont go skin fiesta like H1Z1. For people that run older computers and still want to playFriend from my town is playing this game on intel i530 and gtx 750TI 2gb VRAM and running 45-60 fps on 1080p (this is with current patch but old patches and game he had like 10-20 fps). Also he has problem in big towns with this gpu because of rendering!I do recommend this game because its fun and awesome to play. This is not review just my opinon about game in current state.Update: 03/08/2017Microtransactions in early acess game like h1z1. They will focus on milking money insted of fixing♥♥♥♥♥♥in game. Same happend with h1z1 (skin fiesta people stopped playing etc...). Seems every company is doing what Valve does with csgo (slot machine in game). Big patch #4 is trash.

This is the most disgusting patch ive seen in my life. First they increased desync and ping, added "anticheat" enable or disable LMAO. After so many months they are unable to deal with cheaters in TPP and FPP. Every second or thrid game you die to cheater. Queue time is insane for EU in night time to find TPP or FPP match 5+ minutes waiting. If you love to play Battle Royale game just go to Fortnite for TPP, Blackout and BFV for FPP. Cheaters were active in December 2017 and January 2018 then they started to do smth i didnt get a cheater in match for good 7 months and now they are back in Patch 22. Well i hope Chinese and Russians destory this game because you dont deserver nothing else. You grabed so much money and did absolutely nothing just putting crates and farm money for 1 year.Save your money and use it on something else. They dont deserve your hard work money!

λ Vic	Recommended	369.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vicarious_reality/	Battlegrounds (or PUBG) is one of the best multiplayer games you can play right now. To any newcomers who don't know much about the Battle Royale genre, I'd describe it as the twisted lovechild of CSGO and DayZ/ArmA. PUBG works, plays and feels great, and all of the game's mechanics and online systems are just a lot of fun and very deep (with a low skill barrier, but a high skill ceiling). It offers tense gun fights, intense chases and strategic tension that you won't see in any other game - and it also has very fast, fluid matchmaking.The game's in Early Access, but aside from optimization issues, it feels almost like a complete game, with very few bugs and no showstoppers whatsoever. And with much more content on the way, and frequent patches and dev support, Battlegrounds is certainly worth getting, and I would definitely call it a must-have.

Canksilio	Not Recommended	13.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/canksilio/	DO NOT BY THIS GAME. The developers are showing no signs that they care about the community judging by the waves of bad publicity they are creating and they are actively introducing anti-consumer microtransaction systems before the game is even stable, let alone complete. This information was not avaliable when I purchased it, and they actually stated on their official FAQ that they will not be releasing microtransactions until after early access. By purchasing this game, you are encouraging this kind of behaviour and voting with your wallet that you want content to be cut and re-labled as DLC or microtransactions. I myself will be attempting to get a refund on this game, because I would not have bought it if I had known then what I know now.Went back on a promise not to include microtransactions or DLC until after early access: https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6piovx/just_say_no_to_realmoney_keys_keys_and_crates_are/dkpxj7yAre actively preparing to remove features currently in the game and turn them into paid content:https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6ph5xf/looks_like_free_cosmetics_are_going_byebye/

joemauke	Not Recommended	661.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/joemauke/	This game suffers from a myriad of very serious performance issues.  If someone at Unreal didnt warn bluehole that 100 people in this engine was insane, they should have. Also, I think before they started asking for money for this game maybe they should have reached out to the engine provider and tried to work out those issues, and if necessary scaled back the amount of players to a reasonable amount. (seems they are now in a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥contest with Unreal....again, triggered and stupid response to someone making a better version of your game mode)Because so many have purchased this game early and suffered all the seriously unnecessary performance issues, I think they will find that it will more then likely die quickly if their response to issues doesnt match its meteoric rise.  And from what I have seen, I dont see this getting worked out.  Maybe Mr Greene should have went with a known quantity and not some wanna be dev house like bluehole. Dont get me wrong, the game has a lot of potential, but just like most indie-mod gone pro games, their lack of pro dev experience is showing.  Both with how they handle the public, and their users. Someone will make a game just like this minus the performance issues and PU will just be a foot note.  No one remembers who was first, just who was best.
Spread 'Em Cheeks	Not Recommended	160.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125777922/	The game is quite fun, especially when playing with a friend, or friends. Yes; the game can be boring if you are new and don't know good spots to drop at. The constant 'loot then die' experience is definetely something I feel the Devs should work on by adding new game modes, and allowing FULL custom game sandbox configuration.The reason I have to give this game a negative review is because of the poor business practices of the developers. People are getting unfairly banned because whiney streamers call anyone who kills them a "stream-sniper." While stream sniping can be a huge issue and ruin a players experience; a majority of the time it's just the streamer saying♥♥♥♥♥♥to not look bad.

I first want to say to the Dev's Thank you so much for bringing Battle Royal to us gamers. Millions of us had never heard of it or dreamed of it. Thank you for that. But... And i do mean BUT!!!!  It's been years now and the desync is getting worse. I die so much without seeing my killer only to see him run around the corner to look my body that is 5 feet away. I'm truely sad that after all this time nothing has changed. New maps yay, New weapons yay, New I don't care!!!!!! I am finally uninstalling this game and i hope to never return, I'm sure i will because i hate fortnite and i hate Call of duty. But i will uninstall again. Because i have lost faith that you will ever find out how to get Desync to a reasonable level. This is maybe the saddest review i've ever writen. normally i'm just mad but right now i'm just disappointed in knowing that Pubg will never be what we all hoped. A great BR game that fixed it's issues. Instead just another broken game that spent to much time trying to push loot boxes down customers throats.

Will update later if anything new happens.Tencent is distributing the keys to internet caffe dirt cheap. Rather then using them, they do blackmarket selling for 2$ to players who then create tons of steam accounts and validate them with virtual phone numbers and wait 15 days till they arent trade banned. Then those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s swarming pubg with cheats to farm BP for crates that are then sold for paypal money. Just based on this they can make lots of money and the whole game is totally filled with chinese cheaters even on EU/NA servers. Every 2nd game I encounter a cheater or a macro user.Just dont buy this game until this is solved. Screw u tencent and go to hell.

Of course they didn't!The game is buggy, Personally I could often see through the buildings.Nice cheating without actual cheats. -.-The sounds are horrible.The movements are wonky.The weapons are crap.Many cheaters.People randomly getting banned for absurd reasons.Laggy servers... I can go on and on about why I think this game sucks!I don't understand why it's so popular and I can't wait till the game dies completely.Sorry, but I don't have much  positive to say about this game.The only thing I like about it is that it's an easy game to play with friends.You don't have a rank that you can loose.

I used to think Fortnite was a garbage kid's game and PUBG was far superior, but actions by the devs (or lack thereof on Bluehole's part) shows that Epic cares about you as a consumer, and Bluehole is just looking to make a quick buck at the expense of their playerbase. There's a reason Fortnite overtook PUBG's throne, and it's not because Fortnite is free.Bluehole is truly incompetent.

LOOK NO FURTHER THAN THIS!I've played this game for a long time in early access and it has been a lot of fun. In early access it can be sometimes even funny to have stupid bugs and laggy servers that crash occasionally; it's all part of the deal essentially.

Kenichi	Recommended	223.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKenichi/	I'll preface this review by saying Battlegrounds by no means complete nor well-optimized in it's current state. However, that does not mean it is unenjoyable or unplayable. Despite my short amount of time in-game, I can confidently say is much better than it's counterpart, H1Z1 King of the Kill for a number of reasons:1. Its weapon variety is much healthier and (somewhat) balanced in customability, strengths and weaknesses (and will evidently grow in number).2. Some central mechanics of the game are much more realistic and less buggy in comparison to its counterpart (you can't jump out of cars that are flying at the speed of light and live; weapons actually hit where you aim, at least along the vertical axis - bullet drop is a thing!). 3. There are tons of servers already, and they are more often than not at least playable (I've only had one account of having to leave the game due to horrendous lag).4. Graphically, it's a beautiful game at its highest settings, although it is nearly impossible to play with said settings effectively due to poor optimization, and thus FPS issues/inconsistencies.5. The Steam Market already includes the game's in-game skins and items available to characters; another thing worth noting here is that it's relatively easy to earn "Reward Points" from simply playing the game. With this, you can gradually purchase crates which will randomly drop said skins.6. The game actually feels fun and fair to play. There are a minute number of instances that feel like I was killed due to poor game design or exploitations. Again, this game is by no means complete or the absolute best thing I've played thus far, but it's shaping up to be extremely promising. The Battle Royale in the Arma series were extremely fun, but just a little too slow-paced it seemed; H1Z1 had and has a number of problems that are fundamental to a game's success and playability; Battlegrounds appears to be setting a new standard in battle royale-type games.
Sir_CharlesVonBurger	Not Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198299643299/	Biggest turn off for me is that to do well you have to crank the graphics way, way, way down. On a bunch of occassions I would be hiding motionless in tall grass or a super dark shaddow and someone 100m+ away would spot me and pick me off really quickly. It made me scratch my head since on my screen I was virtually invisible. I tried turning my settings down and then I realized on low settings the darkness contrast between shaddow and direct sunlight is near zero - about 90-95% of the foliage and grass disappears - character models are super distinct against in game objects - low render distance means that character models still render at max distance, but all of their visual cover disappears (you can literally look through trees, bushes, and grass. It's like having a wall hack turned on). In summation - it's a really cool game, but I am not interested in playing with potato quality graphics. I didn't buy a PC so I could play games that look worse than last gen consoles.

Pyroquin	Not Recommended	124.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pyroquin/	PUBG started off as an enjoyable, yet glitchy, experience. Novel in its approach, PUBG allowed people to enjoy the game in a few different ways until the matches reached their apex of tension with the ever shrinking circle of death. In the end, only one person could survive, being crowned with the phrase "WINNER WINNER CHICKEN DINNER!". But, for all of the novelty of this game the actual fun of the game quickly decreased only to be replaced with the frustration of a buggy system, a increasing amount of cheaters, and a cash grab for cosmetics. Having reached over 50 million sales, it is quite amazing that BlueHole would have felt the necessity to institute a pay for cosmetics out of loot crates that you earn from playing the game. What is the point of playing, when only one person can win a game, if the rewards can only be unlocked with real cash? It's certainly not because the game play is top notch.I would have recommended this game, earlier, had they not instituted a pay-to-unlock-rewards policy. Instead of working on a flawed reward system it makes sense that they would have focused on working out the bugs and decreasing cheaters so that the game remains an enjoyable experience. For all of their statements about working out their kinks and combatting a slew of cheating programs, they've accomplished very little actual progress in regards to those goals. Every patch seems to introduce a new level of bugs while hindering performance in some way. These performance drops being explained away as anti-cheat software negatively impacting performance actually show no signs of slowing down the cheaters. In the games before I stopped playing, I had so few matches end because I lost fairly and not because a cheater was shooting out of a car which was halfway across the map and getting headshots even though the player wasn't even aiming. PUBG has one good thing going for it, if not depressing in hindsight, that developers can publish an unpolished game and then reap the benifits of a flawed system that they have no intention of correcting because for every ban they hand out they then receive one more sale.Avoid this game and this developer.

What i want to say though is that in my opinion Greene is a complete moron and i have no respect for him. He fails to realize that most of the people that are complaining about the Chinese playerbase, are not racists but just tired of dealing with cheaters and have valid points for asking to region lock China. Greene was the one who said that around 90% of the cheaters in this game are located in China. If it was the US that was causing 90% of the problem, people would ask to region lock the players located in the US from European servers and visa versa. Calling people xenophobic just because they are westerners when they have very valid points that have nothing to do with race is pretty racist in my opinion. What is really "disgraceful" Greene, is your greed and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ attitude.

Everyone you see getting kills is named something like ZhingZhong666, and when he kills you, you just notice the hack. I even have some video proof of my deathcams..Update for July, 02 2018:Bluehole had previously, in 2016 announced that the game wouldn't have any sorts of in-game purchases such as season passes, and right now, on the store, we see a season pass on sale.I haven't been playing myself, but accompanying streamers on it, and most of the issues I took notice before are still on the game, they do not want to fix anything at all, but keep adding manners to drag money for themselves. Really bad company with a really bad service, if you want to play good battle royale, look for any other that isn't PUBG, for real. it isn't worth it to give them any money at all.

RPG Holding Shark Riding Raptor	Not Recommended	162.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fallen_But_Not_Dead/	Not only has this game questionable gambling mechanics for cosmetic items (aka lootcrates), it's still a hot mess in terms of optimisation, bugs and netcode. This game should still be in early access but they rushed it out so they can release lootcrates without breaking their promise that they won't release lootcrates during early access.And now you also have to pay to play on custom servers, because "they can't provide free servers". So you're telling me, from the $700 million profit you made last year, you can't put even less than 1% of that into servers for custom game modes so everyone can play those? I call BS. Not to mention the fact this could be solved by letting us host our own servers on our PC or renting one, but instead you force it behind a paywall.The developers are milking as much money they can from this hot garbage before it finally starts to lose players to other (and better) BR games. Save your $30- and spend it on a game that actually has competent developers who care about it's playerbase.
Oddface of the wam	Not Recommended	387.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/oddface1/	NOTE: Since this review has been written the amount of hackers I have encountered in-game is at: 27Not only way too many hackers, but I assure you, nearly everygame has a hacker. Playing well? Hacker. Got a care package? Hacker. In final circle? Hacker.Speed hacks, aimbot, 0 recoil, ♥♥♥♥ING HEAT SEEKING BULLETS! All run rampant in this game. Not only hacks but you can choose to play on  ANY  server. This means that (as many people have pointed out)  people (the chinese) take advantage of this, and d-sync to be near impossible to kill, as by the time you get a shot at them they've already killed you.Battleye does absolutely nothing in order to stop hackers. The game may as well be another way to punish yourself as any brief moments of happiness can be instantly taken away by not only the listed points, but also bugs and glitches; motorcycles overturning on a flat surface or vehicles exploding because you ran up against the wrong object.The game needs fixing.

The Chinese are invaded the American servers and the company is calling us racist for it. Also the cash system is useless now considering that they did an update that now you have to buy keys in order to unlock your loot box. Yes, that's right. Now you have to buy real money for virtual keys to unlock your loot boxes when before all you had to do was earn them. Now you have to earn them and pay real money to open them. What I really hate is the lack of optimization and lack of development. This game has sold over 20 million copies. What are they doing with that money? Suing Fortnight for stealing the idea. First of all, this game was inspired by Battle Royale and this is also a genre for the type of gameplay. The devs have no copyright over a genre. I only play this game with friends. I dont play with strangers because you cannot trust them. In it's current state, it's a 6/10 for me.
NekoApocalypse	Not Recommended	224.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125743694/	I BOUGHT THIS GAME FULL PRICE AND YOU GIVE ME IN GAME ADS!!!!!!! SHAME ON YOU BLUEHOLE!!!!For those who do not understand what I'm talking about, I'm a Chinese player and seemingly Bluehole get parterned up with some 'game accelerator' software and put an ad ON THE LOBBY SCREEN. (Basically a VPN software that makes you connect to the game faster)It says 'The only official accelerator of the game'..The ad appears only if you connect from China, so it wouldn't be a problem for players elsewhere, but why did Bluehole even approved this? They are already charging full price for an early access game and now they put ads in it. What kind of developer do this?----------------------------Oct.19--------------------------------UPDATE: Bluehole has ended the partnership with the accelerator software on Oct.5. The ad has been removed since then. Those who accuse me of spreading disinformation, check your sources.Okey, I never expected so many people would be reading this review. I think I should clearify a few things:1. There is no Chinese server. ever. Bluehole tells who is a 'Chinese' player based on his ip. As long as Bluehole saw you as 'Chinese', the ad showed up no matter which server you tried to connect to.(Again, the Ad has been removed so nobody is going to see it anymore)2. It's not all about the Ad, it's about their bussiness model. Instead of fixing their game and their servers, they are already thinking about ways to abuse their popularity for profit. Remember the time when they sold Gamescon Keys?3. What's the hate about? I am just a player who happens to be Chinese. I bought the game and I played fair, so I believe I have the right to complain. I don't want to mention the R word but please do not judge other people by on their nationality or ethnics. btw Bluehole is a Korean (which means, Asian) company.4. I admit 30$ is not a big price given most recent AAA games are selling at 60$ and many have all kinds of season pass & day one dlc & microtransactions kind of stuff. I wouldn't have any problems if they add microtransactions after the game is officially released. But in-game ads really grossed me out. Seriously. This is not a f2p game.Gameplay-wise I totally enjoyed the game, it's the quetionable decision of the developers that prompted me to write this review. The devs are incredible in making this game, but their recent decisions have got me questing their intentions.
Heroin Does Bodies Good	Not Recommended	403.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterSirToot/	I'm gonna join the rest of the community in giving this a thumbs down simply because of the latency between players when one of them has a higher ping than the other.I can NEVER solo queue the game modes Duo, or Squad, and get an English speaking teammate, even one. All of them are always Chinese, and all of them seem to have *NO* idea what push to talk is, and they all seem to have their entire families visiting and talking into the mic the *ENTIRE* game. It's actually pretty frustrating HAVING to queue solo unless I am playing with friends, simply because there is no teamwork involved with (most of) the Chinese community.There are the one in every thousand Chinese players that speak moderately decent english, and do try to help you out. And I feel for those players, but there needs to be something done about splitting the playerbase into their own servers. Apparently it's racist and Xenophobic to think this? Weird because in a lot of other games with multiple regions to queue, you are either locked to your own country's servers, or your ping is way too out of wack to even compete. But, in PUBG, your ping doesn't really affect you in a bad way, and it gives you a huge peekers advantage. Tired of shooting someone twice with a shotgun and getting blood splatters both times just to have him instantly kill me and live with full HP. Whether or not these are cheaters, it's no matter, it shouldn't happen.I get that there always will be interp problems and hitbox issues. CSGO has them, Smite has them, LOTS of games have minor interp problems where something will register on your side but not on the server side, but nothing is nearly as poor as PUBG's conistent hitbox problems.Xenophobic, racist, ChingChongPhobia, call it whatever you want, but there are MULTIPLE issues with players queueing on other servers just to get the peekers advantage. It isn't just "THE CHINESE CHEAT LOCK THEM", it's actually unbalancing the game.I love the game, I play it a lot. I only got it a few weeks ago and Im putting almost 80 hours a week into the game. But, when every two or three games I am either getting killed by a hacker, or trying to queue a game mode solo and getting absolutely no english speaking players *ALL DAY*, it can get really stale.
Tweaker	Not Recommended	34.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tw3ak3r/	Doesnt deserve a 1.0 yet.. Still way to buggy, to many cheaters and to much lag.. Also the Devs are more interested in selling you new Lootboxes instead of fixing the game. Cheaters wont get banned and hacks are normal in this game.. and no one cares.. Devs proudly announced that they banned 1.5 MIllion Account... which is A. not a lot for those sales numbers and B. doesnt solves it the issues.. Every Hacker buys a new account in seconds nowadays...“Battleye have already tweeted out that I think around 99 percent of cheats in the game right now are coming out of China,” said Brendan Greene, PUBG’s creative director, in an interview with Kotaku. - thegamer.com#RegionLockChina

However, if I started smoking a pack of cheap♥♥♥♥♥menthols everyday 20  years ago when I was 5, I still would not have obtained not nearly half the amount of cancer this game has given me in the past 3 months. The damn Chinese are at it again. Every ♥♥♥♥ing game I encounter a Chinese magician from the movie "Wanted" who can defy the laws of physics by curving bullets,  an inventor of guns with no recoil, and even the fastest man alive himself, "Barry Alren". If you are interested in buying this game, I highly encourage that you spend your money elsewhere. Unless of course you like to die to rice eating commies without ever seeing them, maybe they acquired this tactic from the Viet Cong. AMERICA NUMBER ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Finland Doesn't Exist	Not Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JonathanNiemi/	"It's early access, give them a break"No. What Bluehole is doing is flat-out not okay. PUBG started out great with fantastic and useful updates, but what Bluehole has turned it into is an enormous cash grab, using everything in their power to promote the game. Bluehole uses streamers to promote their game, to the point where if you kill a sniper, you get banned. If your game gets bugged and you can't generate structures, you're banned for being able to walk through walls. Bluehole cares more about banning those who play the game well than those who are actually hacking or abusing the system. Also, recently Bluehole has updated the game to include in-game ads. I paid $30 for a game under the impression that things like server lag, game breaking bugs, and hackers would be filtered out over time via consistent updates. What I was given by Bluehole are needless bans, in-game ads, and servers that continue to diminish in quality. Bluehole has had eight months to perform needed server updates, fix current server lag, and rectify major bugs. PUBG's main menu has an option to reload said menu, because Bluehole refuses to fix even minor bugs that ruin its functionality.Bluehole's business ventures are what would reflect that of a Pyramid Scheme if it was a fully finished game. I look forward to seeing how this game progresses, however if these updates continue in the way that they are, I can only say that this game and its developer will die as their beloved streamers become fed up with the quality of content release.Fix your game, Bluehole.
boxer	Not Recommended	62.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HeyGuysItsBrianHere/	Hackers, server lag, client side hit detection, no map selection, no custom server creation tool for non-partners (can't even download a dedicated server tool to host yourself), low tickrate, microtransactions, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vehicle physics, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parachuting mechanics, no max ping (lot of laggers), teamers, and so many more literally gamebreaking bugs, missing features, or just general problems. The release of 1.0 was a cash grab for the Winter sale, calling this a complete game is a disgrace but I'll review it like it's the final product if they want to call it a finished product. Anyone looking for a polished game should avoid PlayerUnknown's Battleground.Edit:I have come back as of May 29th, 2018 to add to my review, just to say that many of these issues have not been addressed (they added a map picker, woo hoo), and this game is still not worth the $30 price tag. Bluehole would rather prioritize hiring more employees who can better help them monetize their existing audience through microtransactions, than fix their damn game.

Artemis	Not Recommended	420.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Artemis_Dragmire/	Right now I can't recommend this game. The game IS super fun and addicting. I quite enjoy playing it.However, the game is coded very poorly, and the developers refuse to acknowledge the rampant cheating that is taking place ingame. If you mention cheaters on the official forums, you will get banned and your topic removed. It seems like the developers are giving their tacit permission to cheat in this game, so let me tell you how some of the cheats are being done.First of all, the game tracks bullet trajectories client side. As a result, cheaters can modify the game's memory to remove cover, even entire buildings. While they won't be able to walk through walls doing this, they will be able to shoot through the buildings or rocks you are hiding behind, and kill you when you have no way to retaliate.In addition, there are many cheats out for the game right now that add a player radar, or alter player skins to be highly visible. As a result, the stealth element of the game ends up going out the window. While you may be hidden from anyone playing the game normally, if someone has a mod that makes players hot pink against a drab green background, well, good luck hiding.Related to that, the developers have openly allowed people to modify their game files using shader injectors, which for many people is a way to pretty up the game. However, it's equally easy to use these shader mods to remove key features from the game that add cover and make you harder to spot, such as removing ground foliage, or making the shadows highly saturated or completely nonexistant, giving players the advantage.The devs have outright said this is ok, so they support cheating in their game, and if you don't run third party tools, you will be at a disadvantage.At $30, the game would be a steal if it was fair. Unfortunately, since the developers support cheating, that $30 is wasted if you ever want to be remotely competitive.The latest update claims to have fixed some of the avenues for cheating. I have not played since posting this to test. Plan to play this weekend.No chance to play this weekend really, servers went down. So even if the cheatingi is fixed, the servers are garbage.Update:So some patches have come out for the game. Have put a few more hours into it here and there.Still don't recommend buying the game at its price point. There are some positive changes being made to the game, and the optimization has gotten better. The cheaters are still ever present in Solo, but seem to have died down a bit. I won't remove this review however, for two reasons. 1. It is making people think hard about buying an early access product. This is good. Early access can be a money pit. This one is fairly good for early access, but still suffers from a lot of development issues, and poor community management (see: none at all).The second reason I won't take down this review is because I have received death threats and been otherwise bullied into trying to remove it. I don't know if this is the shady♥♥♥♥♥Korean devs paying people to try and scare off one of their top negative reviews, or just salty fanboys. Maybe a little of both.Either way, I'm not scared, and I've heard ALL the insults before. So keep em coming.Latest update:Cheaters have died down a bit, probably get killed by one 1/6 games or so. Still a problem, and the devs still haven't done anything about it, but reduced because the game's popularity has waned a bit.New hotness though:People teaming in solos or combining two duo teams into a 4-man squad in duos. I'm seeing this now probably 1/3 games. This is another form of cheating, and again, the devs don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥Update 6/30/17 -New patch is out. It's a good one. PUBG has claimed to have banned 25k cheaters, which is good if true. Does kinda shoot the people claiming it's impossible to cheat and that cheaters are NOT a problem right in the face though, doesn't it? Played some of the patch last night, it's feeling much more optimized and they have improved the performance a lot. However, due to the popularity of this patch, and the devs bragging about banning cheaters, cheaters are even more popular right now than I've seen in a long time. Probably about 1 out of 2 games has a cheater in them (in duos mostly right now, haven't played squad or solo much recently).

toM	Recommended	694.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ReefHD/	I've never wrote a review, because mostly I'm lazy. So that says something to start with. Having never played a game like this, all I can say is amazing. Yes there are a few hiccups, but that's expected from an EA game. Give it a few weeks / months to iron out some of the "bigger" issues (buggy parachute landing as an example, lag in the first 20 secs as everything spawns in), and its going to get even better. As long as the dev's dont go off the road with stupid ideas, or implements into the game and keep its CORE values it's only going to get better. They are really listening to the community and are already constantly publishing updates to stabalise and optimise their servers. Over time this will only improve. They have already stated they want to introduce vaulting which will make the experience far more fluid.Personally if you are in the middle of the road to buy this game like I was, bite the bullet. You won't be disappointed (but I do have a few friends to play with which to me really enhances the game even more, with tactics and so on.) Took a few games to get the "hang" of it.Otherwise just follow on reddit or twitter to see for content updates. Again, personally as long as devs dont go "over the top" in the future and keep focused on the current play style. For me its a high 7/10.

William_bug	Not Recommended	42.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198234975520/	Let me tell you 1.why PUBG experienced a lot negative reviewes in these days and 2.why I give a negative review for this game. 1. Most negative reviews in these days were given by Chinese players. PUBG published an in-game advertisement of a third-party gaming VPN for them. This is the first time I saw an third-party advertisement in a “Non-F2P” game. Of cause this is not the worst part. The worst part is, after the new patch update, most of Chinese players cannot connect to the server like before. Renting that gaming VPN seems to be the only choice for them to play this game. So, it is obvious that PUBG limited the players who have already paid for this game to connect to the server and discriminates all Chinese players. That gaming VPN also increase rent fees after they publish the advertisement in the game. 2. From my perspective, this game is a fun game, but it is not a great game. You can have fun here, but you can not “research” or “go deep”. The high randomness of this game highly decreases the competitiveness which is not helpful for long term development of a game. The optimization is also a huge problem. After the new update, I experienced a high FPS drop. Server also became unstable. The advantage of a high-end pc also became more and more obvious. Although each gameplay is different, I also feel boring sometime because the weakness in player-player interaction. Two situation I mostly encountered are ambushing an enemy and geting killed by hide enemies. Hence, I don’t recommend this game for competitive players and the players who would like to “research” and “master” the game. If you just want to have some fun or play with your friends, this game is also a fair choice for you. However, Please aware that PUBG will not consider your interest as a player since they just sold their Chinese player community to a third-party gaming vpn and force them to buy this vpn.

SomeGuyNamedTom	Not Recommended	42.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SomeGuyNamedTom/	EDIT: PUBG has filed a suit against Epic Games to "protect their copyright". These developers are immature to think that Fortnite is a direct copy of PUBG and that they would win with games such as H1Z1 and Black Ops 4 out there as well.TL;DR This game had potential, but it is not worth the money anymore.It started off as one of the best battle royale games, putting to shame H1Z1 or ARK. Early access, it was obviously unready, but it was still fun to play and there were no microtransactions. It was hard to run, but the potential for the game was high. So much could have been done to improve it and make it a competitor for AAA games.But then the devs got greedy and made it into a money farm. The game came out in December of 2017 and still today is very unoptimized. I see that there are indeed new game modes and maps to try and combat this, but it is too little too late. This game in its current engine will most likely never reach a level of optimization that is acceptable for the amount of time that has past since the launch date. With the introduction of loot boxes, this game has just become a cash grab. Not to mention that since it has been on the Steam store, it has never gone on sale.Overall, it was fun in the beginning, but the disrespect from developers to consumers with the introduction of microtransactions has sent this game towards its grave.P.S - Don't even get me started on the whole cheating situation. That is another conversation.

HELL NO, U PREFERED TO REDUSE THE POINTS EVERY PLAYER GETS AFTER EVERY GAME CAUSE YOU ARE UNABLE TO DO SOMETHING WITH THESE BOTTERS U RUIN WHOLE COMMUNITY,RLY BAD MOVE FROM COMPANY SIDE.5.Add new attacments and give 2 keys at 1000 random ppl who write their oppinion on your survey, YOU EARNED MILLIONS IN 1 YEAR AND U REWARD YOUR COMMUNITY WITH 2000 KEYS,something is going wrong in this company, for example Fortnite had 1 day problem with their servers and gave to all players free cosmetics as reward for the waiting,PUBG have problems from they day they released it.6.They saw that their game started to loose people because other battle royal games released, and what they did? maybe add something that the others games dont have? OF COURSE NO, THEY JUST COPYCAT FEATURES FROM THE OTHER GAMES.7.Bluehole gave private servers only at some youtubers and streamers at the start of the early access, nothing rly changed untill today.NOT EVEN PUT AN OPTION FOR EVERY PLAYER TO TEST THE WEAPONS WITHOUT JOIN A GAME.8.And for last YOU MAKE TRADE LOCK! ok some ppl will say its for the gambling sites etc.Everyone who have IQ over 50 knows that these gambling sites are scam,and the 3rd party sites where u can cashout your money i rly dont see anything wrong with that(these sites is the reason these games have so big communities) so don't be fooled by bluehole's words.Every item u sell on steam market,steam take 15% from the transaction, from the 15% the company that owns the game in our case Bluehole earn 7,5% so ask yourself ARE THEY RLY DO THAT TRADE LOCK CAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT THE COMMUNITY? (Personaly i have earned over 150euro from pubg items and i think this is not bad,not all kids these days have money to buy new games etc, trading and selling skins was a way to earn some money and buy what they want.)PS. All i wrote is my personal view about the company and the game =]UPDATE: Now they announced EVENT PASS , oh mate i rly laugh with the developers, i have to say 3 things about this:1.Items will be not marketable.........2.You gain 2xp every 5 mins online in a game, THEY TRY TO MAKE THE NUMBER OF ONLINE PLAYERS BIG AGAIN FOR THIS DEAD GAME WITH THAT BAIT.3.See how much developers care about you the community at this post https://steamcommunity.com/games/578080/announcements/detail/3077529898698894565https://imgur.com/a/ulvE5tN here is what the developer wrote if u are bored to look at comments !

Apart from servers, the game runs very well on my mid range system (FX 8350 and GTX 1060) i can get 50+fps alot of the time on high settings. Coming from 1000+ hours on arma 3 the combat is extremely satisfying and very smooth, definitely a key part of this game and for its current state its actually really well done. Highly reccomend!

From infinite loading screen bugs, to meshes/textures not loading in allowing you or whoever is having it to be allowed to shoot through the walls, and countless other bugs/problems. Yet they are calling this an official release? * Massive amounts of hackers. Ever since they sold out to the chinese, the game has been over ridden with hackers, and these hackers are not just sticking to the chinese servers. NA, SEA, EU, RU doesn't matter. 2 days ago 60% of our games we died by hackers with aimbots shooting full automatic 600m away and headshotting us instantly out of vehicles. The next day we played only 4 games, and 3 of them had hackers who killed us. Today as of writing this, again out of 7 games, the majority had hackers who killed us. I've never had this issue or complaint with this game ever before, even back when hackers were supposedly a big issue, I never saw them, but their are so many of them now, its a miracle if you dont get one in your game. --------------Selling out to the chinese, and putting this game under the chinese developers ultimately just signed thsi games death warrent. Supposedly banned 1.3 MILLION hackers, that alone says there's  ahacking problem, but when they ban that many and you STILL get a vast majority of your games with hackers? just move onto a diff game.

I would strongly suggest refraining from buying this until the cheating is addressed by Bluehole. I've had 4/5 of the last games I've played ended by aimbotters, speedhackers or being shot through walls. It's unplayable almost.

$onic_0	Not Recommended	232.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sonic1313/	Only a few weeks ago the developers finally decided to add a map selection where you could choose between the pretty popular classic map (Erangel) and the not so liked desert map (Miramar). So finally players like my friends and myself would not have to always leave the game when they randomly landed on a Miramar lobby. This can be a real pain when you are unlucky and you get thrown on Miramar multiple times in a row. Especially if you keep in mind that even if you start on Erangel you always have to wait for 60 seconds until the game starts. All in all you could have a waiting time of around 5 minutes before you finally start a game on your desired map. And if you are unlucky or unskilled it could already be over after a couple of seconds again and the whole process starts again. So ye we were really happy after the great news 'Map Selecion is implemented'. Today only a couple of weeks later they removed the map selection again. But why?According to some interview footage I've found it is because of the queue waiting time of Miramar. They say it would be too long since it is so unpopular and players would not play it anymore. A logical conclusion to this would be to either remove the unloved Miramar or seperate the players so the small Miramar fan group could still meet up and play their map while the majority of players can enjoy Erangel or even the new map Sanhok. The developers however decided to go for a really "smart move". Why not force the majority of players to play a map which is unliked by most of them? Ye thats what they actually did! You can now choose between randomly landing on Miramar or Erangel again or/and pick the new map Sanhok. So again if you do not like Miramar but Erangel you have to leave the lobby over and over again. Great idea Blue Hole! Developers should definetely force players to play something they do not want to. That makes the experience great. So my friends and I decided to not play PUBG any longer until one day maybe map selection will be back. Until then lets keep spamming their update news commentary section again with the good old spam we used before map selection got implemented for the first time.░█▀▀█ ░█▀▀▄ ░█▀▀▄ 　 ░█▀▄▀█ ─█▀▀█ ░█▀▀█ 　░█▄▄█ ░█─░█ ░█─░█ 　 ░█░█░█ ░█▄▄█ ░█▄▄█ 　░█─░█ ░█▄▄▀ ░█▄▄▀ 　 ░█──░█ ░█─░█ ░█─── 　░█▀▀▀█ ░█▀▀▀ ░█─── ░█▀▀▀ ░█▀▀█ ▀▀█▀▀ ▀█▀ ░█▀▀▀█ ░█▄─░█─▀▀▀▄▄ ░█▀▀▀ ░█─── ░█▀▀▀ ░█─── ─░█── ░█─ ░█──░█ ░█░█░█░█▄▄▄█ ░█▄▄▄ ░█▄▄█ ░█▄▄▄ ░█▄▄█ ─░█── ▄█▄ ░█▄▄▄█ ░█──▀█ Cheers

Even sat at traffic lights in your car, you never want the car who pulls up next to you to beat you off the line.Battlegrounds is a game that has found meteoric success over the last few months attracting millions of bloodthirsty players ready to fight to the death, but not all of them want to play by the rules. Depending on who you ask PUBG either has a serious hacking problem that affects every game or cheaters are barely noticeable, rare unicorns witnessed every one hundred games or so. Whichever side of the fence you sit on, PUBG has banned roughly tens of thousands of hackers in the last three months, so they're certainly out there. You may very well have played with a hacker, but the truth is you'd never know it, if the hacker slowly stalked you using ESP, an ability that grants the cheater extra sensory perception of your location at all times. You'd just think you were unlucky. You can't win every game after all.Hacking communities are notoriously secretive and for obvious reasons, but this often leaves their motives shrouded in stereotypes. Common opinion paints them as vindictive children with too much time on their hands and a penchant for mischief, but surely they can't all be like that? Some of these hacks aren't cheap. So back to the game....FPP or TPP?My opinion on FPP vs. TPP: First off I prefer FPP over TPP. When it comes to watching I prefer, to watch FPP. The reason being is gameplay is more exciting. You can play more aggressively, higher kill games are more common. Gun skill becomes more a factor. People have to take risk to gain information in FPP, you can't just sit behind your cover and see everything that is happening around you. You have to understand when to peek, what directions to be watching. You can snowball fights, If I engage someone in FPP and damage them heavily, they either have to turn to fight me, or retreat to cover. If they retreat to cover they’re now blind to my movements, I can flank them, reposition and attack them from another angle. The enemy player after being caught off guard, or losing the initial engagement has to understand where I can move on him. He either needs to predict my movements, or take a risk to gain information by peeking, and then responding accordingly. If that same scenario happens in TP, as soon as the guy gets to cover he is safe. He can med, he can see all my movements, I can't push him. It becomes a stalemate. Whoever moves first more often than not will die in this situation. Gameplay is slowed down, and aggression is halted. There's way more action in FPP that's why I prefer watching it. There's a ton of game sense that comes into play in first. Since you don't have some camera floating up behind your character, with a super wide FOV. When it comes to what one is more skilled, both require a large amount of skill to do really well in at the highest level. At the end of the day when it comes to the more skilled mode, I have to give it to FPP though.

iVi	Not Recommended	202.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/speedfigure/	Broken/Flawed Game, Useless DevsPUBG is fundamentally broken and hobbled. The game is quite seriously unplayable by any modern standard. The number of active players has been dropping like an anchor, and with many good reasons. Do not buy this game. PUBG's devs have done nothing about any of the game's numerous issues except push out cash-grab cosmetics and quasi-gambling loot boxes, while doing the bare minimum to retain their cash-cow community's involvement without fixing any of PUBG's numerous issues. The devs do not care about the community, they are unable to keep their word, they don't care about the game running at a bare-minimum level of performance, and are either unable or unwilling to fix any of these issues, if not both. I personally have played essentially 200 hours, and this game is absolute garbage, run by a bumbling team of inept idiots who are seemingly incapable of doing anything right or even holding true to their word or their community. To explain:With top-of-the-line hardware, the game is unable to consistently maintain triple-digit frame rates or even hit them at all on the lowest settings. The game's performance is abysmal, and the devs who have had more than a year to fix the issues have offered nary a peep or solution apart from the empty "we're looking into it" message they feed the community. With each update, the game runs slower and choppier. With each update, the frame rates take more and more hits. The lag and desync are abysmal. The connectivity, even when playing on servers that are in one's region, is fraught with the likes of getting killed behind cover multiple seconds after shots are fired and a line of sight has been broken or players stuttering and lagging as they travel which makes killing or even landing shots impossible. Outright disconnection occurs frequently too. The devs, while PUBG was in early access, gave their word that no microtransactions would be added to the game until it left early access. They lied. They reneged on their word, and added paid lootboxes in August of 2017. They have continued to pump out cosmetic items since, all while plaintively bleating that these are done for the good of the game and the cosmetics team is different from the performance and development team. Yet the community sees no performance results from these lying devs, and continues to be exploited for profit. PUBG has refused to region-lock their game, which has led to an overwhelming influx of lagging and hacking players from less-developed countries who exploit the game's poor state of development for their own gain. Their vain attempts at integrating anti-cheat do nothing about the leaderboard infestation of hackers who dominate the top levels of the ranking system. Reporting them does nothing, and PUBG seems either unable or unwilling to do anything (i.e. they are either inept or malicious, if not both). These anti-cheat systems are also tied to the game's ever-decreasing performance from update to update, and yet masses of cheaters remain unaffected by the anti-cheat as evidenced by their clear prevalence in the game's leaderboards. As the final straw, PUBG's devs are so greedy and inane that they have disabled item trading and have even disabled selling of paid cosmetic items on the Steam market in some inept and myopic attempt to control the market in its entirety.

They shoud've concentrated in fixing bugs, not releasing new content that everybody disliked and just added new bugs to the game. They should've stop the chinese hackers. They should've tweaked the rules so watching the game would be enjoyable, not a campers' clash. They've milked the game and now is time to just abandon it. The gaming community gave the same chance that we gave to League of Legends, the thing is that Riot Games took the chance and made something noteworthy with it. This game will remain forever as something that COULD HAVE BEEN great. This game shouldn't be bought nor played by anyone in its current state.

PUBG is an amazing game with a lot of potential; if you’re into First Person Shooters this game should be something you keep in mind. The issue with this game is it's community. Upon entering the game, you will have the ability to create a generic character, select your region (servers) and select from solo, duo or squad based combat. I have played on the North American and European servers, and in most of my solo games, they're have been hackers, some of which are untargetable, have augmented their capabilities or/and have Aim-bots that can shoot passed the fog of war. If you decide to play Duo or Squad base combat, you should either have a pre-made team OR know Mandarin. These are the only two ways you will be able to communicate with your team effectively. As most of the players in both the North American and European servers are Mandarin speakers from China. If the language barrier and  the hackers aren't an issue for your playstyle, prepared to be shot in the back or killed, by a teammate because you’re not Chinese and they (the other Chinese members of your team) want your loot, this will happen on a NORTH AMERICAN server. I comprehend/speak English, Spanish, French, some Italian and Portuguese, and this is the first time in my 26 years of gaming that I couldn't play a fun game due to language barrier.

-J&A- Valkyrja	Not Recommended	78.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067343516/	EDIT: Here come the microtransactions...Question of the day:Is it really a released game if you can't play it?This game is heartbreakingly eating itself, there are so many good things to be said but so many more bad things at the point of this review. First off, I'd like to say the hardcore and fast pace of Playerunknown's Battlegrounds on ArmA 3 was excellent, but this game is in fact bleeding the playerbase on the mod there into nothingness (which is an honest shame, because its so much better). For a game that claimed to be based with the idea "realistic but fun" in mind, its clear that neither were taken into consideration when creating core game mechanics. The ballistics are in general terrible, penetration, damage to players, and the armor system in totality are just wrong. I suppose to an extent the more casual approach to this in general makes it more playable for some but to me it is ruining. I've on numerous occasions hit people with upwards of 10 rounds from a rifle and since they could just continually heal themselves it meant nothing at all for me. Weapons had somewhat realistic damage but seem to have just fallen apart, and players just end up being bullet sponges no matter what you shoot them with. To put someone down, you need 2 or 3 well placed shots, this in my opinion is perfect, however then they are able to be revived (unless you are playing solo, which in my opinion makes the game barely worth playing with all these other issues the game faces). Worse yet is the fact that throwing on some body armor makes those well placed shots barely count, and the deteroriation of armor is also rather unrealistic, you can be shot in the head with the AWM (a rifle firing .338 Lapua Magnum, a caliber that has literally killed in the real world at distances of over 2 miles) and be revived by your friend. Surely enough a majority of the other guns have been totally ruined in at least one aspect or another, and the aiming system is absolutely horrendous, I don't think I've ever seen a game where to end up having your gun "prone-blocked" is so simple and common.Aside of this the game itself is just pretty bad, hit detection has been awful since the very beginning, the lag is almost a given no matter which server or gametype you try to play, and so much more frustration to be had with the rest of the 'technical' parts of the game. To make things even more fun, they're literally advertising ingame now by replacing textures. Recently I've started seeing objects spawn midgame during extreme cases of lag and the hacker infestation as of recent is unbelievable, almost every match I play you can see one or two people eliminate half of the server in a matter of minutes. Of course it should be of no suprise that the developer cares little to none since they're now literally working alongside the people making and selling the hacks in China. Teleportation, one-hit-kill and long-distance punching, rapid fire cheats, insane numbers of simple wallhack+aimbot users, and allowing the use of cheats that make fog less visibile and players a brighter color, this game has to be the most cheater-ridden game ive ever seen, its simply incredible how many there are. Of course I suppose they only intend to stick to BattlEye for now instead of adding an additional anticheat or even trying to actually keep the cheaters from coming back, since this would be a loss of profit as they wouldn't buy the game again and again. Atop this all, the lead developer, Brendan Greene, is an immature crybaby who thinks that he has some type of ownership of 'all' battle royale games, he doesn't want to accept that his game is terrible and that there will be competition that will wipe it out in the oncoming year(s). He called Fortnite a rushed ripoff of his game, when it couldn't be any less true, he attempted to sue them for developing it, and the worst part is it is not even his concept.There is so much more wrong just with the core game, I'll probably come back and retouch this review with more information but for now it seems that it's just going to fall into the same spiral down the toilet as did so many other games like it, like The War Z and H1Z1 have. It's actually quite sad to see a game that truly restores faith for others that are also dying of non-progress, like DayZ.EDIT: 1.0 UpdateThis game may just slowly make its way to something significant, this update actually really smooths gameplay out but it surely does not fix the entire game, I'll try to keep this updated more but until then vaulting/climbing has finally been added, replays/deathcam, and significantly better gunplay both on a ballistics and damage standpoint, and as long-awaited, actual optimization and graphical improvement is being slipped in as well.EDIT: Completely removed game from my account and I have no regrets whatsoever.

BFG Zyddie	Recommended	1,700.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zyddie/	This game kinda caught me by surprise.Rarely do I write about early access games and the state they are in and VERY rarely do I ever touch a game like this, however 4 friends of mine talked me into testing it out and I`m having a lot of fun.The game itself is poorly optimized beyond words, major FPS drops even on my GTX 980 TI´s but the gameplay is solid, 90-100 people drop off an airplane have fun and be last man/woman standing.The pure thrill of being close to one of the last one surviving or playing hide and seek for 20-30 mins is intense and the gunplay is played very very good, playing with teammates everything from duo to 4-6 people just makes the game a hell of a tactical game, planning where to meet what stuff to pickup and how to help each other the best, it is a game that in it´s current state is gonna be very curious to follow and hopefully they will not ♥♥♥♥ it up like a lot of other types of this game.That being said, the game already paid itself for me due to the drops, I`ve spend 30 bucks on the game and gotten drops for nearly 65 bucks sooo I`m quite okay.I`m therefor strongly recommending the game as it is now even with the bad FPS drops and connection issues you will find now and then it is diffenetly worth the buy and diffenetly worth keeping an eye on for the future.
Lithrem	Not Recommended	300.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141763234/	I've put up with this game for nearly 300 hours of my life. It's a great game, much better than others out there. Well, I guess that would be true if they could actually care about their community. When the game was in early access, it was great. No loot boxes that required keys, no battle passes, not many glaring bug issues which made the game worse. But as time went on, I realized that PUBG doesn't care about its players. All they care about is getting more money. For the life of them, they cannot fix the framerate problems and lag issues. They keep coming out with new maps and new crates which is far from what we need. But with all the money they've gotten in the past year, for some reason they can't fix any of their bugs or lag issues which make most of their players leave. I really love this game and I want it to be successful, but I don't think it will ever be that way. I'm sorry PUBG for giving a bad review, but it has to be done. I'm going to play some Rainbow Six Siege now.

Buy it, try it, and refund if meh."So today's lesson is - you kill each other off till there's only one left. Nothing's against the rules."- Kitano-senseiBattle Royale was my biggest dread throughout my teens. I watched it with friends around the turn of the 20th century, fell in love with it but was convinced that it'd really happen at some point. Mum would ship me off to an island full of murderous youths and I'd never see the light of day. At 5'4" and less than 7 stone, I was scared I might have to pimp myself off to random horny guys so I could slice their necks as they tried to rip my knickers off. Boy was I dark teen. Given that I got so immersed in the idea of dystopian survival you'd reckon I'd have played more survival arena games, but no. This is the first time I've felt like I've found an actual "Battle Royale" game that I enjoy and am excited to play. Despite my freakish intoxication with simulated high stress survival environments, no game has felt like I was "in" Battle Royale. This feels like I'm playing the media franchise. I love it to tiny ripped shreds as I scream with intervals of girly giggling, blood splattered all over my face.Spawning on an island that moonlights as a lobby, population 100, you can practice combat using weapons available at set locations most easily obtained when joining early (±35P). The island has nooks and crannies to explore but most games start within 1-2 minutes of entry thanks to the current massive inflow of players. You can see this lobby/island on the far right corner of your map and actually return there once you start a match if you want. It's really meta... Once the game starts you'll sit in a plane with everyone else and parachute to your area of choice on a much larger island (aka Erangel). You loot buildings and other players (after killing them) for gear/weapons/consumables (buff) and drive all over the island in the process while keeping an eye on the safe zone that exponentially shrinks until there's only one surviving player/team. Get caught outside it too long and your health will plummet quicker than a suicidal anchor.The Vicissitude of Early Access (*EA)Writing about popular games always bears with it the possibility of sounding like a broken record. You already know the negatives, the positives and the performance tribulations from the countless reviews and forum posts. To top it off the game is in EA, each patch bringing along a band of changes voiding the initial points within previous reviews. Transposing from strategy to action, the sub genre is inconstant. In one patch the former glorious ascendancy of strategy was forcefully removed, whittling the mind blowing chessboard it started as down to headstrong tactics only because of a slight shift in quality weapons loot placement and its spawn rate. It's since been revamped with higher percentage of crate drops and loot. The smallest changes make you choose divergent plays from one patch to the next. It went from mostly strategy to mostly twitch shooter in a single patch and then backed up towards a middle ground trying to maintain equilibrium. It might end up less like the initial brilliance of a Battle Royale simulator and more towards another generic arena shooter. Who knows? EA multiplayers are hard to keep alive. Unavoidably awful optimisation reeks of EA, testing the patience of most systems and players. Server side latency is fine but too often it'll fail to sync (what I see on screen = not actually happening). One thing is for certain, I'm having an insane degree of fun playing PUBG, and even if it ends up like every other heap of goo I won't regret it because it's great right the eff now. I bought it at release because it was already a well done game and pretty much complete in terms of gameplay mechanics. All it desperately needs is to get a handle on performance issues and just how system heavy it is.  Running a tight ship exterminating hacks/cheats is a given and they seem to be doing relatively well. PUBG knows no other flaws.It's potently engaging if you favour the tactical twitch shooter, and don't shy away from strategy. It's not solely for genre veterans. If you like the speed of Overwatch but love the tactics of XCOM, you'll be surprised to find yourself appreciating just how much brain power PUBG requires. If you like strategic board games such as chess or Go and FPS games as well, PUBG will ooze allure. It's less intimidating than military tactical shooters like Arma while being more serious than your run-of-the-mill survival arena. Having a blast even if you're not super into positioning and favour the run and gun approach is uncomplicated and doable. Often I'll jump into populated landing points just to have some fast fun shooting, killing and mauling people where everyone is just enjoying the game in an arcadey manner and having a riot. This game can cause uncontrollable laughter (you've been warned). Suffice to say it'll be harder to win without strategy seeing as even a good shot will run out of bullets in a 100P arena eventually. A growing majority of its players are strategic, skilled and smart enough that trolls actually burn out faster and get bored. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. I kid you not, PUBG players are the poster children of this phrase. The median skill level has risen over the past month but it's moderately easy to get into for new players even if you aren't genre familiar. Cheating isn't as prevalent as other similar games. I witnessed a blatant hack only once, nude and gliding across the grass like super speed Jesus... More serious cheats have arisen as of late but generally it's refreshingly vanilla, and is subjected to comparatively infinitesimal griefing thanks to the toil of both devs + community.When picking this up during beta I was looking for something to replace The Division's adrenaline fueled Survival mode. The Division was a rare retreat where I had my fill of 200+ hours and suddenly felt content enough to move on. After that I sat there sucking my thumb wondering what I could do to fill the void. Along came PUBG. The only things I need to worry about here are looting, players, the shrinking field, positioning, endgame + luck. The field isn't as lethal since fatalities only come from my miscalculations and the dexterity of others. Yet PUBG understands the greatness of simplicity and it's wildly entertaining. The realism gauge is pronounced the way jumping from a fast moving vehicle will knock you down. On the other hand, I could ragdoll into oblivion by rolling down a tame hillside riding a motorcycle too fast while being able to survive multi flips of insanity like a gymnastics ribbon aiming for an Olympics gold medal, barely scathed while boosting a Dacia off a steep cliff...If you can master the art of laughing in the face of frame rate issues like a true masochist, you should be playing now rather than later. Needlessly tweaking balance like mad could leave us with Frankenstein's monster and most combat orientated multiplayer EA games on Steam don't prevail due to this. Despite the train wreck performance, it's amazingly fun and I feel like it has made me laugh the most out of any game I've ever played. With EA, people throw around the word "potential" like if you say it enough the game will magically nurture itself from dust. PUBG is what potential actually looks like. It's acceptably tense, wholly satisfying and loads of fun with a mate(s) or alone. Solo is mighty strategic, squad wreaks havoc and duo is the middle child. I feel dead inside when things lag, but again I've had some fantastic matches that made it all better. Also, zero simulation sickness!Tips in comments

2dgamemania	Recommended	36.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2dgamemania/	A dedicated Battle Royale game where you have to win out of about 100 people who usually enter a server.  The circle shrinks and you have to enter the circle and be the last man/woman standing to win.  All the stats are recorded and you can view them in game.  There are solo mode, duos and squad so you can team up if you want.  I havent seen any cheating, such as going through walls etc and there doesnt seem to be many bugs.This game uses the unreal engine 4, graphics for early access are pretty good, in some of the larger towns it struggles alittle on my machine but its early access so plenty of time to fine tune the fps.  The sounds are good, works well with my surround headphones so I can tell where shots are coming from.The developer is well known and I'm confident player unknown and his team will make this game even better than it is already.  My personal opinion is that its more sim than h1z1 but slightly less but not far off from arma3 BR, games seem to be slightly quicker than arma3 br.  I look forward to see this game develop even further :)A solid Battle Royale game , now got to sort out that divorce ;)

[PA] Warrior_-_S.A	Not Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WarriorKSA/	I've had it with all these Chinese and Asian-region players and those who are not part of the North American region overflowing the NA region, with all due respect.  It's not fun and it ruins the gaming experience and defeats the whole purpose of having a coordinated squad to play with if its members only English is shouting 'China Number One!!', although this is subject to a debate, this is none of my concern as a player who looks for a friendly teamwork environment where communication and coordination play key role in determining the game's outcome.  The devs fail to lock people in their respectful regions which results in people joining other regions although they seem to be unable to communicate effectively with those who are native to that region.  I don't care if their region is full of hacks and whatnot, that's that region's problem which they should solve.  It should not have any impact on any other region, nonetheless. This in terms of language barrier.In terms of gameplay, the need for region lock is so essential because without region lock those nonnative players will maintain higher pings which lead to desync disadvantage to those who are region native which results in overall unfair game.I think we as region natives should make it hard for such people to survive and to enjoy being in our region by any means necessary. I didn't vote for Trump, but damn...
Hairy Robbaz	Not Recommended	20.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/robbaz/	This is a good game for someone that just want to drop into the action. It's essentially a dad game or for people that "just want to play".It's suprising how big it gotten with so little content, direction and lack of choice. A lot of games the last years has had a similar problem but PUBG takes the cake and the cake is made only with cream.I can't reccommend this game to anyone that want depth or choice, especially solo play. Duo's or Group can get a lot deeper but it's still not worth it.If you just want to drop into a game, not give a damn and just go ham. This is perfect, without a doubt 100% perfect. I would rate this neutral if i could.
S4ky	Not Recommended	86.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S4W4/	Esta cosa necesita optimizacion U R G E N T ENo es normal que con todo al minimo no me valla a 60fps ESTABLES.Tiempo despues de esa queja por optimizacion actualizo esta review para que sea un poco mas completa, y para explicar los puntos por los cuales creo que este juego es mediocre en comparacion con otros juegos tipo battle royale.- Graficos: El aspecto grafico es algo que no suelo tener en cuenta a la hora de analizar un juego, pero en este juego es algo que llamo mi atencion, y no para bien. Los graficos del juego no son nada disfrutables, al ser un juego enfocado en el realismo pareceria que el aspecto grafico podria tener una alta prioridad, pero no.- Jugabilidad: Al salir las balas directamente del arma y no de la "cabeza" del jugador, en muchas ocaciones te encontraras fallando muchos disparos por algun objeto que tenias en frente del arma.- Mapas: Los mapas son terrenos de 8x8 quilometros, en el mismo se encuentran vehiculos que facilitan el movimiento por el mismo. El problema entra en que en un lugar tan grande, y con la necesidad de seguir las indicaciones del juego de hacia donde hay que moverse para evitar morir fuera de la zona de juego, es facil estar caminando minutos y minutos para llegar y encontrarte con alguien afortunado que no tenia la necesidad de moverse mucho, ya que la zona segura quedo encima de el. Habiendo gastado tiempo de juego en caminar derecho hasta encontrarte con tu muerte, lo cual me lleva al siguiente punto.- Progreso: En el juego no existe ningun sistema de niveles, ranking, mejoras, ni nada por el estilo, lo unico que podria usar el jugador para presentar progreso en el juego mas alla de la habilidad seria la vestimenta que traiga, cosa que tampoco representa el progreso del jugador, ya que alguien que abre 1 caja por dia y obtenga items malos podria ser visto como alguien quien no ha jugado mucho al juego, mientras que alguien afortunado que abra 1 caja cada semana y obtenga items buenos podria llegar a ser confundido con un jugador experimentado.Esto ultimo hace que no haya ningun tipo de sensacion de progreso para el jugador.No recomiendo su compra considerando todos estos puntos en contra que el juego tiene.

I can't really stand up for this game as it is right now, they HAVE to do something quick to fix it.     Maybe someday I'll have fun actually starting a match and not having to deal with huge desync, no-regs and all kind of weird bugs that happen literally all the time.

Especially considering the fact that this game has had so much support from seemingly everyone on steam, the end product seems like a spit in the face. It's the perfect example of a game gaining too much traction before the devs could even finish it, early access at its worst. The people who bought this game (including me) are the reason this game is the way it is, we can sit here and complain about Bluehole all we want, but the financial incentive isn't there for them. As for the game, it's a laggy, repetitive and overhyped♥♥♥♥♥♥show that only got this far because it's a battle royale game with shiny graphics, nothing more. I have learned my lesson when it comes to buying early access games, never again, never again.

Theshinkicker	Not Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029148181/	PAX East 2018 sealed the deal for me to DELETE this game from my PC.  Waited 2 hours in line to play the new Warzone mode. FINALLY Sat down with my 4 buddies ready to kick some butt and the dev's / booth workers changed the game mode so that 98 (out of the 100 who just sat down) were turned to Zombies and were tasked with hunting 2 twitch Streamers who sat down with us.  The game mode was changed to benefit the 2 streamers and screw the 98 of us who wanted to try the new mode.    WHAT A WASTE.   When we brought it up to the booth workers we received a lazy shrug and careless "sorry..."        PAX EAST was a fantastic way for this group to show who they REALLY care about... aka streamers... Not your average player.    I have DELETED THIS GAME and will make sure this is constantly brought up when I can. This was added to the PUBG official Twitter page too on Friday of PAX East 2018.

Ollie	Not Recommended	39.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/obenns/	Honestly I thought I would really enjoy this, but that is not the case.It's buggy as hell. I appreciate it's still early access but they've got the funding. They have a button on the main page to 'refresh the UI incase it's buggy'. If that isn't an indicator of what to expect I don't know what is.Performance is terrible. People with modest rigs still suffer from poor fps.It's so clunky. Things you can't walk up or climb over are just beyond frustrating. Putting your gun to a window or over a desk prevents you from doing so. When you think you're picking up ammo off the floor, you end up picking the gun instead, you switch back but then have to reload the gun again, even though it was previously loaded.The maps are so large half the time it feels like a walking simulator. You spend 50% of your time staring at the floor for items, 49% walking and 1% shooting.The general gun mechanics are strange. There's been several times I've pumped a full round into someone (the blood spats are an indicator it hit) and the player is still alive and shoots you dead in one. Other times I've shot someone with a shotgun from 25 meters away and killed them in 1 hit.The devs themselves are poor too and act like children. It's just a massive cash cow now. Here's why: - Bringing in micro transactions during early access is just unethical especially after the amount it's made in sales, there's no excuse.- Bringing in micro transations when they clearly stated they didn't. So that was a massive lie.- They ban people for stream sniping and even those that aren't. There's no care for their players. They support the streamers because it's their way of marketing and getting more sales.- They ban people from their forum that have posted a polite opinion.- They cry when another company "steals" their idea, even though battle royale style games has been around for years.

rawdogmeat4	Not Recommended	208.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rawdogmeat4/	Let me start off by saying that this can be a fun game. However, I'm writing this review because there has been issues with higher ping players ruining the experience of PUBG for other players (mostly players in Asia ruining it for the rest of the world), and I've seen firsthand through deathcams that my killer not only doesn't hit me with hardly any of his shots, he even misses shooting allies, yet still somehow kills them.My issue with this personally is that the developer, Brendan Greene, has come out and defended players exploiting this, saying and I quote: "They love the game. Why would we restrict them from playing on servers? I just don't get the attitude of some people." Proof: http://www.pcgamer.com/pubg-players-respond-to-bp-apology-with-demand-for-chinese-region-lock-over-cheating/Why is this a problem you ask? Because there isn't anything being done against anyone that exploits higher ping; PUBG has sold more copies in China than in the US alone. Why not? If you can openly cheat, and have the developer back you up, why not take advantage of the situation? The problem with this is, this "fanbase" of his is only temporary. His dedicated fanbase is people who play in their own region, with their own decent ping, and enjoying it. (AKA, the rest of the freaking world) He is spitting in their faces by defending people that intentionally exploit high ping to gain an unfair advantage, and I find it sickening he is doing it without regret.As it stands, I cannot recommend PUBG to anyone except people with masochistic personalities that enjoy the idea of players on the other side of the world beating them with invincibility and network lag in their favor. Until the developer wises up and stops catering to only one set of people, I will inform any potential buyer that he doesn't care about them enjoying the game, so long as he gets his money in the end. I hope others will join me in this effort to show him that he can't bully people into accepting his twisted line of thinking in which cheating is acceptable.BUYER BEWARE. And region-lock the game like you should've at the beginning.
Watkins	Not Recommended	340.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014749757/	OverviewThe game is fun for the first month or two after buying, but it doesn't take long before you start to get tired of the same two maps and same bugs every damn time. I've had a lot of fun playing this with my friends, but also a lot of strife trying to get it working and dealing with the numerous bugs/hackers that plague the game. Pros:+ Realistic graphics+ Great gun mechanics+ High population (easy to find a match)+ Easy to learn, hard to master+ Feels great to win, can be intenseCons:- Slow loading times- Black screens, random crashes- Terrible main menu UI- Laggy gameplay (especially at start)- Only 2 maps- Poorly implemented vaulting system- Buggy (dozens of bugs, differing in severity)- Abundance of hackers- Glitchy vehicle physics/controls- Uncaring devs- Annoying fans obsessed with hating on Fortnite because they're insecure *UPDATE*ConclusionIf you can get past the bugs, the glitches, and the hackers, the base game itself is really solid, the gun mechanics feel great and the realistic graphics look nice. Which is why it's a shame that everything else is a total mess. For the price of the game and the quality of the updates I don't recommened buying it. Instead of fixing and improving their game, the Devs decided to ignore the playerbase and focus on creating lazy gun skins and bringing out regular cosmetic lootboxes, all this after rushing an early release for Xmas sales.... As soon as a rival Battle Royal game is released PUBG will go the way of H1Z1.

[57.TUGAY] Ibrahim Pasha ∞	Recommended	22.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ibrahim_Pasha/	This game is balanced between Arma and H1Z1, a perfect balance between realism and fun.It also has a lot more options than H1Z1 like adding customization to guns (It makes you keep looting mid-late game more) and every weapon has spray pattern and recoil not like H1Z1 everyone jump out of car with shotgun or peeking through corners by jumping with shotgun.Also you decide when to jump out of plane and jump in which direction. In the other hand in H1Z1 you can be f*cked up right when game start by placing you near too many other people.Only downside is optimization, devs should work about it other than that this game has enormous potential.

Waterworker	Not Recommended	376.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198056860843/	In the beginning it was something almost new, a new take on a recently new genre (for a sole game, not mod) and was fun and great to play with friends...Then the cheats came. In almost every match, on any server. I've tried them all. Seeing one person constantly take out 30+ people within 5 minutes is just off putting, let alone being killed by them yourself. Optimization and graphics, lag and hit boxes are still incredibly bad. The loot boxes and microtransaction should've been put off til full release when bugs are fixed and the game isn't gonna crash constantly or bug out. Money grab - probably will never get fully finished imo. Same as h1. Don't waste the £, it's time has passed.

Lapis Infernalis	Not Recommended	451.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198162280381/	Back in summer 2017, when I bought this game in EA, I liked it very much. It had (and still has) its problems like hit detection, server lag ... but it was fun. You had time to loot nearly wherever you wanted in the beginning, you could do nearly every strategy or tactic you liked, whether you jumped directly to a high loot area, took a vehicle and moved to the far end of the zone or you looted your way along some houses to the zone... All these strategies worked for people.The mid-game was quiet, I have often seen or heared no one till there were only 20 people left. I have to say, that my favourite strategy back then was "I drop far far away and dont`t go to the cities", so this could have been a side effect, and other people would see this different.But nonetheless I liked it, how it was. It was a great game!But then...then they made the first adjustments to the blue zone. It wasn`t much and back then, I thought it was to optimize things for all of us. But I was wrong! For the last half year they made many "small" adjustments to the zone (faster starting, more damage, more DOT the further you are away) to get PUBG ready for e-sports. Nearly everything in this matter was to appease the e-sports community, which wanted a faster gameplay, because the old was to boring for the spectators. I feel sad about this and it angers me a lot, that because of a small part the whole PUBG community has to suffer. That the loudest in the community are probably fast-paced-shooter-lovers, who cry "faster, faster, faster!", make it even worse, because all the other voices who liked the game how it was, were drowned in the loud ones.And now....update #10. I have already played some matches with the new update and I have to say, that I DON`T LIKE it! Sometimes I wasn`t even at the ground when the first timer was already ticking! How should I loot if I have to move instantly to get to the zone?! Maybe I`ll have time then... oh sorry 2nd zone starts in 90s (200s before), you need to go! Oh, you`ve taken damage? You are at the edge of the blue? You need to heal? No time! 3rd circle starts in 60s (150s before) and you have far to go! If you are unlucky and the first zone is far away and you have no car, you can probably give up, because you will most likely not be able to reach the circle before it moves again. And since they added extra damage the further you are outside the circle... RIP...Also with this update, there isn`t any time for tactics anymore. Dropping far away, thinking how you engage an enemy or attack a building takes too much time. You will have to move before you can do it. In addition, they increased the chance that the new circle is in the center of the old one, even the last circle will shrink to the middle! They took away the last bit of fairness in this game. Now everybody will go for the middle because the circle will probably be there. What will come next? I don`t want a game where I can make a list of what I'll have to do next! This is just boring. If I wanted a boring game, I wouldn`t have bought it!Please undo at least the horrible changes to the zone you did in update #10!I WANT MY OLD PUBG BACK!!!edit 14.04.2018:I really apreaciate it, that the devs undid the changes to the zone! I also hope that next time, they put big changes like these much longer to the test servers than for update #10, so that something like this won`t happen again.Maybe try the slower zones as in #10 and zone 2 with 180s, zone 3 with 120s, zone 4 with 90s and the rest like #10 with 60s cooldown. That is a bit faster but should be enough time to loot and fight.And one solution for those who like a faster game/copetitive mode would be extra servers. So you could choose if you want to play on normal mode or the faster e-sports mode.
The Polite Terrorist Cow	Not Recommended	651.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thepoliteterroristcow/	PUBG------------------------While PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS can occasionally be an obscene amount of fun with friends, this game has so many issues that it borders on the unbelievable and in many cases it walks a fine line that teeters on the unacceptable. This review is far too long and blocky in text, so for those who like TDLRs, theres a non-specific and "short" summary. On the other hand, for those who are OK with reading into this game's issues, I'll go into some standout specifics from Developer conduct to this game's notorious plethora of technical issues and shortcomings, alongside some more casual observations made from someone who has put way WAY too much time into this trainwreck of a game that I just absolutely love to hate...TLDR: PUBG is not very good!*GASP*! some may say! "But its a bestseller on Steam! It has broken records for the most concurrent players on a Steam title! It is played by literally millions every day! Surely its not terrible!" others may say! And to be frank, this game is, at first, really something else to experience! Its tense! Its thrilling! It encourages teamplay, coordination and callouts in duos and squads in ways many games simply dont! And cooking your first, second, fifth and twentieth chicken dinners can make for a truly memorable time! However, after the initial 'honeymoon' phase is over, the game starts to show its true colors and the tape and glue that are used to hold together this mess of a game only become more and more transparent with time. If you and a group of friends want to play together, and you have a PC that can run it (basically 3+GB of VRAM w/ ~10+GB of system RAM; CPU isn't as huge a factor with this game), then you may find enjoyment with PUBG until the aformentioned honeymoon phase passes. If you want to play it but may not have others to play it with and don't need to scratch at that Arena-Style 'Battle Royale' itch, then I'd look elsewhere.  Either way, should you choose to pick it up, chances are you will likely find yourself getting frusterated with the game more often than not once that blissful phase of elated innocence passes and the bad really starts to poke out from this mangled heap of broken mechanics peiced sloppily together with duct-tape and glue... The Devs...As for the specifics, lets start with the devs backing PUBG ("Bluehole Ginno Games", or more specifically, their newly expanded subsidiary known as "PUBG Corp") who have made some pretty questionable decisions and statements throughout their games' time in Early Access. Such statements and decisions include the likes of: The (frankly) asinine statement they made regarding the 'Battle Royale' mode in Epic's game 'Fortnite'. The way they initially and continue to handle user banning within the community when it comes to abiding by their self-proclaimed "Rules Of Conduct".  The controversy related to the partnering with a Chinese VPN service, in-turn forcing a large part of their Chinese playerbase to pay to use servers that were more localized.  More recent developments surrounding the news of publishing agreement between 'PUBG Corp' and 'Tencent' and all the associated controversies relating to all that. Loot boxes and market items! (despite the creator stating that this wouldn't happen in early access)[www.gamasutra.com]...Suffice it to say the devs have had plenty of issues with their darling of a game and certainly haven't done much to make most consumers flock to their side. While consumers (that means you!) ought to know if the devs of a game do stuff that could be considered in violation of basic pro-consumer ideologies, none of this dictates the playability of the game, which we are going to dive into right about now!Technicalities: How PUBG swallows RAM & VRAM alive...This game is an absolute mess, technically speaking. Lets get the blunt and obvious out of the way. If you have 2GB VRAM or 8GB system RAM or lower, you should seriously look into buying a different game, or at the very least, read up on the issues this game has ('buildings don't load' is the short of it) when it comes to not having enough RAM / VRAM. As for other technical issues, here's what 400+hrs of my own personal gametime alongside experiences shared with friends has equated to: This game will crash, a lot. If it crashes in Fullscreen, it can sometimes lock up your PC entirely forcing a hard-reboot. The servers may, at complete random, crash, disconnect you, rubberband or simply drop your framerate to levels that even Powerpoint would look at with slighted disapproval. Unless a dev cares to say otherwise, your framerate is tied to the server, which is capped at 144fps  The servers being capped doesn't much matter when my GTX 980 struggles to get this game (on the lowest settings) above 80fps in most areas Hitreg, hitboxes and percieved damage outputs are inconsistent and vague at the best of times Shotguns are still broken Loot still spawns in late. Sometimes it will even spawn in front of your very eyes! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ The game's sounds may randomly flip from your right-to-left ear and vice versa Occasionally sounds will entirely fail to play for effects Some sounds (buggy, boat & rain maps especially) are far louder than anything else in the game for no reason The bombing zones will sometimes cause clipping/overlapping audio. They can also cause the game to spontaneously crash The jumping and upcoming vaulting "systems" will make you appreciate the joys in being glued to the ground 24/7. Conclusion:Its been nearly a year since this game was put up on Early Access. As others have said, seeing PUBG go the way of games like H1Z1 & DayZ is not too far-fetched at this point, especially given the suprising lack of talk beyond PUBG's "1.0" release, which kind of feels like the last big thing this game may see. And that sort of breaks my heart, because despite PUBG being an absolute mess that is barely being held together, there are some moments this game has given me that no other game can rival. But between the devs and their actions, and the countless bugs and crashes I've endured, I can not recommend this game to anyone right now. It may be worth looking at when they exit Early Access sometime in the upcoming months, but until then, consider staying clear, especially if you have a budget PC.
Inblʘ‿ʘd	Not Recommended	548.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/inblood123/	They ♥♥♥♥ed up by breaking the promise of no microtransactions before leaving Early access.They ♥♥♥♥ed up when they said they need more time to test updates(they can't even do their bug fix updates without breaking something,thats with their ''testing'').Also why did they do test server updates that lasted for 1 day?Ah everyone forgot about that bull crap.They ♥♥♥♥ed up when they thought that they are the only ones allowed to make battle royale games.And now they want to take precautions against ''similar games'' ,currently Fortnite ,wee.If you play solo,you will see a ton of chinese players in EU teaming (Working Together) in solo mode and if you kill anyone you can get banned,because hello mass reports.Same in Squads with sometimes seeing 8 guys/girls walking around in red T-shirts with constant background noise on microphone and teaming on the 3/4 man squads.So the game needs more content,maps,new guns ,ect...  but instead lets add more crates and not the kind that you get for points and open for free,nooo.You get crates that you need 2.50$ key to open to get a 0,04 cent red shirt that you have 20 of .Overall if any other Battleroyale comes out that does semi realistic shooting and driving in it,pubg is dead on steam.Fortnite brought it down on its knees and the devs are just pushing whatever support they still have into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Instead of supporting their player base with new content and communication the instead push down more ways to get money out of people(from an already 30 $ pay to play game) and putting nothing of value for  players to enjoy.Don't get me wrong,you will (most likely) enjoy the game,hell,i was i got my moneys worth of memories and good times ,the issue is with the devs how they treat the games fanbase as idiots and lie on constant basis or say nothing at all.
Sunny Senpai	Not Recommended	255.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sunny_senpai/	This game is fun and I really love playing it, especially with friends but I currently don't recommend it atm cuz it's plagued by plethora of issues and hampers your experience everytime. Here's why: Unoptimised game of the decade Cheaters still rule the game Requires a top end PC to run at stable 60 fps Absolutely crap netcode Wonky and terrible animations Severe microstutters outta nowhere "Network Lag Detected" Total crap 17 Hz servers that may die any sec Every major patch they release screws up the game even moar Ridiculous vehicle with beyblade physics and controls Occasionaly game will be stuck on loading screen Random connection timeouts Constant invariable frame rates CTDs 20% of the time Still rubberbands (door puzzle) Asset flips CPU killer Chinese everywhere =_= Killcam and spectate is not accurate Bullet hit angle inconsistencies, o boi Fecked up FPP aim when near walls or windows Moar players near = Moar lag (imagine 10~20 alive in finale circle lool) Camera jerks like hell when in passenger seat, can't aim or heal up Dat horrible lag when someone shoots/ when I shoot and after landing on the ground Cannot rejoin a custom match if disconnected/crashed, lost a tournament due to that Depth of Field when ADS is cancer, can edit config file but you will get BANNED -_- Red zone explosion sound = Ear raype 25 MB update every 5 hours (srsly?) with no changes More investment in useless crates and skins than actually fixing the mess they made A DLC now eh? pls P.S: Too many Desperado crates :p Buildings won't load and you'll get stuck between walls or objects once loadedGraphics are so terrible that it looks like huge pile of junk created back in 2000. Gobbles up my 2GB VRAM and 4+ gigs of RAM even on lowest textures and settings. On top of that, to even struggle for fps is just pathetic. All of this even in the so called final release v1.0 #Update 7, I can't even imagine how it used to be in Early Access as people say "It got better" _/\_It's powered by the famous Unreal Engine that made beautiful games like Bioshock Infinite, Paragon, ABZU, feck even Fortnite, an another Battle Royale game which used to be in the same boat as PUBG in terms of optimisation on start, now I can run it on epic settings 60fps @ 1080p without any hitches. Dunno why the whole world is praising this game and they say it's "Esports ready" for this unplayable garbage. All those people yelling "A perfect example for Early Access" shut it please. It's super far from being a full game. You need a beastly PC to fully enjoy the game in it's merciless glory of Lagginggrounds, it still does lags a bit on top end rigs too though.But despite all these problems it's fun playing the game, if all these problems were fixed then it's probably the best game ever made, but I don't have any hopes though cuz we are talking about                                                               B L U E  H O L E                                                   a PUBG cash grab corporationA perfect example of v1.0 in this generation of gaming ladies and gents4/10

Offline	Not Recommended	95.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145458492/	It just got released, and honestly, it feels almost worst than before.The optimisation got a little bit better, but it's still really bad. The netcode is horrible, sometimes it even makes the game unplayeble. Yes, there is new content, but it is worth nothing if you can't enjoy the game.If you want to buy it, I recommend you wait a year or so, because in it's current state - for me atleast - the game is just not fun.
Salty	Not Recommended	123.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mimicx/	V1.0 is here. If it was still in Early Access, I wouldn't have written this review. But one expects a better polished game with 1.0.- Desert map is buggy. You cannot shoot through a chicken fence!- Cannot choose what map you want to play on. So if you get desert map, gg you. Most of the time that is what you get.- Passenger seat is laggy for the passenger in certain vehicles, like the bike with side car.- You queue for Duo or 2 Squad, you go up against 3 players squad.- Don't even get me started on the servers that can't handle. Rubber banding all day (I play local servers, OC, on gigabit net. Don't think it's my net. Friends also complain about the rubber banding).Are they having a laugh calling this V1.0???V1.0 made some aspects worse. The new desert map is horrible. On the upside, everyone is in the same boat when on the map, so you're not at a serious disadvantage.My biggest complaint about the desert map is the broken fences. I was in a duo, we were 1 of 2 squads alive. Other squad was behind a fence. Both of us were shooting at the one guy behind the fence, not a single bullet landed, using sniper rifles. Once we are reloading, he just moved out from behind the fence and shot us. FIX THE DAMN FENCES!!! You go and release v1.0 with such crappy bugs as this, with no option not to play the damn map. I will keep this review in mind and change it once this♥♥♥♥♥♥is fixed.

R3SOLVE	Not Recommended	32.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/therealresolve/	They went back on their promise of no microtransactions during Early Access.Not to mention, the lag, bugs, desync, poor FPS in certain areas, grass render distance, etc.  Too many things to consider.The fact that they went back on their promise of no microtransactions shows a lot to me, and it shows that they don't respect their community.They aren't even offering a free alternative like most good games do.This game is a moneygrab by a terrible Korean dev that also ruined Tera.  Do not buy it, it's literally the same thing as H1Z1.

Razorkiller1337	Not Recommended	67.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trubkiller/	While the gunplay is still my favorite out of any Battle Royale shooter, the devs are still milking every penny out of the community before they actually expand their tiny studio despite already having millions of dollars to easily get technical help... And then they copied Fortnite's pass system which in theory is good and dandy, but Fortnite's works because the game itself is free to play, while PUBG is $30...also ironic that you sue Fortnite over some petty similiarities but then shamelessly create a $10 pass system that is obviously inspired from Fortnite without realizing the irony...Edit: The Pass is misleading in that the coolest items in the pass are time limited and not permanent, as if you couldn't get more anti consumer: https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/8sj43y/psa_if_you_are_planning_to_buy_the_battle_pass/ 
mammo101	Not Recommended	338.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mammo101/	honestly pubg is a great concent. very fun because it is a little more realistic than most games, but there is so many hackers in this game that it legit ruins all the fun from the game. imagine this, you drop in a zone... kill the few people that dropped in the zone near you, and all of a sudden you got shot by someone who is over 300meters away using an AR and none of his bullets miss, and his aimer is not even anywhere near pointed at you. so if you like a game where the odds are against you not because there is 99 other players you need to fight through to earn that chicken dinner every player wants, but the fact that when you queue into a lobby. you have over a 75% chance to be in a lobby with an aim bot hacker, using wall hacks, and location hacks, and see through building hacks, and god knows what other hacks these losers need to use to win. so yeah. i dont recommend this garbage game. wasted 300hrs on this. and more than 50% of my death are probably hacker related. DO NOT RECOMMEND. oh and a side note. this game LOVES to add new crates into the game. were 70% of the crates also require you to buy a 2 dollar key. so yeah instead of wasting time doing pointless updates, and adding more petty ways to earn a dollar from us. try spending your money youve earned on a anti cheat system thats actually good, and maybe ill return back.

MigzuM	Recommended	334.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/migzumisfatpolishboy/	This game is something that we've been waiting for long time Battle Royale game that make us try our hardest. I can say that it beat H1Z1 just by determination on the game autors it's pure game created for concept of Battle Royale, there's more options that let this game exist and also it's done by people that want to make it better and better all the time. I don't know how those people have so many brilliant ideas but it doesn't matter how difficult it will be to implement these ideas and they will do so. All this things getting and change game for better i think and nobody will change my opinion.I hope They Keep this game alive as long as possible :)

Littlebloss	Recommended	494.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/littlebloss/	PUBG is like that one girl you fell in love with. She's great, she gets you, she's fun, she is everything you were looking for. She also turns out to be a gold digger, cheats on you more times then you know and makes you work for it just so you can pay for it too. You maybe start to realise she's really not as hot as she use to be. She never really loved you but she also need you to stick around a little longer. So she'll start feeding you good news, she'll try to change it up, wear new clothes and change her hair just to keep your interested, Oh which you've likely worked for and paid for, for her. And when things seem to get worse that's when she tells you she will change and everything will be ok but to be honest 4 years later nothing really will change and she's likely leaving you for a chinese man... if she hasn't already.

Kodylex	Not Recommended	251.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/codylex/	For disclamer purposes:  I do enjoy the game with friends, but I don't recommend it to a certain type of players for the following reasons.(TL;DR below + possible solution)To the average casual gamer, PUBG can be a lot of fun since it's a game where everyone can find ways to get kills, even if they don't survive the match and have fun. But to the competitive gamer that relies on skill and intelligence it can be frustating.Do not expect a win-advantage if you are a skilled player. It's heavily based on RNG (Random number generator) which basically determines if you win or lose from the start of a match. My only personal way to enjoy the game is with friends: You double, triple or quadruple your chances (RNG) to aquire decent loot (weapons, meds, armour, cars etc.) and you boost your chances to make it far into the game (possibly win).The casino-like system within the game works either in your favour: plane trajectory over bigger areas, early survival loot (weapons, armour, meds, cars), close first zones, positioning advantage, etc....or the RNG works against you: plane trajectory over dense areas (low loot for high number of players), low to no early survival loot (pistols vs rifles, no armor/helmet, no meds, no cars), extremely far away first zones (+no car), positioning disadvantages (open fields, no cover), etc.Apart from the game itself, the developers deserve huge credit for creating such a popular and well-made game.TL;DRLoot/Weapon/Car RNG, positioning and zone (based purely on luck) are the primary factors to win.Skill, movement and intelligent play are secondary factors.Only recommened to people who play in groups and/or casually. Not recommended for solo/competitive players who only rely on skill.Feedback & Suggestion:Since the game is based on RNG, I would personally enjoy more ways or alternatives to promote intelligent and skillful gaming:-transparency over RNG: red zone probabilty, weapon drop percentage per density / buildings, etc.-different game modes: free-for-all in smaller zones (e.g. rifles only), training / aim servers with bots, etc.-improved first person experience: creating a skill ceiling for aimersI don't think PUBG should remove anything, just add more ways for players to improve their gaming experience (since 50 players die in the first 5-10 minutes of every match and only 1-4 players "win"). There are endless posibilities with an open world 100-player map game. I look forward to the future of PUBG.
twitch.tv/authorawehbe	Not Recommended	335.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ahmadwehbe/	Meh.I quit this game for the same reason I quit CS:GO. Two game killing reasons:#1: Lagg CompensationVery stupid technology that should NOT be used in competitive games. If you don't know what Lagg Compensation is, let these two examples encourage you to uninstall:#1.1: You're 100% certain you hit someone in the head. Yet you miss, and on the replay it shows you missed. WHY? Lagg Compensation.#1.2: You're 100% certain that you managed to escape behind a wall, but you die anyways, as if your butt had expanded far and beyond the depths of the universe, into the black hole of the gun-pipe shooting at you. WHY? Lagg Compensation.#2: CHEATERSDo I need to explain this?It used to be at least ONE cheater in every match you played. However, things have changed... there are more hackers now. In the past you would hope that a team would have killed the hacker half-way into the match. But nonono, now YOU will have to deal with a hacker ALMOST every game.(Just because someone else has to deal with the hacker, doesn't mean there are no hackers. This line exists for the braindead).So what kind of cheaters will you find in this game?WallhackAimbotNo-RecoilWalk-Through-Walls, (No-Clip. Yes, you can be looking at a door, waiting for the enemy to open it and walk out into your line of fire... yet you die for some reason. The death cam shows the enemy peeking through the wall to your far right, taking his time aiming at your head... because somewhere in this cheater's heart, there is diginity, the dignity not to use aimbot, because only noob cheaters use aimbot, real cheaters walk through walls and take their mother fu***** time to aim, right? (S-A-R-C-A-S-M)).Radar-Hack, they see every player on the map.Speed hackAnd other types of hacks that make losers feel better about themselves. Too bad there is no life-hack for them, ha ha ha, get it?#3 Random Bugs, that you would expect would have been fixed after years in testing.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w8o4TCflbAY---------------So those were the cons, now it is time for the pros:Meh, I guess if you don't take the game seriously and just play for fun, then who cares! Do some roleplaying, enjoy driving around in a car or boat. Troll people like going inside their car, or make traps. Stalk people and see how far you can make it before they realize it. There is plently of fun to have in this game as long as you don't play competitively.- King Ahmad--------------Additions based on comments.To those who keep saying there are no hackers:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pvS6lbFVvUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3fd9yTNKOCoConcerning Lagg CompensationYes, lagg compensation is very good in online Player vs Environment situations. But not so in Player vs Player situations. It is just a lazy technology for cheap game developers NOT to invest in many server points spread out across the globe, who instead focus on BIG server points in specific areas in the world. It is a technology born because of the current limitation in data transfer over large distances; to compensate for the discrepancy caused by the physical distance that DATA has to travel; from the processor sending the DATA, to the processor receiving the DATA. The only thing lagg compensation does, is cover up the DATA loss, it doesn’t actually solve the physical issue (only a physical solution can solve a physical issue, one progress is IPv6, but that was the solution for a completely different problem). What lagg compensation tries to do is repair the damage VIRTUALLY using a prediction algorithm to decide what really happening. Basically, it tells the server to run a simulation… taxing the server’s processor… all while the game is still running for the other players. Now imagine this process running for every bullet that every player shoots. That’s a lot of wasted processing power just to satisfy customers who cry over “choppy” movements. But lagg compensation also works with movement prediction technology. Which means that during the simulation, the server will try to predict your movement using what IT BELIEVES you wanted to do. So let’s say you hold W, and then you see an enemy so you push A to dodge their line of fire. Here is the funny part. The simulation might predict that as if you were moving forward while strafing to the left, instead of stopping your forward movement. This explains that rubber-banding-feeling where you go “heeey, that’s not right, I didn’t even move there”, it is because the simulation is based on the PREDICTION of your movement, not your actual input. Lagg compensation is actually great for people with slow reaction times, however, for people with a fast reaction time… it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Games feel heavy, character movement is clumsy, and unresponsive, even if we have a super computer and the best connection available. But yes, lagg compensation is very important, to give customers a smooth experience… however, please don’t pretend that it is competitive gaming, because that’s just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

Dinguin Farster®	Not Recommended	36.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198092444616/	I am on the verge of recommending this game and not recommending it. I feel I am a bit more towards not recommending it since the game overall is not that special. It can be fun when playing with friends but the fun comes more from the tension created by interacting with your friends always watching out and being on the move since running around is really all you do for the most part. There is not much variety in the game. The game does not look amazing, but can run very poorly. even on a machine that should run the game smoothly, specially for how it looks.  Opening doors feels like its own game, since opening doors, getting into vehicles and picking up items is unresponsive and frustrating. The game shines in its combat and sound design though, specially in close quarters environments. Unfortunatelly most combat usually takes place near the end of the game. Turning into a who can flash, rush, hide or run around the closing circle the fastest competition. Unless you decide to drop into one of the large cities players frequent. In which case you will likely be fighting more often but at 20fps.Until the game is optimized more, made more responsive and injected with more variety in both graphics and gameplay, I will lean towards not recommending it.  
AMZ	Not Recommended	523.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AMALZ/	PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS "PUBG"is a Battle-Royale, 100-players, Open-world MMOFPS/TPS set on a massive 8x8km land. The game supports solo, duo, and squad (3-4 ppl) play. Gameplay is very straightforward, you hop off a plane, loot weapons, armors, and equipments from buildings, and survive the thrilling PvP bloodbath.PUBG is obviously not the first massive battle-royale game out there, yet it stands on the pinnacle of its genre. As you may have known, PUBG has had a highly successful launch, securing a place on Steam's Top Seller game. If you're looking for a good battle-royale PvP, look no further. Firstoff all I'm not usually a Battle Royal player, but this game is perfect for my play style. the game is buggy as all hell. Literally anyone that's played this game for more than 2 hours will have run into at least 1 problem. Let's start off, PUBG does a lot of things right. The gunplay, when it works correctly, is phenomenal. It feels tight and responsive, the bullet physics feel accurate, and especially rewarding when landing long range shots. This is arguably it's strongest suit. The original map that the game launched with 'Erangel' is a great mix of different terrains and hotspots allowing different routes to be taken in order to achieve victory, and is easily the stronger map of the two. Despite the multitude of things that PUBG gets right, it gets so much wrong. Hackers are a major problem in this game, even after the implementation of PUBG Corp's proprietary Anti-Cheat. Wallhackers, Aimbotters, Norecoil. Hackers are rampant in this game. Ping abuse is another problem. There is a reason you see people spamming #RegionLockChina, and it's not an attempt at racist humour. Not in the slightest. People from countries such as China, tend to join NA and EU servers in order to abuse the fact thaat the desync in this game causes them to be able to demolish people without any issue due to the fact that they are next to impossible to shoot, due to their high ping.However, none of my complaints matter at the end of the day. I bought the game, PUBG Corp/Bluehole made their money, and that's all that counts at the end of the day. :DDo I recommend this game? Sure, I guess I do, winning in this game is a sheer adrenaline rush. It's unlike any other game I've ever played. Do I think you should buy this game? No. Not until this is a stable product, that has a handle on the hackers, has fixed the issues with servers, and has restricted access from players from a high ping locale. IMHO HANDS DOWN the BEST Battle Royale game released.

Blzzx	Not Recommended	530.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198343906106/	After spending almost 400 hours on this game I thought I should write a review about this one. Let's start PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is a lot of fun with friends even solo but those devs at Bluehole don't know nothing expect how to earn more money because they haven't earned enough by selling copies of the game. The game is simply unplayable this is a joke full release game, there's tons of bugs, servers issue, desync, cheaters, etc. Simply they pushed 1.0 full release so more people can buy the game because it got popular meanwhile the game is not even finished and it's so bad being handled by Bluehole devs, really. All those guys want is money, money, and money nothing else. The game optimization it's not how it's supposed to be when a game gets released first thing that they should have made perfect it should have been the game optimization but no. Game still runs like crap, lets not even talk about crashes, oh and let's not even forget that the "parachute bug that when you land you get stuck" still exist believe it or not, and you call this a full released game BlueHole? No, this is not a full released game. This game is simply a joke to Bluehole. Like I said those guys only want money nothing else, why aren't they working on the game optimization, bug, cheaters? Because they probably don't want or either those devs are simply so bad that they cant handle their own game. Meanwhile they add emotes and skins that nobody asked for, this is a joke. Everyone who paid for this game simply got scammed. Steam should never ever let EA games on Steam anymore. This is the last time I paid for an EA game. This is not full release, this is a scam. WE ALL GOT SCAMMED.Oh, and the reason I have so many hours is because of the crates.
[SFW]Cereal Killer	Recommended	237.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pannawora/	While there are still many bugs and glitches in early access period, the gameplay is really fun and so addictive. The devs are doing their job well in fixing bugs (even there are still some). It's more fun when you play with friends either in duo or squad. What I'd like the devs to improve is adding more servers to cover all the region, so there'll be no advantage / disadvantage due to lagging or high ping.Overall, I recommend this game as it's fun and keeps adrenaline rushing.*edit*I wish the dev would add more maps, not just the weather, because this map is getting boring.

=SM= MonkeyFiend™	Not Recommended	155.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeyfiend/	While the hackers are an ongoing problem, it feels like the hit detection and bugs have simply not been addressed.Instead of optimising and improving the core game, we've instead got loot boxes and a paid DLC.The shame is that this game has potential to be great, but it seems like the developers are intent on making it a worse experience in favour to grab as much money as possible.

Shame because there used to be something special here.
Gutbuster	Not Recommended	70.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bustagut/	I originally started playing this way back in the day in early access. I put off the decision to purchase it due to perceived lack of polish from the footage I had seen. It simply seemed way too clunky and unfinished for me to enjoy. However, bunch of friends eventually convinced me to give it a try. I was right. It was a mess for the lack of a better way to describe it. Graphics were ugly (Think ARMA, only worse. And I'm not talking about ARMA 3). Movement mechanics were clunky, performance was horrible, the LOD made everything look like a person from the distance. So many times a bush was mistaken for a person while running.. Inventory management was slow and unintuitive. Sounds were unimpressive and made it very hard to pinpoint where footsteps were being originated from. Driving mechanics were pretty bad and the physics were way off, cars occasionally doing some impressive acrobatic trickeries.All in all, not enjoyable. I did keep playing with friends however. And some good times were had. But there was always the irritated feel when running into the huge amount of issues the game had. So I took a lot of breaks from the game. Only popping back in when people swore the last few patches "changed so much". Only to be disappointed. The framerate climbed up slightly, but still being way below acceptable for a game with such low graphical fidelity. All the clunkiness was still there. Did give me a chuckle when they made such a huge fuss about adding vaulting though. A thing that always should have been there.I refrained from posting any negative reviews or uninstalling as it was still a game in development. But even after over a year in early access and a full release out, it's still an unfinished mess in my book. It's especially sad considering all the other BR-type games that have been released after it with much more polish.TL;DR; Unoptimized, clunky, duct-taped together product that can provide some good times. Not worth my money.

While the core gameplay might be enjoyable, the cheating situation is completely out of hands as soon as you reach a somewhat decent matchmaking rating (MMR). Meanwhile the netcode favors high-pingers and you'll regularly die behind cover due to people abusing this fact with lag-switches or simply queuing up from regions where they shouldn't even be allowed to. Up until 1.0 the liveclient was pretty much unplayable due to cheaters for 3+ months, now with 1.0 the new wave of cheats brought a situation even worse than before. And if you don't believe me, just watch the dumpsterfire unfold on the r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS subreddit, the discord server or catch a few threads on the official forums before they get closed and deleted. The game needs strict REGION- and PING-LOCKS, asap.Update (March 2018):As expected by the weeks of deafening silence, the devs half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥their implementation of "ping-restrictions" and instead went for "ping-prioritization" in matchmaking. What this means is that you'll be facing slightly less high-ping players if your connection is stable and if there are enough people playing in the region you queued up for, but since the matchmaking does care more about fast matches than fair ones, you'll encounter blatantly obvious cheaters and chinese high-ping players in EU just as regular as before. The anti-cheat system is a goddamn joke. The ban-system doesn't even use HWID bans, hell they didn't even ban the owner-accounts of family-shared cheater-subs. These devs give no flying ♥♥♥♥ about their western audience and they basically threw the player-base under the bus in favor of inflated CCU numbers and pleasing their chinese net-cafe customers [that cheat and ruin games, get banned way too late/inefficiently and therefore simply create new accounts, rinse&repeat] just to keep PUBG up in the steam top10 list.Stay far away from this steaming pile of hot garbage. The game doesn't value your time, neither do the developers value their players (well: besides kiddy-advertisers streamers) and PUBG Corp.'s PR department might as well be run by patients in a persistent vegetative state. When they're not busy playing dead you can expect a whole lot of "literally nothing" bundled with some PR fluff and new loot-boxes. The fact that it took them almost 3 months to scramble together the intention (!) of coming up with a roadmap (read: vague ideas after the dog ate the PR department's homework; expected to be revealed in March; literally an announcement of an announcement) to PUBG's further development says it all.This game is the definition of streamer-bait coupled with a developer studio whose work schedule is somehow, coincidentally trapped in this weird foreign timezone of UTC+AmateurHour.Update October 2018:Yeah, so about "region-locks"...PUBG Corp. half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥another half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥another attempt of "fixing" the high-pinger / out-of-region-players problem, this is what they did with update #22:We’ve also updated how regions work in general, so that the server closest to you will automatically be preferred when the matching pool in that region is sufficient. If that matching pool doesn’t have sufficient players, the next closest server will be chosen.After 1 1/2 years of players begging them to region-lock China (because there's no reason a 400ms+ ping-warrior should be able to queue with you in EU / NA) or at least properly ping-locking players to their closest server-region, the "solution" for this long-term problem was half-baked from the get-go.They truly don't care about the gameplay experience of their players as long as new accounts (from 13 million banned cheaters) are generating new income for them. We still don't have HWID bans. We regularly see blatant cheaters (who are reported, temp-banned, then "permanently banned") that are somehow getting unbanned a few weeks later to wreak havoc again. It's ridiculous. These devs have learned nothing.

shark2ooth1	Recommended	497.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shark2ooth1/	This is the first time I have written a review for any game so take it for what it is worth.The main reason why I am writing this review is to say how awesome this game is. Keep in mind that it is early access so there is some work that needs to be done, but as it is right now its a great game.I was a little hesitant to get into DayZ or H1Z1 just because of all the negativity revolved around those games which was unfortunate because survival PvP games are my favorite. I haven't played many simply because people who play them typically ruin the game and it was hard to find out that leveled the playing field, but still made it intense and fun enough to play. I personally do not use any cheating software and I have no idea how to get or have any desire to, but I feel like this game does have some cheaters in it which is very disapointing.Besides that the game is really fun. With it only having one game mode I keep finding myself going back for more but, I can only play 2 or 3 rounds every time just because you invest so much each time you play which I love!! You really have to think during the game and try to anticipate the other players moves. I saw a guy block one of the bridges to cross with vehicles and I was impressed that people come up with in game strategies to gain an upper hand. If you use outside sources to cheat then I wish your PC will spontaneously combust cause you ruin it for everyone else you low life.Over all the game is a great platform that levels the playing field for all players and its up to how skilled you are and some times how lucky you can get. I haven't played the game multiple times and each time there is a different out come or I go a different path. I highly recommend this game and this is why I wrote this review because I felt that I had an obligation to testify to the greatness and simplisty of this game.

AkulBIG	Recommended	305.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/akulbig/	This is the best Battle Royale game out there. The shooting mechanics are the best in this genre, and the devs maintain a constant update stream to it with new guns, vehicles and  even a new map! The only issues with it its the performance, even after leasing early access the fps doesn't correlate to the hardware and the game's visual quality. More fun with friends.
str8 homiesexual	Not Recommended	295.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lulzmofobbq/	- Tons of bugs-♥♥♥♥♥♥hitreg / pathetic tickrate- Still UNOPTIMIZED (I even meet the recommended settings, yet getting random lag spikes down to 20-30FPS with ALL settings on MINIMUM)- Other players that are going to the nearest compounds simply don't render/show up - you can only hear their parachutes when they land next to you- On Ultra this game looks how it should in 2018. The only problem with that is you can't see enemies hiding in the bushes hence it is so detailed. If you turn everything down you can spot enemies WAY easier, about 400m away grass just doesn't render you can see enemies lying on the ground in the middle of nowhere - while from their perspective they are hiding in the tall grass- Poor server performance- Devs don't do♥♥♥♥♥♥except adding new skins and crates- Can't change zeroing distance on any sights/scopes except 8xThis game does not worth €30!

It was like seeing the underdog beat champion after champion. Plus, the game was half priced!There were lootboxes at first. The lootboxes were not ideal, but they were free! Then the first paid box: the Gamescom Invitational. This was alright though because it was only one box, and the proceeds funded the tourney. That's fine!That's where it started. Then it became the worst of the worst.MICROTRANSACTIONS!When you buy a lootbox with ingame currency, YOU DO NOT KNOW WHICH LOOT BOX YOU WILL GET! There are free crates and paid crates, which require keys for $2.50. There is 50/50 chance that the lootbox you buy with ingame currency will still require a KEY which goes for $2.50! YOU OPEN A LOOTBOX OF LOOTBOXES AND RNG DECIDES WHETHER OR NOT YOU GET TO EVEN OPEN THAT BOX FOR FREE!Let's talk about the Battlepass! Bluehole charges people $10 for a for a pass to unlock challenges for cosmetics. These challenges last a few weeks. The common cosmetic unlocks are yours forever, but RARE COSMETICS UNLOCKED VIA BATTLEPASS ARE TIMED COSMETICS! YOU LOSE THEM WHEN YOUR PASS IS UP!"FIX PUBG"BLUEHOLE! YOUR GAME DOESN'T WORK. IT HAS BEEN OVER A YEAR AND YOUR GAME STILL RUNS WORSE THAN MY GRANDMA AFTER HER KIDNEY TRANSPLANT! Bluehole made a big "FIX PUBG" initiative where they laid out a roadmap for patches and optimization. Does this need to be explained in detail to see how repulsive this behavior is? Bluehole didn't care about performance until the review bombs started, and now the company tries to place itself as the "PRO-CONSUMER GOOD NICE GUY" for making patches when the issues the company is addressing should have been fixed well before the 1.0 launch.NO CONTENT!Content drops are few and far between. A new gun is added once per total solar eclipse and a new map is like seeing Halley's Comet in the night sky.Bluehole drip-fed consumers bad content, made little to no effort to fix their game and instead pumped development resources into microtransaction and monitization strategies. This is a game which could have been, and was, incredible. It has been ruined by greed.

(IE: Crates of cosmetics that cost an additional $2.50 to open, even after hours of hardwork and grinding to even get a crate with ingame currency, and now this Sanhok Event Pass which dont even get me started, they have TIMED cosmetics given to you. are you ♥♥♥♥ing for real? i earn a item in game that goes away regardless of buying your stupid pass?)#2 the Netcode ala server stability. so many times have i died to rubber banding or "network error detected" For a company who advertises how popular the game is how much money they make etc etc. they dont spend a dime on improving the games servers or netcode to modern standards. #3 Hackers, not as prevalent now as it used to be when they opened the gates to chinese playerbases, but the fact remains they do very litle in managing cheating prevention. sure we have battle eye, but battle eye sucks and everyone knows it, i used to script hack Arma 2 DAYZ all the time with just one program (CE) and im just an amateur cheater.  I dont care how much they advertise cheat prevention, its way too easy to get around.i could go on for more bullet points but this should suffice, the game is good at best and is worht 30 dollars to play it, i do not however recommend you ever buy keys for crates. if you do play the game only sell your stupid crates for 3 cents on steam market and be done with it.

Volcanuz.-	Recommended	1,363.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Volcanuz/	Update on the review as the changes for 10/21/2017 and prior.Wow. Haven't updated this for 2 months and to be honest there is good reason for that. The last update i talked about how the 8/12 patch ruined the game harder than expected and well i can tell you the bugs and issues are still rising to which feels like a soon collapse.With more and more users coming to the game no matter what due to the popularity on stream,   youtube, and now even more celebs using the game while talking about it. We seen a huge rocket in users at peak. With this came issues with the crappy web page based menu which would see crashes and login errors due to massive numbers trying to use the game at once. This could be fixed by making a que system for game and at least making the menu a proper coded non-HTML mess but that is more for people who understand that sh*t to really ellaborate on as i personally am not savvy enough to talk more about it. So along with those issues what is is wrong? You ask.Well a lot of things. The biggest problem right now is the rise of hackers, for a good while they were there, but not very present in the world, you would bump into one at least once every 50 or more rounds (well that was what it was like for me if not even more rounds between an obvious one). Now you will see one every second game and if you are unlucky to be playing in a region plagued with them you won't go one game without some form of cheating going on in game. Battle eye is banning, which is nice, but the fact the Asian market (not all asians cheat i know and i am not saying they are, but majority come from there you have to agree) has flooded with cheaters who use the ingame battle points system to earn steam wallet then turn it into real cash allows them along with cheaper keys, allow their accounts to get banned without them batting an eye. This just means the ones who get banned will just come back with another account and cheat again so they can keep the cycle up to make money. This is the major reason why i have always been against cosmetics and market systems in games and always will be. I love cosmetics as a choice to alter your character don't get me wrong but connecting it to any market place will always make insentive for cheating, account stealing and gambling which is never a good thing for a game ever.I still love this game but the issues are so large i can't even add them on this updated post.. i just need this game to get its sh*t together for crying out loud. I love this game and still support bluehole, but i need them to get it together.--------Let me start by saying this is the best battle royal game i have played and i have played all (this includes every mod based battle royal too.) except h1z1's but that waas due to UI and loot mechanics(i didnt like the inventory).First ill give the pro points.PRO:-Large map, it has a lot of areas from thick forest to thinned out forest and lots of cover from rocks to bushes and other random set pieces. Lots of swimmable areas and even a town that is flooded. Military bases and military checkpoints all the way to hunting huts. There are also nice little hidden loot spots too which is nice.-Loot. As said, every building you can see spawns loot. All of them. There is not one human made structure that doesn't give you loot.-Weapons. As of now there isn't a massive array of weaponary but what is there is very useful, from pisols, smg to sniper rifles ALL have a high leathality. My highest killing gun is the UMP which is a 9mm varient in this game and it destroys people within 20meters. There is not one gun that doesn't feel like it is useless.-Buildings. All are very well designed and i feel that the layout inside feels realistic to what a house would have. I mean compared to something like ARMA where you don't know where someone would sleep let alone take a dump this game actually has toilets, pantrys, bedrooms and kitchens. This is useful because it lets you pick better locations in side of the house to have a gunfight in and more objects to hide behind. -Servers. OCE, Asian, South American, North American and Euro as of now are in the game, which is nice. The latency is great and i have not had one issue yet with my connection to any of the servers i have tried (Asian, NA and OCE) with 180ms to NA servers and 30ms to OCE servers. -Server load. 100 people in a lobby/match. Short que time with minimal lobby time wait of only 2 minutes tops. If the lobby notices that no one else is joining it will auto start the game after a count down. This means you can have 30 or so people in a lobby then it will start which can at times be annoying but still is nice if you want to play late at night and just have a  really intense match with a small amount of people.-Cars/boat. 3 to choose from at the moment and one boat. All drive very nice compared to Wildlands(the ubisoft game) with minimal issues bar one for me which is that some times it takes a while for the game to notice im trying to enter the car. Not sure if bug or just locational activation issue.-Weather. It can rain. Not sure if anything else but its nice to have that feature to change up the match. I personally hate it because you can hardly hear anyone around you plus it causes frame issues for me but thats because my computer is pretty garbage.-Team and solo mode. Okay now this is what worried me about this game. But it was instantly settled once i started playing. Solo means SOLO no teams at all or teaming. I mean people could team up but i have never seen it. Duo is 2 people only, and Squad is up to 4 players, you can enter with 2 or 4 if  you want, or you can just go totally solo into squad for an insane challange. Medical supplies. It takes time to use meds, i know as a BR player healing can be very irritating to deal with in a fight as some can be fast and others non-existant. In this game it takes 3 seconds for Bandage, 6 for pain pills(which is an over time heal) 6 for first aid kits, and 10 seconds or more for Medkit. CONS:-LOD issues. I personally get this because i have a normal HDD which is very old and needs to be replaced. But some other people i know have had this issue before. It causes buildings not to load in properly and feels like you are running 1-2fps. You think its  your GPU but it isn't its your HDD or RAM being overloaded so it causes the computer to freeze up. A good fix for this is to make sure nothing else is running in the background prior to joining a game. This issue can last as long as your HDD is jammed up or at 100% load. -Terrain/map issues. Remember with an Alpha or BETA game you will always run into these. Some times if you jump up onto something, it will get you stuck, and there are some locations on the ground or next to walls which will cause this same issue where you are floating. There are also some invisible walls but very few of those.-Overall Optomization. Pretty much not fully optomized. Expect to change your settings to medium or low/verylow. This can be a pain but later the game will be fully optomized so just take your time.-Voice chat. Lots of spam so you may aswell turn it off most times. -Price. Pretty high right now so it can put you off. But if you love Battle Royal games it is so damn worth it i swear on me mum. Other than that i can't think of any other problems with the game. I am by no means a fanboi of this game i didn't even try get an Alpha version when they offered it. I thought it would be another Culling or a crappy version of H1Z1 but i am happily proven wrong. I know there are probably more pros/cons i could add but right now none are so glaringly visable that i need to add to this review. The only thing that bothers me the most is just my own hardware not keeping up with this game and that i can fix myself in my own time.REMEMBER THIS IS A BETA RELEASE REVIEW. I will continue to update this as they update their game.
viRo	Recommended	114.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/viRo369/	Dunno why, but I love the atmospheric rainy weather and Chicken Dinner. <3╔PROS╗ Developed with community feedback! Made by Brendan Greene. (BR: Arma 2 Mod)   Lot of intense, adrenaline and unforgettable moments. Good looking & fresh graphics. (Unreal-4-Engine) Acceptable ingame-balance so far. (e.g. weapon spawns) Good reward system. (Still in progress) Simple but effective weapon variety and customization. No random spawn, you "decide" where to land on an massive 8x8 km island. Work hard against cheater. Battle-Eye, forum and algorithm demo search.Very good & smooth menu guidance. (Highlight matching parts) Early access game, yes - but core mechanics of the game are 99% solid.╔CONS╗ For some people performance needs to improve. (But they work on it) Movement animation looks sometimes bit strange. (Maybe because of lags?) Hitboxes sometimes doesn't fit. (Lags?) Some distance graphic bugs, which can cause advantages. (e.g. shoot trough not loaded trees/stones) Sometimes the start of a match is unplayable laggy. (EU Servers)╠OVERALL╣Personally I play with around 40-80 fps (i7-4790K,16GB,GTX 960-4GB) and it's surprisingly enough. In my eyes, ~9/10 matches telling their own exciting story and only ~1/10 matches are frustrating because of bugs/lags. But the Developers are working hard and promissed to final release it in 6 months. In its current state and my experience 04/02/17, its my new first place BATTLE ROYAL game and 100% worth the price tag.@ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸( 8,5/10 )¸,ø¤º°`°º¤ø,¸@╠ADDITIONALS╣[How to Fix fast FPS-Issues] by viRo369Go to Library > right click PUB > PropertiesClick on "Steam Launch Options"Add the following into your steam launch commands: -USEALLAVAILABLECORES -malloc=system[How to FPS-Boost Guide] by azgoodaz[How to change the FOV] by ʏᴏᴜʀᴇPRIME

ploopploop	Not Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ploopploop/	What started out as a great project with a lot promise got destroyed by 2 things:- Devs- StreamersDevs:They have their focus on the wrong priorities. Right now the game is at a pretty good stage content wise, but stability wise it needs a lot improvements. This applies to server side and optimization.They also tend to listen to a small bit of revenue called streamers, instead of the bigger audience. Banning people by using information they obtained through legitimate methods ISN'T what banning is supposed to be for. Sure this won't ever get read by them due to 170k+ of reviews but still I feel like voicing my opinion. Streamers:This paradise of special snowflakes is where the real issue is at. They pressure the devs and the devs fall for it. If you decide to blatantly put out all your information to the whole wide world then you are a FOOL. It is a battle royale. If you stream blur out your map or something if you really have to or put up a 5 minute delay, it ain't that hard.. unless you ofcourse lack a few braincells. So apart from this, due to all the ranting of these special snow flakes the devs decided on banning people that made use of watching streams (and those that didn't but still got a kill). Aparantly if you kill someone you can never be better than that person if it is a streamer so you get banned. They believe they are the best in the game and when they get killed they always think it's a stream sniper. I sure do hope the devs redeem themselves again, because fortnite is taking advantage of their stupid mistakes.I am honestly♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off that some of my mates that I used to play with got banned over no reason. Apparantly they were stream sniping DURING our lan-party... where each person had 1 monitor... with pubg full screen. As of now I don't recommend this game. You will get banned sooner or later because some special snowflake will think they are important enough for you to watch their streams and hunt them down. And this will get you banned even if you have never heard of them before, which so far has been the case for 99% of the bans. Go look for a different battle royale until the devs get their priorities right.Edit:There have been 2 ban waves since I first posted my review in which 2 times A LOT innocent people were banned.Edit 2:They are sueing Epic Games because they think they own the genre "battle royale" even though a dozen of games and movies were way earlier.There is no reason to buy and support this game.And yes the game still isn't optimized. They rather implement more issues and sue companies instead of fixing their own product.Edit 3:And another banwave hit a lot innocent players, however this time when they submit a ticket to appeal for their ban (many people showed similar results) the staff says that nothing is wrong with their ban system, resulting in many innocents being banned without it getting lifted.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, EVENTUALLY YOU WILL BE BANNED WHETHER YOU CHEAT OR NOT.

Had a blast until they released it from EA. Ever since then it's been worse and worse with every single patch. 408 hours and I feel like I'm a ♥♥♥♥ing gear delivery guy. I'm shooting at a ♥♥♥♥ing guy 10 meters from me, M4 fully geared up, 40 bullets go into him, he turns around and kills me with 3 shots. I look at the kill cam and the guy heard me walk turned around and killed me, but I haven't fired a single bullet. What the ♥♥♥♥? Or I'm shooting at someone further away and my shots disappear. I'm not hitting the target (who is prone on a slope) and my bullets are not hitting the ground. Where the ♥♥♥♥ are my bullets going then?Oh and another thing. Recently, after one of those excellent patches, the game started dropping FPS. I get 60fps when I'm outside, ultra everything etc, then I enter a ♥♥♥♥ing shed and it drops to 30fps... ON A ♥♥♥♥ING 1080Ti !!!!!!! What the ♥♥♥♥ am I supposed to do then??? Buy a better card? There aren't any!♥♥♥♥ you PUBG Corp. Go ahead and release new maps and new ♥♥♥♥ing clothes.

Crowii	Recommended	52.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crowii-/	Best Battle Royale game avalible on the Steam Market right now.I've had the pleasure of participating in the closed beta as well as preordering my copy ready for Early Access release and I've got to say; I like where this is going.PlayerUnkown invented the Battle Royale game mode, his experience from ArmA and H1Z1 now combined into this amazing game BATTLEGROUNDS.You'll start your adventure in a jumbo plane with the other 98-100 players sitting with you, in BATTLEGROUNDS you get to choose when to jump and decide where to land and begin looting instead of it being a RNG cluster ♥♥♥♥ of "Who can land first and find a gun first"Like many other games in this genre, you're forced into an ending point but in BATTLEGROUNDS they've substuted the cliché gas by an energy field, spooky stuff.Airdrops will drop in throughout the game providing you with better weapons or health items.You will rage at some point playing this.Pros:Amazing gun playTerrific atmosphereGreat in game clothing customizationEqually great in weapon customization.A crate-styled skin economy that worksA large map with various different kinds of areas to explore; Power Plants, Flooded towns, lumbar yards, quarries and more.An amazing forum with active mods and a friendly community.Cars feel satisfying as hellCons:Optimization at this time needs a bit of work, too many times am I freezing from landing, going into my inventory or picking up an item.Sound needs some improvements, hearing shots can be fine but if you get shot there's a big "Click" sound that completely nullifies you telling where the shot come from, sometimes footsteps can be silent but I'm sure this is a bug.Some map areas have these "lines of higher ground" which completely destroys you if you drive into one 
Ringmaster	Not Recommended	295.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994002070/	Hackers. Unoptimized. Servers bad. Not worth it until later.-EDIT-They have made A LOT of improvements to gameplay, stability, and overall playability but...... they still need to make many more....Growing pains????I hear it runs terribly on the Xbox lol. Fun game all in all, but they are going to milk the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of it. Oh also, there are new loot boxes that you have to buy a key for to open, and those boxes are given to you at a much, MUCH  higher rate than any of the other currently available ones when you claim your rewards..................... Purely cosmetic items, but still.Hackers are still a problem, though nowhere NEAR as bad as they used to be, not even close. Although improved, it's the same with servers, unfortunately. (Long story short)If there was a sideways thumb, I'd change it to that.It is fun though..... SOMEHOW...Chinese playing on US servers are going to ruin this game faster than they can take an entire magazine, survive, and kill you.*Will continue updates*Hackers in full force in Third Person. You can expect to see at least one every game, and if not, then it's a huge surprise.Region lock China. Ban IP's.*Last needed updtate*Still not optimized correctly, still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ Instead of making some changes to what needs to be attended to, they port it to console and MOBILE devices.... LMFAO. Not to mention, it's turned into a cash grab. The in game currecy is now practically worthless, and any box you get you need a key for, that you have to buy. Event pass? Pay 10 bucks to play on some map and get a chance to do "missions" and unlock some outfits? Maybe...... if it wasn't only for a MONTH.

Luna	Not Recommended	110.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NightHorse/	This game used to be cool and promising. But the company behind it has lost sight of making a good game and now only seek profit.Seeking profit is fine, but this game has horrifying flaws, bugs, and feels unpolished. I have given this game a whole year before reviewing, and I am disappointed by slow pitiful content updates. I am disappointed by the company's legal activity.The developers crushed item trading out of greed to force more steam community market sales. The company focuses on crates instead of gameplay, not working to make the game more fluid.Cheaters are still too common and the gameplay is repetitive. Without any workshop support, the devs simply can't make enough content to keep this game fresh, and the gameplay isn't refined enough to call it a serious esport.This game had promise, and we all gave the developers money because we saw that promise. I can only hope that at some point gameplay and community becomes priority again.

This clearly states the priorities Bluehole have in mind. They even have a history of banning players for "stream-sniping" without proof, while allowing streamers to record themselves using exploits. Now this company is threatening with "legal action" against its competition for "replicating the experience for which PUBG is known" as if they were the owners of the last-man-standing concept.

Dignatio	Not Recommended	144.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kyantu/	Fun game but its way too frustrating to enjoy. People need to play on their own servers. Not just China. EVERYONE needs to stick to their own servers. Game has a large enough player base to lock people to their regions but developers probably too busy swimming in cash to do something about it. It's not just the cheats either. How would you like it if you ABSOLUTELY GUARANTEE you shot somebody, but the game doesn't register it because someone playing from another country has such high ping that the game doesn't even think that they are where they are?Want to play a battle royale? Please save yourself the trouble and play Fortnite instead. Its got its own set of problems but at the very least its free (and less frustrating).Do not buy. Treat yourself to a nice meal instead.

Discarded Napkin	Not Recommended	370.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014206248/	Another Early Access failure. Steer clear.    Greedy practices have reduced this once innovative yet buggy product. Repeatedly, promises were broken, there was a lack of communication with the community and then came the rampant spree of lootboxes locked behind keys. This rendered cosmetics, the only source of "progression" in this game, almost completely paywalled. The rest is based on RNG with criminally low percentages. You have better odds at your local casinos than to win some of these cosmetics. Was worth the time when it came out... You could possibly squeeze out your $30 worth now... but you are not investing in a game with a future. Why must these devs continually break our hearts?

So for someone who hasn't already bought the game this long after launch I would say wait until it gets better because we know the game has made enough money for it to be pumped back into the development.

T.w²│King0fgames ツ	Not Recommended	54.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/King0fgames/	♥♥♥♥ the devs for sneaking "micro"transactions into the game while breaking their promise of none before EA is over. On release they've said there will be no more free cosmetics in game, so anyone who buys the game will be running around in their underwear for eternity. Totally fair. They don't need the money to fund a damn tournament for a broken game, they made $100,000,000 already! Why the hell do they need to charge $2.50 for a single piece of clothing (YOU COULD PAY 2.50 FOR SHOES YOU NEVER SEE IN GAME)???This review will change if they reverse their decision, which the goddamn better.

Chunk Nasty	Not Recommended	971.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198068873641/	This game was very fun when it came out. For about a month now its been nothing but hackers, dsync, crashes, ect. They need to quit worrying about vaulting and new weapons and focus on items that will keep players on their game. They had the winning formula. Sad to say, I would not recommend getting this game the way it is now.

Yggdrasil	Not Recommended	276.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198260069764/	As a Chinese player who speaks for the largest player group of this game, I must tell you guys a fact about how Bluehole handled server issue. Because there is no Chinese server and playing in any server like NA or AS will give players a lag over 200ms, nearly every single player in China needs to spend considerable extra cash compared to the price of the game monthly to purchase access of a net proxy to get rid of the lag. Usually 4 months membership fee of a decent proxy costs the same money to buy a PUBG. But instead of trying to solve that problem for the region that has the most players in the world, Bluehole just made partnership with the most popular proxy company in China and claimed it to be the official proxy for PUBG. And that is absolutely ludicrous! There is not a second region in this world that needs to pay extra money beside the cost of the game itself to play, not to mention that cost is paid monthly. The developer is not only not trying to make that extra spending go away but also making new partners to rip players off more. As a player I found that very very insulting and Chinese players are treated very unfairly. Upon of all that, the game itself still have a significant amount of bugs and lack of optimization. Even for my PC, which has 7800x and 1080Ti as well as 32g ram, I still need to adjust certain settings to low even very low to have a relatively smooth game experience. And that "smooth" is still relative. I literally have fps dropping every single game, especially when it is raining or when im in a redzone, which is really annoying and irratating when I am trying to shoot someone or scounting the nearby environment. Anyway, that's the reason why I dont recommend this game. If you hate fps drop in a FPS game, I strongly advise you against trying it.

Find a better game.Sorry but this review will remain negative until these developers who made millions fix this "competitive" game and make the registry of shots up to par with a 2017 MODERN SHOOTER. I know this is an early access game but honestly when you spend more time pumping out crates for profit vs. improving the game we all paid for it gets a little old.I'm sick and tired of being outgunned by someone who lives across the world with 400ms ping because the game auto adjusts to make it "fair" for everyone in the match. End the matchmaking crap, it has not worked for a single developer out there. Give people the ability to host dedicated servers and get out of the server hosting business, you are not good at it.We need 100tick+ PC games, stop pumping out new features and instead focus on improving the core mechanic... no serious gamer cares about pink mini skirts and yellow jumpsuits.Come on Bluehole, get your stuff together and make a serious effort where it actually matters.Currently I will not be recommending this game to anyone who does not have it.

vaderspore™	Not Recommended	374.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022485362/	Let me start by saying that i do enjoy this game.... While its functional..Since the game was released and was in early access i was fine with how tha game may not function correctly. Played over 200hrs and the only major problem was the desync, which is to be expected while the game is pretty much being funded and developed at the same time. After the 200hrs the game became a almost unbearable to play. It had desync and some other bugs which were very ground breaking. The game breaking glitches were worked on and were getting fixed. 250hrs in and guess what... HACKERS. While its to be expected, the hackers ruined the gameplay, not just for me, but for 90% of the player base. A month or two down the line the develepors and Battle eye began to work on stopping hackers as much as they could, however they still havent finished. Now, since the desert update, there have been not only hackers but still some ground breaking bugs and STILL! desync. The desync should have been fixed before the game came out of early access, but it still hasent been fixed. The fact this game is now out of early access and still has some bugs that can insta kill you is awfull. So the day im writing this review, the game crashed, i came back to the game and was invisivle to my team mate. i could interact with everything but could kill anyone or even move on the server.Now that ive explained my experience and views, i should note, if these issues were to be fixed, the game would continue to climb to the most played game and may even be "the best game" but the MUST fix desync for a starters. They then need to work on fixing ground breaking bugs, such as the one that i mentioned about about the game crashing.
WEEDBABYGOKU420	Not Recommended	1,226.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ROBOBALBOA/	I really like this game, but I'm having a hard time recommending it after some of the decisions made by the staff.  Essentially, they have set up some fairly bad rules regarding punishments for "stream sniping" and teamkilling.  The current review system involves a user submitting video evidence, and that is the only evidence available to the reviewers.  There is no in game log yet, or replay system.  Rulings are decided by inexperienced community managers in what may as well be a popularity contest.  Both rules already have multiple instances of weaponizing, in which players who who defend themselves against a team killer was banned and someone was accused of stream sniping as banned due to the sheer amount of viewers who reported him.  I'm here to play a Battle Royale game, not take part in a popularity contest.

im josay	Not Recommended	333.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrpandatoh/	There's more hackers than players in PUBG. Meeting hackers have become a norm for all of us legit players. It can be so disappointing to find out that you can almost never win when there's a hacker in your game. There's hackers with aimhack, wallhack, speed hack and even "godmode" hack, where the cheater cannot be killed no matter what. Meeting hackers are so frequent that PUBG ratings drastically dropped from Overwhemingly Positive to Mixed Remarks. Not to mention teaming that too ruins gaming experience. A 45-min game ruined by a single cheater that did not even put in effort to play the game or getting killed by 8 players. Do cheaters actually hack to get access to the game, or do they actually buy the game itself. I doubt they bought it. Here's a tip, either give your developers/workers a raise so they can start doing their job to start banning cheaters and teamers, or find the loopholes for getting this game for free to cheat on, or you know, ignore the gaming community and let them pay for bad gameplay, since you're already earning huge profit. People are going from PUBG to Fortnite, just imagine how disgraceful is that. People pay for PUBG and ended up playing Fortnite. Do something or this game is going to be as dead as Overwatch, "Game of the Year". Forget optimisation that never works, start solving the cheating problems by removing possible loopholes.

I really feel ashamed for all of the hours I’ve put into this game. The developers are♥♥♥♥♥♥poor and go back on so many of the promises they’ve made. No to mention, they tried to make the game “E-Sports ready” before it was even optimized. That♥♥♥♥♥♥pisses me off more than it should, that stupid greedy, fame hungry ♥♥♥♥.To this day, the game still runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥ there are hackers plaguing servers, horrible network issues, and I won’t get started on the stupid stupid micro transactions.Bad developers equal bad games, and player unknown has really shown his true colors in the last few months, he practically worships streamers and happily bans anyone that offends them, he lies about updates, and is so incredibly ♥♥♥♥ing greedy. This game is not worth $30, it’s worth around $15, there’s simply not enough content in here to justify that price. The game runs like♥♥♥♥♥♥as well, so there’s that.But my biggest problem with this game, the very reason I’ve stopped playing, is because this game has the most disgusting and toxic community I’ve ever seen for a game. It’s absolutely repulsive. The n word is spammed in every lobby, everyone thinks they’re better than everyone, and I can safely say I never heard a single nice comment from anybody in this game ever. It’s horrible. It’s like a congregation of the entire Rick and Morty fan base. ♥♥♥♥ this stupid ♥♥♥♥ing game.

Derpy The Sloth	Not Recommended	877.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/c00lrthnu/	A great game thats being ruined by the rampant cheating by an incredibly large number of players. I have played a grand total of 5 games today alone, and all 5 of them have ended in me being killed by soemone with their hacks being displayed completely out in the open. I've seen 30 people instantly disappear from the alive counter seconds after players have landed to one person getting headshots on dozens of players simultaneously. I've seen players blatantly looking through walls and scoping in on player's heads and watching them get shot from hundreds of meters away through dozens of buildings, trees, etc. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is getting absolutely ridiculous and it needs to be stopped. I understand that while there will always be a number of hackers in any game, this is above and beyond the worst experience I have ever had with hackers in ANY shooter in my 12 years of playing FPS games. This♥♥♥♥♥♥is absolutely ridiculous and should not be tolerated by any development team anywhere, period.

It's free (which doesn't really matter since you'll end up spending all your money on cosmetics) but more importantly it's fun! Ok, so let me explain myself. The game itself is good. Sure there are some bugs here and there but it can be expected from a game like this and even thou i like the game i cant recommend it at the moment. The game has been riddled with cheaters for some time now and it reached the point where there is a cheater in 4 out of 5 games, this is especially true if you play Solos. And its pretty f*cking annoying. Imagine you just got back from work or school and you want to play a game of PUBG to let of some steam but instead of having a great experience where the most skillful player wins you just get aimboted from the other side of the map by some cheating trash. Sound pretty fun, right? And since the developers apparently dont give a f*ck about it why should you? So just dont buy this game until the cheater problem is fixed whether it is by implementing a better anti-cheat or a region lock.#RegionLockChina

If you enjoy being shot through walls from accross the map, if you enjoy some chinese internet cafe cheater being able to see you through walls then talk about how bad you are at the game, IF you enjoy not being able to connect when you want to play, or if you can connect be unable to invite your friends to the squad because 'REASONS', then this game might just be for you.I would steer clear until the devs get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together and become willing to do soemthing about the major issues plaguing this game.11/10 would get headshot punched while parachuting in again.#RegionLockChina

Game has so many randomized factors  which do not fit into a classic esport title( where gameplay enviroment has been set in a pre-determined state so that all players are on even playing fields and have even chance of winning and showing off their skill(Csgo for example)).4.

Kalil	Not Recommended	280.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kalil2204/	Pros:-More serious and grittier alternative to Fortnite-Potential for tactical and strategic gameplay-Fairly polished gunfighting and hitboxes-Warmode is fun I guessCons:-Dev team focuses on negligible balancing issues rather than game-breaking bugs-Is effectively the same game it was at the beginning of early access-Horrific optimization means 60fps is unlikely on all but high-end rigs-Often the server lags when many people are in a small area making crowded endgame fights unfair-Minor updates (introducing new crates etc) are huge and require you to basically redownload most of the game again-This means major updates are bigger than most games-Cosmetic microtransactions on a £27 game? Seriously?-Attempts to sue main rival, proceeds to leech successful systems like event pass for even more money-Anti-cheat system is non-existent, in my experience there is at least one aimbot/wallhack in most games-Dev team ban hundreds of thousands of hacked accounts in China, yet refuse to region lock servers when most hackers on EU have chinese or randomly generated names-On the above point, this is probably because they can milk another £27 out of the players who've been banned from AS server for their new account-Meh, seems that £700m+ is too little for this companyOverall I'd say it's an enjoyable experience to play and one of the better-funtioning games of its genre. Personally, I don't regret buying the game for £27 and playing it for 250+hours since early access. However, even considering its popularity PUBG is not worth buying for that price now. This game is not going anywhere in the future and the dev team's negligence will eventually cause players taking a break from the game not to come back to it unless something changes quickly.

GoldenDewMelon	Not Recommended	135.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoldenDewMelon/	Before I start: I know this game is very, very new, and that I'm sure that there will be many updates in the future that may fix the problems I am currently having with this game. However, this review will be less for people wanting to purchase it, and more for the developer/s that created it.To start this review off, I'd like to say that the idea for this game is absolutely fascinating. I love the concept of skydiving into a crazy warzone with a group of friends, searching for resources, and fighting against a horde of other people to try to be the top survivors in the Battleground. The music is nice, the setting (itself) is great, and the various different cosmetic items are refreshing. However, when it comes to execution and performance, this game is practically unplayable in its current state. Constant FPS drops (usually happens right when I see another player), various glitches (such as running yourself over), and a world that is so unbelievably large that it slows down the game to render objects that are just a couple feet in front of your character. No matter how low I put the display settings in the menu, the FPS and rendering problems still remain. I cannot tell you how frustrating it is to see that the game isn't any more playable on "Very low" settings than it is in "Ultra" settings. I have a very compatable computer, and it is almost equal to that of the reccomended requirements. No matter how good your PC is, IT WILL STILL HAVE TROUBLE RUNNING THIS GAME. This game often has crashed my computer, causing me to restart it (everytime it crashes). This game is very, very difficult to play when your FPS drops to about 1 everytime you encounter another person on the battleground. It isn't enjoyable to know that it is basically impossible to be the last man standing.I would rant more, but this review is getting repetitive. My advice to anyone thinking about buying this game:Do NOT buy it... ...yet.Give it some time first, there is a LOT to be updated and done, and I hope that the developer/s find a way to fix every single last one of these problems. Until then, I'll be keeping this review as a "Do not buy". I think I would really enjoy this game (if it would run smoothly enough for me to actually play it)!

Devil Azite	Not Recommended	390.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/devilazite/	Oh boy, where to start with this game? A game I want to like. Love even, but simply can't due to the company putting their (dickhuge) bottom line before their actual product.PUBG saw explosive growth thanks to the free advertisement of YT Creators and Twitch popularity. It hooked everyone into the Last Man(Team) Standing game mode and popularized a game mode by taking inspiration from the games that predated it and refined it into something that should've been a masterpiece. The game was good fun, good combat mechanics, and created some very tense Guadalajaran stand-offs that could pump you full of adrenaline, especially on your way to your first Chicken Dinner.Unfortunately, the developer has made some very questionable decisions when it comes to the game's longevity and that explosive growth has since started to moderately evaporate.The Good1. Combat, Weaponry and Sound- In any shooter, satisfying gunplay is key. PUBG aces this. Weapons feel and sound great to shoot, sound of nearby and distant gunshots keep you alert and aware of all the action occuring within your oscillatory environment, aiming is handled very well in both TP and FP with an added touch of steadier aiming when holding your breath. Subtle nuances like this make landing those 1000m kills on the person(s) or squad who's collecting their spoils of war from their own skirmish very satisfying. The options for rebinding and sensitivity for every aiming mode further allows for fine tuning. - Good sound design is something I heavily adore and the gun sounds are very distinct; you will know what weapon your opponent is trying to take you out with. This can allow you to auditorily size up your enemy to know what exactly you're going up against and allow you to determine if you have the means to engage. Vehicle sounds underwent a change, in my opinion, for the better, as they don't sound as grating and flat like they used to before and, like weapons, have their own distinct sounds that allow you to know what's about to run you over pass you by. The mortar strike sound update was majorly improved and you are now fully able to get in your last will and testament when you hear that whistling sound stop briefly before you are no more.- Weapons are modifiable and had a good update that now allows them to be even more modular for anyone who wanted weapons to be affected according to any given situation. I'm the guy who just grabbed a 4x, vert grip, ext quickie and compensator for his M4 but that extra viability in weapon assortment is always a plus for anyone who wants to suit an engagement to their terms.For a game that heavily uses store-bought assets (which I'm not against if it's done reasonably well as it is in PUBG), it forms a good, cohesive foundation for a game that had the opportunity to take the gaming market with an iron fist. Of course, Had being past-tense, I feel that opportunity is long gone for some of the most obvious reasons and very bad internal prioritizing obligations from Bluehole that have allowed games like Fortnite to eclipse PUBG in this game mode that is now being gangbanged by indie and AAA developers alike to get a slice of this pie that was so ready to be wholly claimed by Bluehole.The Bad2. Performance- Early access of PUBG was in March 2017 and was released in a very poor and unstable build. Optimization resulted in many of whom I know, and from the EA reviews at the time, playing on the lowest settings to maximize framerate. Stability and optimization, bug fixes and general QoL improved over time, but it was at a snail's pace and some patches left more to be desired. With the worldwide release in December 2017, the game was still in a relatively bad state deemed to be an official release, although general improvements had been made and the game was, for the most part, playable for mid-range PCs without much stuttering and audio cutting. 5 months after release (which was about when I stopped playing) the game's performance still suffers from stuttering, minimal audio cutting and should in no way be released officially. Putting aside the networking infrastructure, as that seems to be the hurdle for every battle royale game for the moment, the state of the game is playable but not optimal unless you have a high-end or enthusiast PC, but based on user feedback for PUBG, the instability of the game doesn't seem to guarantee 100% performance. With the graphical aesthetics of the game, mid-ranges should be loading this game no problem.3. Bugs- Will not lie, some of the bugs in this game are for the better; ridiculous collision physics launching cars, bikes, and humans many kilometers to their impending doom will never get old in video games. However, a lot of these bugs had serious impact on gameplay (the off-track aiming bug, parachute rebounding you in the air and clipping on weird things that can lead to a lot of health lost on landing or, worse, death, low performance players abusing texture rendering -- allowing them to walk, see and shoot through buildings, the list goes on.) Many of the gamebreakers got an eventual patch but some were few and far between and the wait was real for things that could've been bumped as simple hotfixes. Can't comment on the state of the game today since it's been a while since I last played, but from what I remember, the bugs, in my experience, were minimal in terms of affecting gameplay.The Ugly4. Hackers- PUBG was plagued FAR too long with hackers that really killed morale for me and my friends playing at all for quite a while, which I can only assume affected a good portion of the playerbase the same as us. They were subtle briefly, then came the half-map MLG Tony Hawk 900 no scopes with ♥♥♥♥ing buckshot. Your PUBG day comes to an abrupt end when you're in an apartment looting, hear a UAZ rolling by and you and your duo are sprayed dead by an UMP from that UAZ that's outside with absolutely no bullet penetration on walls. It started with maybe once every 5 games, then every 3, every other game, and on some days they were in every game myself or me and friends attempted to play. We've won chicken dinners against a few and there was no feeling of accomplishment to know that if we so much as exposed a hairline, we'd get ♥♥♥♥ing clipped. Last I saw, there were still some togglers out there who'd rack up 3 squads worth of wipes near the end of games, so that may or may not have changed now. I never cared for rank in most games I play but me and my duo made it to top 6% a couple instances but I never researched if the hackers were more prone to the higher or lower levels of rank. I should also note that we are filthy casuals and mostly played TPP so that may influence a lot.5. Bluehole's Bottom Line- I don't care about games including lootboxes that lets people play dress-up, but Bluehole should've probably spent more of that $700m they made in revenue to reinvenst in their game before rushing their release and introducing more monetization. Whatever argument anyone could give does not excuse the poor state of the game on its launch and the writing was on the wall about the priority for the game. The improvements were not steady enough to begin with and the extra revenue they generated from its inclusion didn't seem to motivate them either. As such, with the negative experiences in gameplay starting to get more and more frustrating, I decided to part ways with an otherwise fun game. While not inherently ugly, other personal annoyances included:- The exclusion of players hosting their own dedicated servers, only being provided to ♥♥♥♥ knows who.- A terrible HTML lobby system that occasionally makes starting a game a hassle.Amazing game with wasted potential. It was a fun ride while it lasted, here's hoping  Epic doesn't ram a stake into PUBG for any of you continuing to play.

Major_Pain_2513	Not Recommended	949.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030865611/	After 700 hours, it pains me to write this review.  But the game is no longer the product it was.  The crashes, instability and microtransaction focus has driven me to look to alternatives like Islands of the Nyne.  For about the last 60 days, the ability to maintain consist FPS and server connection has been a gamble.  The optimization pass seemed ok, but the server instability and connection issues have remained.  The resources for the game seem to be more spent creating skins for cash, season pass content and temporary reward to entic players to drop that extra 9.99 for temporary rewards.  Unfortunately, I can no longer recommend this product to friends or you, my fellow gamers.

TheManWhoPlays	Not Recommended	22.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025071765/	A good game that has been absolutely sunk by the worst administrative decisions. Greed got the better of them. The game plays the same as the day I purchased it. Progress is so painfully slow that the game is just stale, and huge optimization issues STILL exist. This is why the player base is evaporating.Fortnite, a FREE GAME, has a way friendlier microtransaction system, whereas this game is $30 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars and they make you pay to open crates and now they're charging more than Fortnite does for a WORSE Battle Pass.Meanwhile, communication is lackluster, promises are repeatedly made and broken, and the game is still a buggy, poorly optimized mess that isn't even all that fun half the time when it does work properly.This is absurd amounts of greed and it's obvious they're trying to milk this thing as much as possible as the playerbase plummets.PUBG deserves to die and I hope to dance on its grave.
Pvt. Cross [1124TP]	Not Recommended	768.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198108903152/	After sinking countless hours into this game, plus the time I've spent on the test servers, I feel like I can have a pretty good idea of how I really feel about everything.First off, I'm really counting on this game to get better after if gets out of early access in a few days, because anything in my review could be argued with the classic early access excuse.I figure I start with the pros just so I can start on a positive note because I'm still very hopeful for the future of this game.PROS  I don't know how they did it, but this game is one of the most enjoyable games to play with friends. Some of my best moments in this game were when we ran into a funny/non-gamebreaking glitch that doesn't stomp our game, or when planning a perfect ambush with outstanding execution.  Killing other players is satisfying (most of the time)... this may only just be a side-effect of the battle-royale aspect of the game, and not just be specific to PUBG, but no one is going to convince me that the feeling when you nail a running/driving headshot with a Kar98k isn't magic.The next few are specific to the current test server, I won't do any cons on the test server however assuming most of the rubberbanding and HEAVY crashing issues are fixed  Miramar is ****ing gorgeous. I adore that map, less room for pansy players and more for quick reaction times and *MMPH* the Winchester. Keep fixing all of the weak points in the map that your players have been posting on the forum and I believe you have a genuine masterpiece of a map.  The new vehicle mechanics are fantastic as well, no more suicide bike (for the most part), vehicles are more encouraged to use the road, poppable motorcycle tires, spinouts, rollovers, and most of all, the buggy horn. Thanks for working on that, Blueballs.   The vaulting implementation was something that I was extremely skeptical about at first, but I actually haven't ran into any heavily exploited glitches brought by vaulting that other players have used. Vaulting has been smooth and enjoyable, especially since players can designate a key exclusive for vaulting. Thumbs up from me!CONS>Load into a game after two crashes with two failed crash reports>Drop into a moderately hot zone like Prison>Aiming for the roof of Main Building>Try to hit close to the edge to land first>Parachute freaks out and sends me flying to the ground>25% HP>Run into the bottom floor to find a gun spawn>Spot an AK but rubberbanding back outside of the building>Player runs in from the other bottom floor entrance and grabs AK>Hear two shots while still outside of the building>842266423541 killed YOU by headshot with AKM>ctrl+alt+delete, task manager, end taskThe number of times that or something similar has happened makes me want to play ****ing Dark Souls for the rest of my life, but to break down those issues-  The crashing. Ohhhh the crashing.  Parachuting needs serious work, it is beyond frustrating to be stuck in midair at school while spamming F, then fling off the roof.  Why does a player named 5465432487 have better connection than me?  My biggest issue with this game right now are the cheaters. Any form of cheating in vidya makes me sick to my stomach, people deliberately trying to just ruin the game for other players. I don't care how strict or sensitive of a anti-cheat you implement, but playing the game for 20 minutes to get killed across the map by XiongChinaXiong makes me not want to put any more time into the game. Fat kids literally streaming on twitch with blatant hacks and bragging about it is absolute garbage, and I don't think I'll be putting any more hours in the game if the heavy cheating continues into 2018.  The sound needs to get fixed for sure. I appreciate being able to tell direction most of the time (As I should in a game where sound/sound direction is everything). I ****ing LOATHE not being able to tell where a shot came from though because of a pompous WHAP and AEUGH sound make by my character, I'm jumping out of my chair from how loud those sounds are, meanwhile my health is halved and I'm cluelessly running behind a tree to bandage only to get shot in the head a second time by the same player.... from who knows...  The entire crate system feels like a joke, finally waiting until the BP cost resets, then proceeding to open three (3) working boots in a row. Just not very creative and I'm bored of the only desirable items being the gas masks, ballistic mask, and coats. I hope they improve the cosmetics in the game without adding dumb*** keys and purchasable ingame currency.  Speaking of in game currency, I feel like the payout after 35 minutes of gameplay and winning is extremely underwhelming. I mean at least you get the reward of your heart rate finally slowing down and a washing feeling of relief... but I think you should at least unlock a crate right then and there rather than 1000 something BP, which sometimes won't even get you a single crate.CONCLUSIONI hate to copy off of what someone else said, but I couldn't have said it better. Bluehole only got to the battle royale genre first, that's it (Besides H1Z1 you ****wit, because some of us enjoy hit reg and desirable game mechanics). If PUBG Corporation doesn't fix all of these issues before another company worth a damn comes out with a better looking/better playing battle royale game, this game will die. I feel like the battle royale genre is a perfect genre to show off the upcoming future generation of video games, and I hope bigger companies take it further.6/10

It's Hunger Games, times a lot. In Russia. Game drops everyone off, kicks you out the back of a plane, and you're on your own to survive. You have to THINK ALL the time, be watchful and LISTEN.

Now, I immediately regret for purchasing this game which gives innocent players false-bans without even answering to them or even showing them any proof for being perma-banned. This is an Early-Access game and has the right to take such actions on players who didn't even attempt to hack the game? I smell greedy bureaucracy and people are actually thinking of starting a class-action lawsuit against PUBG Corp and BattlEye. I'd fully support such a thing due to the fact that they have a faulty anti-cheat system which marks innocent players rather than the true hackers.Aren't you ashamed of yourselves? Without your player base you wouldn't even have that little 'corp' next to PUBG. You don't even respond to the players, you just show them the way out ( post a ban appeal -> go to battleye support and they never respond ). What is this ?! People, wake the hell up, I've talked to so many players so far who haven't been hacking and had been ripped-off by these developers. We paid money for this game and had been playing according to your Agreements & Terms of service.People are now setting up a discord to talk about the legal procedures to be taken against this nonsense.

The concept of a battle royale game sound fun and intreguing, but the execution of it is cery poor. There is a destinct lack of polish in the game that really brings it down. Also the lack of rewards makes the game boring to play after a while of playing single. The rewards are too forgetable and unsatisfying and the fact that now you need to spend money on keys to open some of the crates creates another problem that leads me to lose interest in the game. There is also a lack of game options. The game is based on a battle royale concept, but that doesn't mean it should be limited in terms of options you can make. You can't even chose between maps letalone specificalities that you can have in other games like a certain gun type can be used or an option to chose the time of day.
Sir Warren Twinkelote	Not Recommended	524.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VADemon/	UPD: nothing changed. except I WAS FALSELY BANNED TWICE. fun times. Literal **ithole Corporationit's a long review extending into the comments; theKey notes:+ fun when playing with friends+ core content is enough to enjoy the game (map, weapons, vehicles)+ insanely addictive+ play it your way: whether you want to do deathmatch at school or loot safely in a dead-end village+ spiritual successor to Arma/Battleroyale mod- unoptimised - very low FPS- BUGS aka BUG-G (vehicle trampolins etc.)- broken main menu and poorly designed multiplayer lobby(fixed)- mouse aiming, responsiveless weapon handling? bans for stream sniping controversy? broken promise on microtransactions1) It's fun playing with friendsIt really is. Get a duo or, better, a squad together, all talking in VoIP and begin messing around! Sometimes it's not only fun to win but also JUST BE CRAZY! Crash windows behind team mates, road killing, grenades... Honestly, do whatever you want. Emotions rise when you play in a team and have those action-filled moments with gun shots coming from everywhere and a downed mate who is in urgent need of help.2) The Core content is enough to enjoy the gameHonestly, what else do you need? For weapons, there're various classes: Sniper rifles, Assault Rifles, Sub-Machine Guns, Shotguns, Grenades and Melee - each with a few variations so everyone will find a weapon he's comfortable with. Do you need 500+ weapons with exotic ammo types? Me neither.There're special rare weapons that can only be acquired by looting an air drop but this comes at a price - consider it a mini-event where multiple squads are hunting for it. You WILL engage in a fire fight, quite risky if you're out to survive for the Chicken Dinner!Tier 1-3 Helmets, Armor and Backpacks.Cosmetic items (yet I chose to run naked :P ) - you can buy them to have them permanently and equipped upon respawn if you wanna feel e d g yVehicles: 3 types of 5-seats, 3- and 2-man motorcycles, a 2-seat buggy and a boat. A bus and a truck would be cool for trolling (=having fun with friends) :) Again, you have enough choice. Whether to drive a fast yet dangerious motorbike or go for a safe off-road choice - the UAZ.The map is well-designed and allows for a plentora of strategic and gameplay choices.3) Insanely addictiveIt's like casino. You die in a round and hope the next try to be better. Just can't stop playing. Reminds me of CSGO4) Have it your way™Wanna have action all time? Drop out at school, military base, Georgopol or the "Home City Po♥♥♥♥♥i". You will meet at least 5-15 other batshit crazy bois to fight with!On the other hand, are you playing to WIN?! We've got you covered: From standalone houses to small villages on the outskirts of the map. You choose whether you find a vehicle and drive to the edge of the circle to avoid meeting anyone else there. On the other hand, do you feel mad? Camp the bridge or houses, blend in with bushes and play the Bushwookie, or even play SOLO in Squad matches!You are only limited by your imagination. Running people over is also hilarious!5) Spiritual successor to Arma/Battleroyale modFrom controls, bullet drop simulation and sounds. As an Arma veteran, I learned to love it. (1000+ hrs in Arma2) It just feels familiar. You can look around by turning your head (Left ALT), the bullets actually travel the flight distance - you must adjust the scope zeroing and compensate for your target's movement speed. It's the tasteful pinch of realism the game needs.======-1) The utter lack of any optimisationThere're NO EXCUSES. The "it's playable" is not a valid excuse. Do you expect everyone to possess a supercomputer in order to run the game?CPU: The only good news is that it computes in parallel threads, making use of multi-core CPUs unlike Arma. The bad news is, you need a current high-end or overclocked mid-end CPU to run at 50+ FPS. We're talking 200+€ for the CPU alone, not your entire crap-PC. Here, I'd happily remind you, that currently a properly overclocked Ryzen CPU is the best performance/price you can get.GPU: If you want to be able just to run the game at lowest settings, I suggest at least a mid-end 2-3 year old GPU. 2 GB VRAM is the minimum. On high settings... 600€ for the GPU? Something along those lines...RAM: Absolute minimum 8GB RAM installed, not 6GB as stated. You'll need to close everything in the background. PUBG definitely has memory leaks and consumes 8-11 GB of RAM easily after a few matches on my system. With 12-16 GB you'd be entering the comfortable zone.-2) BUG-GFor a long time there were various bugs and exploits. For example completely broken physics where 2 vehicles would glue to each other and not able to be moved. Players could, for a long time, fall/glitch under the map and swim in the endless ocean until the end zone. They have finally completely fixed it at the end of August so that those players are ported to a location above the map. It took them "just" 3 months or so...Another thing that bugs me is the clearly broken 4x ACOG scope. The shots are going nowhere near the scope marker, it's zeroing is broken differently for different weapons. Have fun aiming with that.-3) Broken main menuMinecraft was "early access" and had bugs. But there's the difference: Minecraft didn't have bugs is the ** MAIN MENU! The developer has introduced a "refresh" button in the main menu to reload it for whenever it fails. And it does more often than not. Are you serious?! THEY CAN'T FIX THE FRIGGING MAIN MENU OF THE GAME. IT'S THE FIRST THING A PLAYER SEES!Almost everytime I exit a match and load the main menu, the server switches from Europe to Australia. Do you imagine how funny it is to notice this in the middle of the ongoing match? I can't imagine what'd you need to do as a developer to create this bug. I am not alone here with this issue. -4) OLD: Poor controls/visual feedbackAt first you'll think that there're a ton of possibilities regarding keyboard settings. That's true, you can not only set a hotkey for almost everything but also set the toggle/hold binds according to your preferences. It's indeed awesome. Yet there is one exception: you cannot set how the aiming modes are handled. There are 3 types of scoping: no aim/aimed in/scoped in. The "aimed in" mode provides a little better accuracy while maintaining the central crosshair and is enabled by holding the RMB. For "scoped in" you need to click RMB. Some people, including me, would like to swap that behaviour, but it's not possible.Well surely, it's not the end of the world, however PUBG is now attempting to get into e-sports too. In this category of games it's unacceptable to have "whacky" mouse controls - each pixel counts. After having played 1400+ hours of CSGO I surely have a feeling for my mouse and the mouse pointer. I'm not saying that PUBG is not allowed to have a different mouse cursor handling (it's another engine anyhow) but the mouse control feels weirdly smoothed or delayed/limited compared to other titles. Common sense dictates that you can't do a 360 turn in real life in no time, however in e-sports any kind of mouse adjustment or limitation is a severe problem since it violates consistency. It's a problem that must be addressed.-5) You will become hearing-impaired after visiting the spawn islandThat's simply a funny point, nothing serious ^_^ The gun shots and screaming teenagers are extremely annoying on the spawn island. Luckily there're hotkeys to mute in-game sound and voice chat, CTRL+M and CTRL+T correspondingly.-/+6) bans for stream sniping controversyRead up the stories and make up your own mind.- Continue reading in comments ...

ZEN9TH	Not Recommended	617.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZEN9TH/	WHOOO, Here we go. 570 Hours into the game and here I am finally writing a review. I honestly have no clue where to start with this game so I'll just start off with the pros, as unfortunately the cons heavily outweigh them. PROS  General Concept For being one of the first of its kind PUBG's battle royale concept is a great one. For anyone who loved classic deathmatch games, the battle royale mechanics in PUBG provide an extremely enjoyable experience; Every moment is intense, multitasking is crucial, and stacking up your kills is always your primary goal. With 100 players fighting in a constantly shrinking area, the game provides intense, adrenaline fueled gameplay which can be entertaining for hours. Graphics The realistic graphics in PUBG are great and look beautiful, while also providing the player with a great sense of immersion. There is a relatively good amount of detail that again makes the game all the more immersive. Even though today the game's graphics are a bit demanding the Bluehole team has made them more compatible throughout the game's development, and continue to do so. Online PUBG is a big enough game that finding and joining a game is a quick process. The game's connectivity issues have been smoothed out overtime and as long as you have a ping under 100, online play is crisp and delay free.I wish I had more positive notes to give, but unfortunately this is where we talk about the issues with the game.  CONS  Gameplay Even though the concept of PUBG is a great one as previously mentioned, the gameplay is disappointing to say the least and does not at all live up to the greatness of the game's concept. The gameplay heavily relies on RNG (Random Number Generator) systems and thus lacks in consistency, making the game itself more based off of a player's luck as opposed to a player's skill. The game also has an astronomically large amount of bugs and glitches that can chip away heavily at gameplay experience. Pair these two major issues together and you get a game that is almost the equivalent of a rigged slot machine. Playerbase PUBG's playerbase is a bit of an iffy subject. While playing with other players in Duos and Squads can generally be a pleasant experience, there are times when you will be grouped with players who do not communicate, either because they don't intend to or because they literally can't due to language barriers. Apart from that the game still suffers from a large amount of hackers, and even though Bluehole is trying at getting rid of them they still diminish gameplay experience for many users who encounter them. Developer Incompetence I honestly don't know where to start with this one. While PUBG originally started out as a promising multiplayer battle royale game, PLAYERUNKNOWN and Bluehole have managed to pull off a complete 180 and screw up anything that made the game enjoyable in the first place.  Ever since Fortnite took the podium as the 1# battle royale game, Bluehole and PLAYERUNKNOWN have became extremely bitter towards Epic Games and every other battle royale game currently on the market. While the game started out with the developers trying to be creative and add new features while also improving the game's quality, they now spend less time improving and creating and more time trying to figure out how to make more money. Since the game's popularity has been falling they've been trying to claw their way back into the spotlight by hosting Esports events and sponsoring internet celebrities. And through all of this mess they decided to stop listening to their community, the people that actually gave them the success they currently have. As of now they see their community as drones that will freely hand over as much money as they can leech out of them. Until they get their act together and straighten out their priorities, I can't recommend buying PUBG, or any game that either PLAYERUNKNOWN or Bluehole publishes for that matter. Closing While PUBG may be a thrilling and fun game to play, I can't honestly recommend it because it simply isn't worth the money or the time. While one may get a somewhat enjoyable experience out of it, it's various flaws, inconsistencies, and developer immaturity make the game frankly, not worth investing in. Score  3/10  -ZEN9TH

This developer only cares about making money (and they have made insane amount compared to what it probably took to make this POS game). Every patch adds more loot chests, cosmetics and other garbage for kids to waste their parents money on. And the "free" loot boxes are almost always locked and require you to pay $2+ to open each one.Everytime they add something new it is poorly tested and riddled with bugs. All they want is your money.

Uncle Basil	Not Recommended	163.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/	Great idea, terrible execution. One of the worst netcodes in popular mutiplayer games, cheaters in almost every match, lack of optimisation and bugs that can ruin your match (like getting stuck on a parachute or being launched into the stratosphere while riding a bike) oh and microtransactions, of course (yes, they are cosmetic. But this is not a free-to-play game and in the end, getting the rarest cosmetic items is one of the end goals of the game). It's debatable but likely that the cheater problem is not being resolved by the developer because the game economy is dependent on things staying like they are, with huge numbers of players cheating to win as fast as possible, get crates and sell their contents. Game could be something great, but it's buried in issues. Only fun for messing around with your friends, if you're looking for a fair but challenging game, this is not it.

Cactus 86	Not Recommended	504.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cactusjonesbagel/	Alright listen up here.  I have been playing this game from it's initial release and can confirm it is the best battle royale game out there.  In PUBG players with advanced tactics have a pretty big advantage over brainless morons who just rush around with weapons.  This is due to the fact that the game starts pretty slow because to become fully kitted you need many things. Anyways you probably know how the game works already so let me get the part you want to hear.  In its current state, this game is complete trash.  Previous updates I loved this game and had a ton of fun.  Ever since the first person update this game has been buggier than ever and filled with just awful vulgar players.  You used to be able to get into a game of PUBG on the North American server and have a few people talking cracking jokes.  Now the game is just filled with "China number 1" and the likes.  Over 50% of the PUBG player base are Chinese people.  Now listen, I am not racist but the fact that someone jumps into the North American server and the only English words they know are curse words it really ruins the purpose of voice chat.  I have had to turn off all talk because of the stupid and annoying players.  You either have someone spamming music, someone who can't speak English speaking as loud as they can, or you have some dumbass American screaming the N word.Part 2:  There are so many f*cking hackers right now I suggest you not buy the game.  I find it very hard to get into a game where there is not a hacker.  It is bad when you are getting shot from 700 meters+ consistantly right in the head.  I cannot even get a game anymore that doesn't have hackers in it.  I have been playing the game since the beginning and it has never been as bad as it is now.  If you are planning on buying the game I would advise you wait until the next update.Part 3: In game bugs.  The game is buggier than it has ever been excluding the first person update.  That update was horrid.  Right before first person my friends and I all had really good frame-rates and would rarely lag.  The dev team seems to have quit caring about the PC version because now they are getting ready for the Xbox release.  Most of my friends cannot even load in buildings for about 15 second right when the game starts.  This prevents my teams and I from dropping into any hot zones thus ruining many of the effects of the game.  Unless you have a beastly PC I would recommend you wait until a later date to buy this game.All in all:  Wait until this game gets fixed because right now it is borderline unplayable.Edit: Hackers have been removed and the new update looks promising.

King Cole	Not Recommended	191.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoodKingCole/	PUBG is what happens when you have a good concept for a game executed by mediocre developers. Bugs, absurd amounts of hackers, terrible optimization, and GREED. The loot box crates were a sign of things to come, and their inclusion in a 30 dollar game rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It got worse though, as they just kept adding them and now have introduced a battle pass similar to Fortnite's, but worse because FORTNITE IS FREE. Blueball's knows the game is gonna die compared to the heights it was once at, and will try to suck every last cent out of it they can over the course of the next year. Disgusting. They aren't a talented enough studio with a good enough game to be this greedy.

Kenotonic	Not Recommended	278.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006181534/	This is by far one of the WORST games I have ever played. I strongly advise you to TRIPLE think your decision of buying this game. Over half of the population in PUBG are cheaters. Speed hacking, aim botting, God mode, you name it it's in here. Company statistics even show 1 in every 3 games you will encounter a hacker. 13k accounts banned per day due to hacking. Aside from the unbearable unfairness of that aspect alone, the lag in this game is beyond unacceptable. Every game you will lag gaurenteed when you drop in. Guns won't load, enemies won't load, horrendous rubber banding and so much more. The amount of glitches and bugs in this fully released game is enough to make you bald with frustration. The enjoyment of the game relies entirely on RNG. Basically, very few times will you actually truly enjoy playing this game. Even the CEO of this company announced that their main concerns about the game comes AFTER profits. Let that sink in. Your money is more important than the integrity of the game. All in all enjoyment can still be found in PUBG but it's incredibly hard to find it. I do not recommend this game to anyone.

Without purchasing the "event pass" obtaining any skins is now impossible because they limit you to getting 80 XP a day w/out missions, when it requires 400 XP just to get to the first level! i would strongly advise against ever purchasing this game.

A few hours ago they were free, now they give you a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t credits and now force you to pay to open stuff. Wtf are they doing? First your stupid game isnt fully release and has bugs left right and center and now the little bit of reward you get from it, they decide to take that from you. God damn early access games, give your god damn head a shake!
King Cole	Not Recommended	191.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GoodKingCole/	PUBG is what happens when you have a good concept for a game executed by mediocre developers. Bugs, absurd amounts of hackers, terrible optimization, and GREED. The loot box crates were a sign of things to come, and their inclusion in a 30 dollar game rubbed a lot of people the wrong way. It got worse though, as they just kept adding them and now have introduced a battle pass similar to Fortnite's, but worse because FORTNITE IS FREE. Blueball's knows the game is gonna die compared to the heights it was once at, and will try to suck every last cent out of it they can over the course of the next year. Disgusting. They aren't a talented enough studio with a good enough game to be this greedy.

Uncle Basil	Not Recommended	163.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/basil698/	Great idea, terrible execution. One of the worst netcodes in popular mutiplayer games, cheaters in almost every match, lack of optimisation and bugs that can ruin your match (like getting stuck on a parachute or being launched into the stratosphere while riding a bike) oh and microtransactions, of course (yes, they are cosmetic. But this is not a free-to-play game and in the end, getting the rarest cosmetic items is one of the end goals of the game). It's debatable but likely that the cheater problem is not being resolved by the developer because the game economy is dependent on things staying like they are, with huge numbers of players cheating to win as fast as possible, get crates and sell their contents. Game could be something great, but it's buried in issues. Only fun for messing around with your friends, if you're looking for a fair but challenging game, this is not it.

This developer only cares about making money (and they have made insane amount compared to what it probably took to make this POS game). Every patch adds more loot chests, cosmetics and other garbage for kids to waste their parents money on. And the "free" loot boxes are almost always locked and require you to pay $2+ to open each one.Everytime they add something new it is poorly tested and riddled with bugs. All they want is your money.

Hoopy Frood Jay	Not Recommended	1,629.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198114637337/	Okay, so after 1.000 hours of playtime, I' gonna give my review.The idea behind the game is very good and addictive, so addictive in fact, that it took me less than a year to get to a thousand hours in-game. With that said, I wouldn't recommend the game, if you're looking for a "fair fight" or a game that is highly determined by players' skill. Skill of course helps, sure, but there is just SO much luck involved in winning early and late game fights. Early game is pretty much a coin flip. It often comes down to if you find a decent weapon quickly. Late game you need some luck with the zone, but good movement and smart decisions are a factor, too. In general, there is too much luck involved for this game to become an E-Sport in my opinion. Look, all the big popular E-Sports are solely skill-based and have little to no "luck factor".Another hot topic for me is how the devs handle their game. The game STILL has countless bugs, crashes and glitches that hinder a nice experience. Some of them have been prevalent for more than half a year, but are still not fixed. But for the devs it seemed to be much more important to push the game out of early access and implement microtransactions rather than releasing a polished product. And why the heck is there no skill-based matchmaking? Matching bad playrers (K/D below 1) against aim-gods seems unneccessarily unfair. Some matchmaking based on the K/D or killrating would be very welcome. Maybe that way, cheaters would end up playing against cheaters, who knows...By the way, regions should be locked completely. Not only China, but all of 'em. Every region gets to play on their respective servers without the option to choose other servers. TL;DR: wait till the devs get their♥♥♥♥♥♥together or until it is on sale.

Yokamota	Not Recommended	82.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198329245745/	PUBG is a fun game, but it is not a good game.The game itself is only fun to play if you already have a couple hours of playing it. On the very first of you play, you don't have to do the tutorial, those are for casual, find how the game works as you play it, with every time you die, you will learn something from it, different idea to play the game, different strategies. It is fun, yes it is. Especially when you play with your friends. Its undeniable.PUBG got so much good potential but idk why but they just can't bring those potential to life and give us a good experience.The game itself is broken from the inside, if you have a potato internet and PC I suggest don't even try this game, because in my experience, in any resolution or texture I play the game only give me 30-50 or less fps. But the choices are all yours. If you up to play countless dead, and wanna eat some chicken at the end with maximum effort its all yours. Or you just wanna kill those guys with weapon you like from the game, or you just wanna be the guy that survive without even try to take those weapon because you are 'pacifist'.For me, the gameplay is okay but if you not really good at it, its not that fun. And it take so much time to them to add another mode in PUBG. The server is .. well, it's actually better than couple months ago, but it's still not good. And it really irritates me that game optimization is really horrible.

Kenotonic	Not Recommended	278.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006181534/	This is by far one of the WORST games I have ever played. I strongly advise you to TRIPLE think your decision of buying this game. Over half of the population in PUBG are cheaters. Speed hacking, aim botting, God mode, you name it it's in here. Company statistics even show 1 in every 3 games you will encounter a hacker. 13k accounts banned per day due to hacking. Aside from the unbearable unfairness of that aspect alone, the lag in this game is beyond unacceptable. Every game you will lag gaurenteed when you drop in. Guns won't load, enemies won't load, horrendous rubber banding and so much more. The amount of glitches and bugs in this fully released game is enough to make you bald with frustration. The enjoyment of the game relies entirely on RNG. Basically, very few times will you actually truly enjoy playing this game. Even the CEO of this company announced that their main concerns about the game comes AFTER profits. Let that sink in. Your money is more important than the integrity of the game. All in all enjoyment can still be found in PUBG but it's incredibly hard to find it. I do not recommend this game to anyone. If you are looking for a battle royale type game I advise playing Fortnite over this piece of trash.

The Firebrand	Not Recommended	377.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the-firebrand/	PROS:- You don't have to rely on teammates. You can play solo or with one to three other friends with equal competitive chances. - Decent graphics.CONS: - Broken promises from developers. Little to no updates. Each update breaks the game further.- Microtransactions since Early Access: Same crate gambling model as CS:GO but in a full-priced game. A darn skirt costs as much as ten copies of the game. The new 'premium pass' (June 2018) seems to be a total grindfest cashgrab.- In-game advertisements in the form of wall graffiti with famous real-world brand names or even in-menu ISP advertising for Chinese users. - Permanent lag. The game's network runs on a 17Hz at its best, being even worse at the start of the game. Often times the loot won't have even spawned after you've landed. Bullet hits sometimes do not register and the system favours players with higher ping as they can peek you without you being able to see them or they can kill you long after you've gone behind cover because they still see you out in the open. [Edit: This issue has been addressed.]- Literally clunkier movement than games in the early 2000s. You need to rely on difficult to execute 'crouch jump' tricks to be able to jump over the smallest fence. Even the tiniest, invisible rock can flip your vehicle over and cost you the game. [Edit: There's now a 'vaulting mechanic' that allows you to jump over fences and some windows. It's still incredibly clunky.]- Constant crashes whether you're launching the game, in a lobby, or clutching an end-game victory. - Myriad of game-breaking bugs including buildings not rendering for some players so they can see through the walls. - Game favours players with lower graphic settings. Players can disable shadows, even grass to see their enemies better.- Heavily luck-based looting and positioning system throughout the whole match.- Very badly optimized for low-end machines.- Devs care more about twitch streamers and advertising than the actual player base. Players would randomly get banned for "stream sniping" even those who don't even watch streams as streamers can simply cry to devs about getting killed in-game with no evidence of other players watching their streams and get them banned.- TONS of hackers in the game, especially since in-game crate drops can be sold on the marketplace, there's immense amounts of Chinese hackers (or even teaming groups) that infest the lobbies. Within a 100 player game there's bound to be hackers. And if you want to win, you'll have to defeat them somehow. Difficult when there's obvious aimbotters and wall-hackers.
<none>	Not Recommended	154.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bios01/	I really like playing this game, no matter how much stress it causes me. But I have a very big issue, NA servers. I either have two choices, play with players that can zoom across the map, shoot across the map through walls and grounds, basically, a cheater infested mess(as of the recent update, they're implementing more anti-cheat measures, a good step, recovery takes time, but this Chinese invasion of NA servers is still very present), or play on EU servers or others with 200+ ping and be at a consistent disadvantage. The devs do not actually care for the player base, too, evidence is that they added in crates in the game-when promised they will not have them until after early access, they ran advertisements on Chinese clients on PUBG for a VPN service (source), then Player unknown (AKA Brendan Greene) has the audicity to call his player base as 'xenophobics' for saying that Chinese players are causing a problem, which if you think playing in server where more than half the players have above 500 ping in a FPS game(along with statistics from their anti-cheat system saying majority of banned players are chinese-source), then I'm not sure of what to tell you. I don't recommend this game until the devs get a sense on how to treat their consumers, obviously they do not care at all because, well, we're already giving them money so why should they? Unless their source of money starts to fade, they'll stay in this area of "Who really cares about the consumers? They'll pay us for anything at this point, the idiots." type of mindset. It hurts me to think that Player Unknown kind of sees us (Not definite, but deduction of given evidence) this way, but you can't hope for problems to be fixed if you don't attempt much. It's a fun game, I enjoy it. I don't recommend more people to get this game though, try the alternatives first and see if you like this style of a game, and maybe wait until the PUBG corp shows that they really do care for us.You can search my points I made and there should be articles that I originated them from.I most likely made some errors in logic or grammar.*edited an error in parantheses and replaced a statement

Diamond Owlie	Recommended	416.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PSBOwlie/	I will not be too picky, the game reminded me everyone of the famous DayZ.The main difference between PUBG and DayZ is the dynamics. Pubg is just several times superior to DayZ in speed of luting / resource collection / trauma / movement treatment and only for this. This game is for those who love PvP in games, where death means the loss of all equipment, but at the same time it does not like the process of tyrannous looting.Here everything happens lightning fast: while you are running around in the next house you manage to glue the fins of ~ 20 players out of 100, when you finally find the human equipment that you like, the half of the server will die out already. That's where the most interesting part of the game begins, well, you can appreciate it watching different videos or streams, my review was created only to warn you or encourage you to buy this product.Let's start with the cons:Early access you pay for a game that has not even gone to beta, let alone release.Graphic arts. The game does not shine with graphics, but eyes from the eye sockets do not flow, you want graphics - buy Battlefield 1, the whole problem is that you can not just take and tweak the settings to the maximum, because it's fraught with arson of your CPU and video card.Optimization is the eternal problem of such games. In Pubg, this is mainly expressed by a "network delay," which does not allow you to move when the game considers you "pawned." I think that mention of problems with some textures and the registration of hits worthy of mention.Proceed to the pluses of the game:The dynamics of the game process surpasses competitors from the genre of "survival".The game can fuel sports interest.Developers try to release updates as often as possible, with the last update I managed to get the top 1 twice.Ability to play with a whole bunch of friends (the team can fit up to 4 friends).A lot of fun and not so many moments.A great time killer, especially when there are companions. Summarize. The game is really worth attention and tries to stand out among the crowd of similar "survival" in early access, with which Steam is already full.Is it worth a thousand wooden ones?-I think that if you buy a game during any discount campaign, you will not lose it. Thank you for attention!

DarthSalty_The_Wise	Not Recommended	618.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010556624/	I have put in quite a few hours into this game. Conceptually, i love it, getting that chicken dinner is one of the most satisfying feelings that you can get playing a video game. That has all come to an end however, and the management of this game is currently in a state of neglect bordering on idiocy. Chinese players are the dominant group on EVERY server, not just asia. Because most only speak chinese, it is now almost impossible to play a team game if you are queueing up alone, or with an unfull premade. Not only this, but they bring with them an aspect of their culture that it is somehow acceptable to cheat, and is simply considered a part of the game.This... Is... Bullsh*t. Many players have been asking to #RegionLockChina for a long time now, but Brendan Greene has refused to acknowledge the fact that this once amazing game is being ruined for nearly everyone else and has instead opted to turn this incident into some sort of social justice case. Battleye is banning an incredible amount of hackers, its true, but this is just the tip of the iceberg, i personally have just played three games in a row, all of which i have been (definitely) killed by a hacker. Whatever they are doing, it is not enough, as this game is no longer enjoyable at all and instead only makes me angry every time I attempt to play it.tldr: End this nonsense, get off your moral high-horse and Region Lock China. It's the only viable solution at this point.

Even a daily log in rewards system with 1-2 keys a week would work in my opinion.The biggest slap in the face however is the new levelling system.YOU HAVE TO PAY $10USD to actually recieve levelling rewards?!?!?!?! for a game I have already paid $40 AUSD to play.You also can't claim mission completion rewards without paying for the pass.What a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.With the massive amount of battle royale games being released, you'd think the Devs would want to reward their playerbase, not spit in their faces.The Devs seem focussed on rapidly adding things to the cash store while their game remains plagued with hackers and bugs.

We're talking about Bluehole here.You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:In game purchases.It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do? More platforms.Not only that none of the platforms performed remotely well, they completely ignored that fact and started working on more crates and more in-game purchases.Since I could go about this all day long, and considering I'm actually rating a game here and not it's thirsty developer, I'll focus on it now:Pros:- Fast queue times due to high player-base,- SOLID graphics.- Good ballistics (Sniper and AR bullet drop)Cons:- Fully released game with performance of an early-alpha game.- HACKERS, HACKERS EVERYWHERE! My God, I've played so many games, but I've never encountered a game with so many hackers in it. Nearly every game contains at least 2-3 hackers, which at this point don't even try hiding it. Bluehole is doing nothing to fix this issue despite saying they are. Over the time, I've seen NO improvements in this domain.- Countless game breaking bugs (getting killed by nothing when vaulting, getting stuck in thin air while landing resulting in getting killed, reloading sometimes doesn't reload your weapon at all resulting in getting killed...)- HORRIBLE performance issues (High end PC users can be happy if they hit constant 60fps on medium-high settings at all times)- Hilarous netcode. So many instances when you get killed by someone who didn't even have a line of sight, constant stuttering, 60%+ fail rate of reconnecting to the game in case of a disconnect.- Horrible bullet detection system (this one mostly affects Shotguns)- ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ level design. This one is a great issue mostly focused on the Miramar map. They forced a new map which is massive in terms of size, but ironically has least content, least quality looting area, a MASSIVE LACK of vehicles considering the proportions of the map (mostly resulting in you playing a running simulator for about 20 minutes and ending up getting killed by someone who had luck with the initial safe zone). Even though the original map is better, they still need to prevent bridge camping which makes the game impossible if you had bad luck with initial looting and safe zone.- Performance bugs and glitches. Here, I don't aim for graphics and design glitches, I am talking about glitches which straight-up make you lose games. For instance, since the latest patch, I can no longer run for more than 3 seconds without my character stopping for no obvious reason. (And no, this isn't caused by my internet connection or my PC, it's a common issue nowadays) - I will stop with Cons for now since there's only so much time I can waste on this review. But yes, there are way more.################Bottom line, if you haven't already bought this game: DO NOT. Save your money. There are better alternatives if you're just taking up a new game, and they're even free to play. They don't have some of the mechanics PUBG has, and that's a shame, but at least they're optimized. Keep in mind that this game requires over the average PC to even be able to start the game, let alone play it properly.MESSAGE TO THE DEVELOPERS:If by any chance SOME of the brainiacs with influence in development actually take time and look through reviews for constructive criticism: Stop bullying Epic Games just because they did a better game than you did. How can you be such sore losers if your business logic is to sue someone just for delivering a better product?Instead of suing them, focus on your own game. You wouldn't lose any players if you just fixed your god damn game. I tried playing Fortnite, and I disliked it, but I am going to quit PUBG if things don't change, as I'm no longer able to enjoy the game. It's common sense that just one guy ranting here wont mean a thing to you, but I'm just one of the many who share this opinion. If anything, WE should be the ones getting compensated from YOU for failing to deliver a proper product which we paid for. Just imagine buying a Ferrari (Which you probably did with the money which obviously wasn't poured into additional development) and you're presented with a Ferrari which runs on a Prius engine. You'd obviously be mad as hell and demand your money back...This is not a dead game yet, there's still time to fix it, but not the way you're running things.

Diamond Owlie	Recommended	416.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PSBOwlie/	I will not be too picky, the game reminded me everyone of the famous DayZ.The main difference between PUBG and DayZ is the dynamics. Pubg is just several times superior to DayZ in speed of luting / resource collection / trauma / movement treatment and only for this. This game is for those who love PvP in games, where death means the loss of all equipment, but at the same time it does not like the process of tyrannous looting.Here everything happens lightning fast: while you are running around in the next house you manage to glue the fins of ~ 20 players out of 100, when you finally find the human equipment that you like, the half of the server will die out already. That's where the most interesting part of the game begins, well, you can appreciate it watching different videos or streams, my review was created only to warn you or encourage you to buy this product.Let's start with the cons:Early access you pay for a game that has not even gone to beta, let alone release.Graphic arts. The game does not shine with graphics, but eyes from the eye sockets do not flow, you want graphics - buy Battlefield 1, the whole problem is that you can not just take and tweak the settings to the maximum, because it's fraught with arson of your CPU and video card.Optimization is the eternal problem of such games. In Pubg, this is mainly expressed by a "network delay," which does not allow you to move when the game considers you "pawned." I think that mention of problems with some textures and the registration of hits worthy of mention.Proceed to the pluses of the game:The dynamics of the game process surpasses competitors from the genre of "survival".The game can fuel sports interest.Developers try to release updates as often as possible, with the last update I managed to get the top 1 twice.Ability to play with a whole bunch of friends (the team can fit up to 4 friends).A lot of fun and not so many moments.A great time killer, especially when there are companions. Summarize. The game is really worth attention and tries to stand out among the crowd of similar "survival" in early access, with which Steam is already full.Is it worth a thousand wooden ones?-I think that if you buy a game during any discount campaign, you will not lose it. Thank you for attention!

I just agree with it so much i felt it needed to be thrown at devs.Credit goes to Boltwire:I've encountered this game just like 99,9% of it's player-base did, by watching Twitch streams and youtube videos.Being something relatively new in the multiplayer scene (THAT ACTUALLY HAD A MASSIVE PLAYER-BASE), I managed to talk few of my friends into playing it.I'm not going to lie, we've spent hundreds of hours on it.That was until the official release of 1.0Keep in mind that we're talking about previously most played game in the world at some point, a game which brought it's developers millions (if not 10 digit numbers), and as any sane person, you'd expect that it will be poured into further development and fixes, right?LOL wrong. We're talking about Bluehole here.You really have to be next level special in order to stumble upon a gold mine, and then proceed to blow it up and cave it in. They had everything, massive FREE ADVERTISEMENT (NOTE: FREE > NOT REQUIRED TO PAY FOR) in a form of Twitch streamers and YouTube content creators, insane ACTIVE player-base, a product that's close to being 1.0 ready... Everything.They got money, they got everything. And what do they do?:In game purchases.It's disgusting seeing that someone who had all the foundation required to make a masterpiece ignore all that and just attempts to drain more money from players.They rushed the 1.0 to be able to implement in-game purchases, and instead of actually WORKING on it, what do they do?

All my gaming time goes into this and trust me it is worth it.From the moment of forming squad and you start a game, to the moment when you are in the top 5.The thrill keeps on increasing, the nerves start getting to you, it's all about how well can you deal with it.The teamwork, gamesense, awareness, and every single thing any other game has ever taught you, you will need it here.And man, don't get me started on how rewarding the game is, the feeling of surviving at the end and winning or carrying your team to victory, no other game has never given me such adrenaline.I have had so many moments laughing, having fun and a lot more with shaky hands trying to clutch at the end, and all of this has been worth it, worth more than what I paid for.Would buy again. 11/10. 
Twitch StijnTV	Not Recommended	656.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StinoTheBaws/	Bought this game while still in Early Acces back in March. I was so addicted to this game and I used to absolutely love it. Of course it had it's bugs etc. but at this moment some things just feel absolutely worse. A first big problem is the server lagg which makes me instantly quit but next to that the new map release wasn't that fun as I expected. I feel that the map is too big which results in too less action. You will get some occasional action but if you don't feel like running around for 10 minutes in between kills this won't be for you. Back on the first map 'Erangel' I encountered people so often what made it a lot more fun for me. I'm writing this on day of 1.0 release when desert map is like 90 percent of the time. I hope things change for the better in the future.

Sneaky... Behave!	Not Recommended	40.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SneakyJunky/	I bought it around February 2018 for $15 (regional pricing). The honest to god truth is that a friend of mine convinced me to buy it with the following pitch: "You will get back what you spent buying it by selling the weekly crate drops on the community market". True, I never opened anything and got my money back quickly.I've got a mid tier rig, this game demands a quantum computer. Playing with everything on low and getting the ocassional stutter. No thanks, I'm not one of those dudes that tweaks settings to get 3 extra FPS.  I played 40 hrs. I think I'm done with it. I did have fun. But I can't recommend something that is so poorly optimized.

PowerMax	Not Recommended	211.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/powermaxgr/	BAD DEVS-They banned a guy for steam sniping. Since when is this bannable? They famous streamer decided to stream his game all around the world publically and a guy got banned for honking around him. Now, if that makes sense to you, you can apply to be a pubg dev.-They promised that they wouldnt add microtransactions but guess what, they are removing free crates and add paid-only crates. This game sold 5 million copies (30 euro each), so that shows only greediness. I know that those microtransactions dont involve changes in the quality of gaming, but the reason I am highlighting this move is that the devs straight up LIED. And you know when a mature man lies he is probably gonna do it again, right?-These guys know that the game lacks optimization but focused on adding crates and more "content". People are complaining that sometimes buildings dont load until 1-2 or even 5 minutes after landing and this issue still hasnt been solved.Dont get me wrong, I like the concept/idea of this game and these devs are not the worst out there. They banned a streamer for intentionally teamkilling and finally added an ingame report system, but there is something called PRIORITIES. Its 2k17 dammit, learn from the mistakes that Dayz and many other early access games did, because even though you already got the money, who says that the people will follow you on your next game if you continue like that?

They have no interest in fixing glitches or making the game better or even giving the player ANYTHING positive.The game is not good enough and the monetisation is shameful garbage.

MîçħæŁ	Not Recommended	109.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Michael7291/	The game was great during it's early access and so full of promise and a lot of fun.Todays version however I can't even call it fun. The game feels more broken than when it first started. Nearing the release of their second map and the Vaulting / climbing ability update the game just stopped making progress at all.They instead spent most their time making loot boxes and then adding another map later down the line instead of fixing problems that already existed in the game ontop of that hackers/cheaters became more and more of a problem until it reached the point you will encounter 1 or 2 hackers every 8 of 10 games you may play.It became clear with more and more lootboxes being worked on and some being aimed at streamers plus then sueing another company for copying them when the concept of battle royal isn't original to Bluehole/PUBGCorp, all they truely care about is money. Not what the community wants or probably even wanting to make this game good either.To really add to their already ruined reputation they added a £7.49  ($9.94) Event pass for the upcoming Sanhok map which comes with Premuim loot. "We get premuim loot?" Oh... well don't get too excited because it's not yours to keep, there's an expiration timer once you open the items. The map itself is not exclusive either. It will be released to all players at an unstated date so you'il technically have paid for absolutely nothing.If you really think about it the structure they now have in place is basically that of a free to play game and I can think of far better free to play games to play than this game.Do yourself a very big favor and don't buy this game and if you're already unfortunate enough to own it, don't buy the event pass or any DLC they may bring out.With all that being said I think I'll reward myself with a real chicken dinner.
G2	Not Recommended	434.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shaddap/	Devs need to focus less on continual cash grabs, and more on client optimisation, bug fixes, and gameplay improvements. Although the game has come a long way in these areas, it still feels like Early Access because there's still so far to go. PUBG certainly deserves respect for really launching Battle Royale games, but in a couple of years there's no way that it will retain the title of best or most popular BR game. Concept is great, but the execution could be improved by so much.

4P`	Not Recommended	141.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/alexp/	This game is G A R B A G E. First, lets start off with the fact that they do NOT review reports for bans. If you are reported, you will be banned without review and with no offical evidence behind their claims. Played 3 matches, logged off and go to log back on less than 24 hours later and I get a message stating I was banned. You reach out to their god awful support team, and they basically copy and paste a message telling you they have no way to unban you or view the match in which you received your ban from.Secondly, this game is the biggest cash grab to date. The game just left early access and has been ported to Xbox One WITHOUT EVEN BEING OPTIMIZED. Instead of focusing on fixing the broken gameplay and bugs, they just roll out a new map, car tweaks (which breaks the vehicles even more than before), and throw in more weapons which result in even more bugs.

♥dankye♥	Not Recommended	60.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052380531/	Imma get straight to the point, save your money and get  Fortnite  Heres why PUBG sucks:  Major Con, extreme amounts of looting in this game makes the game stale When people play PUBG unfortunately they feel the need of having mods, gear, helmet, vest, meds and boosters in their inventory ARE necessary for their ability to play due to the wide variety of items and upgrades that can give you a mild advantage so naturally people want to take advantage of this and only engage when they have the right items which is fairly smart if you want to win however looking at the wide scope of things the amount of different items your going to want to have is huge for a battle royale game encouraging looting over fighting causing a stale gameplay experience.  For example  if someone goes into a building and finds an M16 with some ammo, instead running and gunning and actively fighting others they will pick it up and go "ok now I need a scope for it and a helmet and a vest and some meds and boosters and a stock and a silencer etc etc" and ONLY after they loot all these items they are ready to fight. So what you get is at the beginning of the game, unless you are an active running and gunning player with that kind of mindset you will get absolutely stale gameplay running across the map and looting which in my experience takes up about 80% of a match. Although looting is an important aspect of any battle royale game, the primary focus of the game should be actively fighting each other and not looting! Even 20-30 minutes in people are still going to be looting beacuse of the extra little upgrades you can still get such as a level 3 vest compared to your level 1 or a silencer instead of a compensator etc, the wide variety of different items and modifications you can get has made people specifically go for and want to loot even more thus how the game is intentionally or unintentially primarily focusing the looting aspect of PUBG and giving people this looting mindset of disengaging from fights and finding more loot makes a stale match. This is what makes PUBG boring, a hiding and running looting fest, the only parts of an average match which I genuinely find exciting and fun is either in the final few circles where everyone is out there to find and fight each other which I admit really does get my adrenaline pumping or at the very beginning, landing in a highly populated area where there is an active threat and looting takes as a secondary focus. Unfortunately these heart pumping moments where I feel like im scared for my life only take up no more than 20% of the game if youre lucky, the rest of it is a boring, stale, unexciting loot fest.  Heres why fortnite is superior The looting system and the way people play Fortnite is much simplier and honestly so much more fun. This is because of the lack of items people deem necesarry to fight with. The moment you land in fortnite and you see a green shotgun for example (a relatively common item in the game) is all you need and your good to go and can literally run and gun around the area and engage in killing people with no problem. Sure there are other items in the game that can come in handy but not nearly as much as you would need in PUBG as you dont necessarily need a shield potion for the early game or even possibly end game of fortnite at all as I've won many matches without it and meds dont have nearly as much of a severe impact on the game as in PUBG as typically fights are much more close ranged giving bandaging up in fights almost futile. All you need in fornite is a decent gun and youre okay, no silencers, no scopes, no armour pieces, no bullsh*t.This is what makes a battle royale game fun. Side Cons of PUBG compared to Fortnite -PUBG is notoriously poorly optimised, even players with good PC's exceeding the system requirements have unenjoyable performance issues. Fortnite runs perfectly if you meet the system requirements.-PUBG is $40 NZD compared to Fortnite being free Side Pros of PUBG -Biggest Battle Royale Game out there, huge community almost everyone owns it so it can be a good conversation starter for those awkward moments irl if the other person has played or even heard of PUBG (likely)  :)-Turning in a questionable Esport??-Made my money back from selling crates although I owned the game for a while now when the Gamescom Crates came out and selling the normal cases at a higher price soo-Hard to think of many more pro's and con's :P leave comments down below of any and I can easily edit this post :)

EUGENE.	Recommended	33.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZwartLiska/	In this review I'll cover some common aspects like the gameplay, graphics and other noteworthy things about this game. This is all from my personal point of view and experience.PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS, who hasn't heard of that title lately. Everyone plays it, and probably you too considering you're reading this review. It exploded in purchases all over the world in mere months.Essentially, PUBG is a "Battle Royale" game as they call it. Up to a hundred players enter the battlegrounds by plane. Once landed by parachute, they must find loot like weapons, equipment, ammunition and armor and must constantly be on the move for the shrinking active zone and the other players. The last man, duo or team standing wins. Far easier said than done... GameplayYou land, you loot, you kill, you win die, rinse and repeat. Your death is the end of the line. No respawn, no revive, no retry. Make a mistake and they'll drop you. No other gamemode. There's a constant being on the lookout feeling present and nowhere is safe. At times this adrenaline rush feels good, especially when you're doing well meanwhile. It's nice to move tactically and pick people off here and there whilst maintaining and communicating with your teammates (if any).The guns are also satisfying to use in both first- and thirdperson mode. They look and sound good, are fun to customize and always spark hope and thrill whenever you find a good one. The gunplay and tactics are enjoyable too. You can use various angles and assisting buttons to scan the area around you and peek around corners.However, I must address one major issue I have with this game and that is how extremely unsatisfying and droning it can be. There will be sessions where you do great and there will be sessions where you suck. The problem is that in many plays, especially your first few ones, you spend a lot of time looting up and moving, then dying out of nowhere. This truly happens a lot and there's not a single percent of satisfaction in this process. You go from house to house to assemble your gear and then you just die. No combat, no chance of retaliation, nothing. Only you and a grey screen with the "Exit to lobby" button laughing at you. Not even a playback clip of the player who killed you so that you can learn from your mistakes. You're on your own and progress takes a lot of time. Time that often feels wasted and like grinding because all (it seems) you do is move around, loot and die without making a single hit.Graphics/sound/optimizationWhile it can run fine (55-ish fps on normal-high, while I can run DOOM on ultra with 100 fps), putting it higher than that is a pain for most PCs, good ones included. Especially the random lags are annoying. It could really use some work on this area.The sound however is pretty okay. Especially the gunshots and sounds from far away are a nice touch to both the gameplay and the realism.Devs and streamersYou might be wondering what's up with the Mixed rating on this game (you can ignore most Mostly Positive ratings and below on popular games, it's usually people with way too high expectations about a game). The simple answer is the devs and streamers, mainly from Twitch.The devs of this game are banning players from their game for various inane reasons. Yes, an actual game ban, that ugly red text you see on certain Steam profiles. It's for reasons as insanely ridiculous as, for example, honking at a streamer who then reported the player who honked along the lines of harassment (lol), and he got banned.This isn't really an issue in the long run long if you just keep a low profile. Don't do anything risky like coarse cussing, teamkilling and apparently honking at streamers and you are good to go.I'm not really a guy to delve into the world of the devs behind games so if you want to know more about that I suggest you look at most of the recent negative reviews. I find this one a pretty good example: http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034965030/recommended/578080/Lastly, microtransactions. I get it, cheap way of earning money etc. but for three reasons it's really nothing bad at all: customizeable characters, trading items and it doesn't impact the gameplay in any way, so just stop complaining about it.Final wordIt's really not a bad game. It's rather addictive and I'm sure I'll keep playing it for a bit more with friends but ultimately I'm a little bit disappointed with how unsatisfying it can be as I mentioned earlier. If there was more satisfaction in losing instantly after a long period of nothingness, which there won't be, I'd be way more enthusiast about this game.I'd still like to see the price drop to 20 or so. 30 is a little too steep.
BingbongMcgee	Not Recommended	928.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048883344/	This game is fun. The game developer, PlayerUnkown will ban anyone a streamer declares a cheater or a stream sniper. Streams have huge audiences and encourage witch hunting and picking out an individual player without any clear evidence. You risk getting banned for killing a streamer, especially if that streamer is looking for an excuse to why they died because their head is so far up their butt they can't realize that they will die sometimes. Their careless accusations cost people that support this game their opprtunity to play. Garbage public relations and their developers are at the knees of streamers and their herds of sheep followers that witchunt and harass random players calle dout by streamers. Don't buy this game the developers are PR idiots.
Resort Kill	Not Recommended	37.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198241237666/	The game is fun, but the devs are♥♥♥♥♥♥ They don't care about the community and will enforce a zero tolerance policy when it comes to the rules of this game. A random in your squad TK's your 2 friends and tries killing you? You get banned for killing him in retaliation. Kill a player that's out in the middle of an open field after he shoots his gun? Get banned because that player was a big streamer and he cried 'stream-sniping' for dying. Try to appeal your case to the devs? Get told that you shouldn't have done what you did and then get banned from their discord chat so that you remain silenced. The devs are a ♥♥♥♥ing joke.
rebus_forever	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rebus_Forever/	Hey there, Rebus Forever here with another one minute-ish preview, this time it's the controversy ridden early access release that is PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds. Video review available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGxucuObgxkhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/RebusForeverReviews#curationDId you like Battle Royale?Do you like being killed but not knowing why? Do you like having to develop some god tier skills to consistently do well?Then this might be the game for you.  PlayerUnknown's sees you pitted against a wall of blue gradual death that stalks you across a huge open map you are free explore and bask in the scale of for the first 5 minutes of the match, after which the pursuing blue wall will politely hurry you along by slowly sucking your soul out should you dawdle.Apparently, so I've heard, there are other people in the game- but often my only source of this information is the post death screen that follows some sudden and untraceable gunfire. PlayerUnknown's is a Battle Royale style game- for anyone unfamiliar with the film, Battle Royale was a feel good rom com that followed the wacky misadventures of a dysfunctional class of school children and their hilarious former teacher on a school trip to the jungle.From there, it's the rom com staple of everyone being forced to kill one another- in this case with nothing more than a supplied backpack of random stuff and whatever they can scrounge- to hilarious and heartwarming effect; rinse and repeat til there is only one person left. PlayerUnknown's is essentially an unlicensed Eastern European themed version of that. The game can be played in a total FFA mode, and also in squads- if you know enough openly masochistic people.Each game of PlayerUnknown's begins with you waiting in the lobby area until it reaches capacity, during this time you are free to walk around and interact via voice chat with the other players, giving everybody a good opportunity to participate in civil discourse, wish one another the best of luck or exchange tips and advice.......Once the lobby fills the game begins.For some reason, the devs decided to begin the game with an American Airlines passenger simulator giving you the option to disembark the plane within a set time or removing you by other means if necessary. You begin empty-handed, once on the ground scavenging is the order of the day and then the killing or hiding begins in earnest. The map is huge, to prevent camping and force player interaction (see killing), the map begins shrinking in stages, if you chute down in the wrong place you may well find your only challenge for the game is staying inside the playable area. There is a wide variety of weapons and superficial items littered around with a number of vehicles also added to aid with mobility.Each game continues until there is only one player left. After each game, you earn some nonsense, game specific currency you can also spend real money on, that allows you to buy lootboxes that might contain a superficial item you might be interested in; the random, almost abusive nature of the loot purchase system, matches the feel of the gameplay perfectly.  (I spent all of my time in FFA mode for context.)I simultaneously enjoy PUBG, suck at it and think its a little over priced.The games performance is patchy- most of the time when I die I don't know why.I've only made it into the top 10 a handful of times, the devs are now apparently banning people for killing streamers with claims they are doing so without just cause, but if you can pick it up for half price sometime (and have the patience of a saint) PUBG might be the grieving engine for you.Thanks for checking my review!!

Literally no one will support them for suing a game just because it has the same genre and style of gameplay. Like jesus christ, are they that desperate to eliminate competition?

Here's why my boys:He recently cried because of fortnite BR because created by Epic games, the creator of UE4 engine which pubg uses. He said 'we're starting to have concerns that they're going to develop new features or improve something in the engine to support that battle royale gameplay, and then use it for their own game mode.'Just dude your game is breaking every goddamn sale records, you can hire ton of devs to enhance your game, optimize it, fix it but no you don't you just add crates, create new problems like the binding problem in the last update (i already see fanboys telling me 'but hey you just have to go in the folder and make the .ini read only' but what about just fixing this sh*t ?). The game is barely playable and you force people to upgrade our graphical settings many times because muh it has to be fair, atleast optimize it first before giving us 50fps which become unfair for mid specs pc, nuggethead.This game updates are so slow and the game is supposed to be out of EA during this fall, at this pace the game won't be optimized enough & will just be barely playable like it is right now. They basically add a gun per month & a weather with some bonus bugs and a feature every 3 months.

Dimsun	Not Recommended	90.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971461804/	I've had a lot of good times playing this game. Multiple of my friends own this game, and when we got together to play as a squad it was absolutely amazing. In a sense I bet it still would be, the gameplay has not really changed. But it does say something when the choices by a developer manage to ruin a game to such an extent that a fundamentally pleasant gameplay experience can be soured. I've seen complaints about lootboxes. I've seen pro- and con arguments. A lot of people talk about supporting the developer. But to me the idea that they would introduce both lootboxes behind a paywall in conjunction with a pass they've obvioulsy ripped off Fortnite seems downright greedy. Not only has the game not been optimised sufficiently since early Alpha, they have the guts to ask for more money from people who have ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME. This is no longer 'supporting your developer'. In the recent sale PUBG was again a top seller. At this point it has become a cash grab. The fact that we've had fun, and can still have fun, seems like an accident at this point. The only reason to play now is the naive assumption that we are all weathering a bug ridden mess untill "they finally fix the early access game it is". Except that it isn't early access. It is a full release. More time goes into the main menu now than the engine. The engine is probably so broken by this point that they can't even fix it without a major overhaul. And that will simply never happen.

Arteken	Recommended	117.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/arteken1/	PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSMy review for this game in early access. So this is a battleroyale game. A match consists a game that has 100 plaers in it. You spawn in a plane with other people and then you have to jump to the playable area. Then it is time to get some loot, find guns etc. to help you survive. You then have to kill other players of course and try to survive a red area, that has explosions in it. It is random where it spawns. You have to slowly go to the marked area where all players that are still alive will go and that area is slowly going smaller. Also there is drops in the game from a plane. Thats the idea of this game.  For me its really fun with friends mostly. You can play this as solo, duo or with 2 or 3 friends. It takes some time for you to get in to this game if you have never played a game similar to this, but it did not took me that long. Shooting works well and you need some skill with it.  Sounds are really good and realistick.  Physics could be better, but I assume they will make everything better as time goes by. Gameplay in nutshel is really good at this point, will be better of course. There is bugs, it is only early access, but bugs I have met are small nothing to ruin the game experience that bad. Some bugs are pretty bad, but some actually funny. The game is also cheap for a game like this. In game items are also nice and the thing that you can open them by just playing the game is really amazing.For me this game runs really well on mid-tier settings, you really do not need those high graphics at my opinion. I get usually around 100fps on my mid-tier settings. I have i5 and 1050ti strix gaming inside my computer.Thank you for reading my review and have a good day! :)So my grade for this game as it is now 9,5/10!
Dankk	Not Recommended	234.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/derpsalad/	This is probably one of the most fun games I have ever played. I love the pace, I love the mechanics and I love the realism. All of these aspects come together to make an immersive, tense game. I am just a casual player who enjoys the game with my friends and the occasional solo game.You're probably wondering: why am I not reccomending this game? Well, the simple fact is that this game is far from finished, and riddled with game-breaking bugs, as well as some other flaws, which include, but are not limited to:- Textures failing to load in- The way the game handles cheaters (banning their account meaning they can pay for another account and carry on)- The main menu UI being horrendous, most of the time requiring a restart or two of the entire game in order to fix.- Instead of fixing the basic issues such as the potato servers and performance, they are following the money and are almost exclusively working on ways to make more money (teaming up with Micro$oft in order to port the game for xbox). Seriously Bluehole?Most importantly, and I would argue that this is the "make or break":- The game relies on practice. Now this isn't necessarily a bad point, however there is a very steep and unforgiving learning curve for new players that have never played a game of the same type. You have to resort to guides outside of the game to learn some stratergies and skills (which again, isn't nescessarily a bad thing).Overall, although this game has been very fun for my playtime overall, I unfortunately wouldn't be able to reccomend the game. Some of my friends who are new to shooters and especially battle royale games said this has been one of the most entertaining games they have ever played, yet these small issues can really ruin the immersion and the aspect of fun in the game.TL;DR:Although IT IS FUN, I won't reccomend this game until Bluehole fixes the issues pertaining to the game. PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK.Edit: Grammar

When compared to Battlefield 1(far from a perfect game) PUBG falls flat in graphics, gunplay, map design, ect.  While I am glad it is somone new, rather than EA or Ubisfot getting rich(better to have 100 rich ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s than 5). This game is almost like a ponzi scheme that is going to crash soon(the stupid lawssuit agianst the makers of Fortnight is a great sign of desperation for more money)In my opinion PUBG is a 6/10 game that has no place being one of the most played in the world

By having not resolved it for its final and rather overdue release, it's shown to all new players as well as old just how little they were able to move past the limitations of independent development, despite the success of the game.

Specter	Not Recommended	249.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032623800/	I'm the kind of person that doesn't ever bother to review steam games but I feel like this game has earned it. Great game but it's almost unplayable because of hackers. 1 in 4 matches in death to hacker, speedhacks, aim hacks, ranged punches through walls. If they do not reduce the problem with hackers this game will not, and should not, survive. Moreover I've found some stuff in other reviews that deserves to be seen by more people- "While immensely flawed from the begining, PUBG brought a new and intense gaming experience like nothing we had ever really seen before.In spite of the bugs and shoddy servers, my friend and I put hundreds of hours into the game mostly playing Duo's, and now we consistently rank in the Top 50 players on the leaderboards.Sadly in the last few weeks the game has become infested with hackers and Bluehole has expressed no interest whatsoever in taking serious steps to remediate the problem. Based upon the limited available evidence, it appears a Chinese company Tencent has bought a 5% stake in the game to allow it to be sold in China, and are creating and selling the hacks on the backend. So basically the developer is in cahoots with the hack devs. Tencent's stake purchases also coincides perfectly with the meteoric explosion in concurrent players on steam stats.While it seemed for sometime the devs actually cared about bringing the game to completion, it appears this game will go the way of its predecessors Dayz, Warz, and H1Z1 into irrelevancy."AND-"I honestly find it hard to believe they're doing anything to ban the cheaters unless their software recognizes the cheatters. I sent them video proof of cheaters (they were running speed hacks which is beyond obvious and getting auto headshots every hit. can't prove the aimbots but can 100% confirm the speed hacks). been over a week later, they're still playing with their 90.0 k/d ratio."Did you just read what I read? a 90.0 k/d ratio, A 90 K/D RATIO! THAT IS LITERALLY IMPOSSIBLE WITHOUT HACKS! How hard is it to look at the killboards and manually ban people with this stupidly impossible kill ratio!?!?!?In conclusion, stakeholders are in cahoots with the people that make the hacks and are raking it in on both sides, both when they sell the hacks and when people have to re-buy after being banned (in addition to purchases from, ya know, normal players). if they cannot effectively deal with hackers this amazing game should die. If you play PUBG and are outraged by this then write a review and hit them in the wallet.
Ryuu ga waga teki wo kurau	Not Recommended	90.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165075774/	Awesome game, so much fun, especially with friends... but it so damn bug and bad optimized that is so painful to play, 50% of time it crashes or the textures doesnt render, i would to play this game when they make it right.
2-D	Not Recommended	249.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LepyStudios/	I used to really enjoy this game, but when you notice the issues, they become all you can really focus on, to the point where you realize just how terrible the game really is.Firstoff, the game is buggy as all hell. Literally anyone that's played this game for more than 5 hours will have run into at least 1 problem. And that's being generous. The facts that they have a refresh UI button and the rejoin game option being so celebrated show how much they actually care about fixing their hot mess of a game.Next is the overall terrible gun mechanics. Please explain to me how it makes sense for an entire magazine from a UMP being loaded into your body won't kill you, but a pump shotgun can one shot body shot you from thirty feet away.The game itself is incredibly boring, as most of the time you are either looking for items or trying to get into the zone. The overall lack of firefighting in the typical game of Battlegrounds is almost embarrasing, not to mention the fact that the supposed new map is going to be a dessert. Which means a solid third of the map won't be covered in water, so it will only be worse. And you could argue that you've had super action packed games of PUBG, and you got like 20 kills! But then you have to remember how often something like that actually happens.Which leads into the point that wins overall are not satisfactory. Going through a painstakingly slow game just to see a screen that says "chicken dinner" and getting a few extra coins to buy boring looking cosmetics does not sound like fun to me. "B-B-B-BUT THERE'S SO MUCH TENSION IN GAMES LEADING UP TO THE FINAL MOMENTS!" Maybe for the first few games. But after playing it for a bit you start to see just how repetitive it all is, to the point where there's no real tension.The final and probably most infuriating part of this game comes from the developers themselves. They've shown that they're too lazy to try to fix the performance that they have MORE than enough money for, they constantly ban people for stream sniping, even when 9/10 times it was just a coincedence that they killed a streamer, bringing in micro transactions to AN EARLY ACCESS GAME after explicitly stating that they wouldn't, and probably worst of all they act like toddlers when presented with other battle-royale games, when the game itself started out as a mod for another game and after the battle-royale genre had already been around for years.Overall I do NOT reccomend this game to anyone. It's buggy, has poor performance, is boring, and the developers are major ♥♥♥♥♥.
Arteken	Recommended	117.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/arteken1/	PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDSMy review for this game in early access. So this is a battleroyale game. A match consists a game that has 100 plaers in it. You spawn in a plane with other people and then you have to jump to the playable area. Then it is time to get some loot, find guns etc. to help you survive. You then have to kill other players of course and try to survive a red area, that has explosions in it. It is random where it spawns. You have to slowly go to the marked area where all players that are still alive will go and that area is slowly going smaller. Also there is drops in the game from a plane. Thats the idea of this game.  For me its really fun with friends mostly. You can play this as solo, duo or with 2 or 3 friends. It takes some time for you to get in to this game if you have never played a game similar to this, but it did not took me that long. Shooting works well and you need some skill with it.  Sounds are really good and realistick.  Physics could be better, but I assume they will make everything better as time goes by. Gameplay in nutshel is really good at this point, will be better of course. There is bugs, it is only early access, but bugs I have met are small nothing to ruin the game experience that bad. Some bugs are pretty bad, but some actually funny. The game is also cheap for a game like this. In game items are also nice and the thing that you can open them by just playing the game is really amazing.For me this game runs really well on mid-tier settings, you really do not need those high graphics at my opinion. I get usually around 100fps on my mid-tier settings. I have i5 and 1050ti strix gaming inside my computer.Thank you for reading my review and have a good day! :)So my grade for this game as it is now 9,5/10!

NeoFenyx	Not Recommended	237.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136856477/	*Update: RIP PUBG... COD:BO4 side BR mode kills this game in all aspects. Spend your money there.After 236.9 hours...I've played PUBG with an overclocked Intel i7 and an overclocked GTX 1080 with all the fixings that plays all my other games (Battefield 4 & 1 and recently BF V Open Beta, Fortnite, Overwatch, Paladins, etc.) on thier highest setting on a 3k widescreen monitor at 3k settings at its native 100 hz no sweat and no lag,  yet this game lags on my system and I have everything on its lowest settings. The concept is great, graphics look good, yet the execution is atrocious when it comes to the lag in this game (this is only one aspect, but the most annoying). I have waited a long time for a fix and I give up. FIX PUBG is a false promise to entice the wallets of new player that should instead wait for the new generation of Battle Royale games to buy those instead of this game. This game should still be in early access for it is  far from completion. Selling keys for real world money to open loot box/suitcases for aesthetic/ cosmetic items when your game runs like molasses on a top notch gaming computer is a fail to your fanbase, and evidence of your priorities being in reaping money and not a satified gamer. I played this is game because of the player's and what looked like a great early access game, but now am patiently waiting for DICE (Battefield Series) or COD to release their BR games which look amazing and I know will run properly. It would take ton of great reviews for me to ever purchase a game from Bluehole again. I hope this helps someone to wait to buy a better game in the BR genre that has a military sim feel unlike Fortnite.

Miliverse	Not Recommended	36.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Miliverse/	I thought this would be the game that breaks the mould. The Early Access game that doesn't try and grub more money after you've already invested a decent amount into it. I was wrong apparently, as PlayerUnknown and Bluehole have shown utter disdain for their audience and playerbase by adding an identical system to the CS:GO cash grab system known as Case Openings.
MoonSha	Not Recommended	673.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MoonSha/	The 1.0 version of PUBG still an absolutely pathetic showing from the previously "booby mmo" cloning/stealing Korean dev team (they lost the lawsuit). Crashing minimum every 3 games is now the norm, a MASSIVE decrease in stability from previous so called "beta/pre-release" versions. What kind of studio releases a game that's less stable than the alpha and calls it job done?Blueballs Interior Design has no idea how to make a real game, the studio is a joke and brings nothing but shame to their names, I'll explain even further why below.Chinese Cheaters run rife in this sloppily coded mod they pretend is a standalone game, and they always will. The state of the game is all the indication that anybody needs that the Dev Team are monkeys pulling levers and pressing buttons. They have no idea what they are doing, where they are going and the monkey is charge is always doing a 'con or interview. As such the game is a hodgepodge of sloppy fixes and rushed additions, leaving a million holes for cheaters to exploit. As time goes by the cheaters won't reduce, they will only get better. More powerful exploits will be found in the swiss cheese code, maybe the most exciting thing about the game is seeing what the (actually talented, unlike the devs) cheat creators come up with in the future.Every game session is marred by multiple bugs, horrendous rubber banding for the first few minutes, glitchy physics on players and vehicles, non-existent footsteps and ghost footsteps are now commonplace. Bullets pass right through enemies at range, or get stopped by invisible rocks and other objects since objects are now culled in the name of FPS but at the expense of gameplay. Smokes are often invisible to one or more members of my squad. I'll throw three and see only two, how often enemies mustn't see them. Practically every aspect of the game is buggy, the vehicles cannot go up steep hills because the AI constantly shifts gears, killing all speed. The VW Combi clone will stop dead on the unsmoothed, computer generated terrain that has bumps and jutting angles left over from world generation. The system demands you rejoin solo games you've already died in EVERY TIME you load the lobby, but will often refuse to allow you to rejoin squad and duo games in progress after your nth "app module" crash of the day. In the name of FPS enemy players are now culled the INSTANT they leave your sight, which when combined with the 10-15 tickrate of the game results in constantly teleporting enemies. Enemy ran behind a tree briefly? expect a 5m teleport when they exit the other side as your client tries to play catchup.A very simple to use exploit that will likely never be fixed is to have one dead squad member, split one live member 1km+ away from the remaining two, the spectator can now switch between remaining members and will see no buildings after each switch for as long as their computer permits, until assets load. Players of course are perfectly visible inside the invisible buildings. The UI, recently upgraded for release is prettier and more useless in every way, friendly markers are larger than 20 bedroom buildings on the tiny, unzoomable minimap. There is now two blue markers in every squad, clearly no consideration goes into decisions like this.I expect we'll soon see Brendan "Tom" Greene leaving the now monolithic "PUBG CORP" in order to chase his dream of finally creating a decent Battle Royale game, whenever that time comes, PUBG will still be unfinished, buggy, exploitable and filled with cheaters.

Fr0stypaw	Not Recommended	1,084.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0stypaw/	Overall rating of 1.0: 2/10. Huge disappointment.> De-sync is still a major issue. Being shot while (presumably) behind cover is frustrating.> Loot is scarce on the new map - all concentrated in cities where building layouts are poor - corridors are tight with many doors leading to empty rooms. Compound looting that was viable in Erangel is no longer viable in Miramar, and players are forced to drop into main cities and contest each other for loot. This limits viable drop points and creates monotonous gameplay. > Peripheral blur on 4x/8x is a complete handicap and unncessary. > Crouch-jumping should still be in the game for more experienced players; let noobs rely on vaulting techniques. Vaulting has created a clunkiness to the player experience and inhibits the dynamacy of combat. > As of this review, map variation is NOT split 50/50. It is more like 80% Miramar, 20% Erangel. That's being generous. I played 15 matches this evening and 13 of them were Miramar.

Fr0stypaw	Not Recommended	1,084.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fr0stypaw/	Overall rating of 1.0: 2/10. Huge disappointment.> De-sync is still a major issue. Being shot while (presumably) behind cover is frustrating.> Loot is scarce on the new map - all concentrated in cities where building layouts are poor - corridors are tight with many doors leading to empty rooms. Compound looting that was viable in Erangel is no longer viable in Miramar, and players are forced to drop into main cities and contest each other for loot. This limits viable drop points and creates monotonous gameplay. > Peripheral blur on 4x/8x is a complete handicap and unncessary. > Crouch-jumping should still be in the game for more experienced players; let noobs rely on vaulting techniques. Vaulting has created a clunkiness to the player experience and inhibits the dynamacy of combat. > As of this review, map variation is NOT split 50/50. It is more like 80% Miramar, 20% Erangel. That's being generous. I played 15 matches this evening and 13 of them were Miramar. Let players choose the map that they prefer, or opt for both.> For gods sake remove cosmetic items from your loot tables. I don't want to pick up a shirt or a beanie.

Kronikor	Recommended	484.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994503736/	I just uninstalled this game. Now hold the potatoes two seconds, woman - I'm gonna break it down why I uninstalled, while making sure you know this game is a seriously fun, addicting, but ultimately unplayable game. So here we go:Let's do what's known as a compliment sandwhich. When you're in the top 10 and the ring is closing, you have people on all sides - there are few games that stack up in terms of sheer excitement and intensity. Those final moments in every engagement are simply exhilirating. Bravo. Unfortunately because this game is still an early access game, it has problems. And these problems often result in you dying, through no fault of your own. And in a game where the only payoff for your efforts is clutching the win, 20 minutes of playing only to get dicked by a broken game, again, and again, and again - really starts to wear on the soul.  Oop, I'm stuck in the wall, game over, even though I'm fully looted with 8 kills and in perfect position to win. Great. Oop, I died from falling damage? I was walking down the ♥♥♥♥ing stairs! WTF?!  Things like shaders, and bullet trajectories are all client side. This means you can edit player textures to be shaded neon pink if you want, and grass to be literally nonexistent. It's for these reasons that I uninstalled this fun♥♥♥♥♥game. Now the last piece of bread - I will definitely come back to this game, when it has matured a little. It needs to get out of its teenage rebellious years and enter into functioning adult-hood. In the game's current state, I can't recommend it - but I can recommend the game as what it will be very soon. The dev team is simply wonderful. They're active in the community, actually listen to what they want, and almost always deliver a high quality monthly patch. I'm confident the amazing dev team will get this game to where it needs to be, and in it's current state it's a fun, addicting, exhilirating game - however it's plagued by broken-ness and rage inducing flaws that simply make it a waste of time right now. Recommendation: Definite YES, just not now.EDIT: I have reinstalled the game, and have played 50 or so rounds with the latest patch. Quite a few quality of life features added, broken-ness and server issues addressed, new guns, new weather features. Game is playable and I alter my review score to: Definite Yes, NOW.EDIT2: Hold on again, the devs are screwing up now - paid for loot crates, the only way to get them. Banning people for "stream sniping" - which there's no way to prove or detect. Broken after this most recent patch again. Mods are weilding their power like children and abusing it to the extremes, to the detriment of the community. UPDATED RECOMMENDATION: You'll have fun, but the development has done a complete 180 and is going the wrong way now. We'll see if it changes with the next monthly patch, but the future is not looking as bright as it once was for this game.

Alone	Recommended	359.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/_Clu_/	The most balanced and well made Battle Royale game out there. No Surprise coming from PU the god of BR ;)From the movement to the gunplay to the UI it's all very well done and simple to use.Coming from a competetive and survival player's viewmpoint playing games like cs:go at the top rank and other games like arma 2, arma 3, dayz, H1Z1, etc. This is the most polished and well thought out game i've played in a long time and it's rapidly turned into one of if not my favorite game of all time. I played the alpha and didn't like it much. The transformation it went through simply from the alpha to the beta made tremendous leaps forward and already got so much better. I fully place my faith in PU and the team behind this game. They've already showcased their ability to fix different bugs and problems that have rapidly appeared before them and I have nothing but high hopes for the future. If you love the Battle Royale genre, support the best experience you can have and buy the game. You won't regret it.

Regarding the game itself, it's pretty okay as long as the servers aren't acting up. It's pretty badly optimized (70fps@1440p on a 7700K/1080 rig, no matter the graphics settings) though.  This has been much improved on 1.0 release; servers still have 2Hz tickrate though!sources: re:Player bans https://www.reddit.com/r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/comments/6q0otl/duo_partner_banned_for_7_days_for_stream_sniping/re:Microtransactions and promise of not to add them"We're not doing monetization during early access, it'll be afterwards."http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/297434/quotSkin_economy_is_a_good_thingquot_says_Playerunknowns_Battlegrounds_creator.php"As far as monetization is concerned, know that we eventually intend to give the player options to purchase cosmetic items only.

thepreeus	Not Recommended	544.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thepreeus/	Do not buy this game.Devs prioritise adding microtransactions over releasing a fully playable game (those with the game will remember that patch) and the game sufffers from being poorly optimised.My worst problem though with this game is that the devs prioritise streamers over average players.Streamers who make money off the game just complain about people harassing them and they can get other players who paid for the game banned. Average players end up banned when they might have made no error (GO READ OTHER REVIEWS). There is no dedicated competetive mode where players such as streamers can play seriously if they want and people can suffer from cooldowns for not taking it seriously (playing the game for fun). However knowing that there is a single gamemode, you might argue that you should be prepared to play with people who will destroy you (such as streamers/pros) or people who dont play the game seriously at all (such as people who enjoy honking horns).I agree with this logic, and i would suggest, that if streamers play a game with a single mode where they can get people honking at them, they should be prepared for it. This is a problem because THE DEVS ARE LITERALLY ROBBING PEOPLE BY BANNING THEM AND RENDERING THEM UNABLE TO PLAY A GAME THAT THEY PAID FOR BECAUSE THEY PLAY IT FOR FUN. YOU DONT BUY FOOD TO BE TOLD YOU CANT EAT IT BECAUSE THE WAY YOU EAT IT IRRITATES OTHER PEOPLE AT THE DINNER TABLE.I can understand banning players for cheating, but banning players for "harassment" is a fine line that is made worse by the fact that serious players cant be separated from casuals. Determining what consitutes unacceptable conduct is difficult in nature when the person who determines it doesn't give all parties the opportunity to tell them their understanding of events. But streamers provide Bluehole with free advertising, and the money they make off advertising as well as forcing consumers to repurchase their products is too much to argue with, and the average player suffers because the devs do not care about your opinion.

That is not ok.Almost 700 hours in the game and i play it almost everyday but still a can't recommend it. if we keep giving them money they will not listen to us and they will just keep as much as possible for themself so please don't buy the game until they listen to the hand that feed them.Greedy bastards.

Even with all the performance patches I don't really see or feel a difference-They're putting the focus too hard on twitch, making people advertise the game more means more income instead of selling the game because of it's great hardware and development support.-CheatersVerdict:We have until september before it is exiting alpha stage and in the three months that I own this game I have seen many patch notes, many praises towards the development team. But all I can truely see is a Cash milking cow focusing too hard on Twitch and exclusive items. Also exclusive twitch game modes which makes famous streamers king and us just peasants. They have earned a lot of money and respect from the playerbase and have expanded the team (which is a good thing). They released a video at E3 with a vaulting feature and the zombie game mode.I'm willing to adjust my review when it's coming out as a full game but for people doubting to buy this game now I would say: No, just wait.EDIT: I'm a bit more positive towards the developers tough, they have expanded their team x2 and you could really see the difference within the first week. Performance-wise it is also much better. I hope they can keep it upEDIT 2: Here we are again, back @ ground zero. I'm happy that the crates have returned me 3x the money that I've put in this game. For more then over a year they've been ignoring players. I don't suggest buying the season pass because you'll end up loading their wheelbarrows full of cash. But maybe, MAYBE, someday we will all get a polished version of the game but in the meantime other developers are rising and will surely deliver us a proper Battle Royale game before they'll fix everything. Bluecorp my suggestion: Instead of sueing why don't you load up your own gun before we can kiss the dog goodbye?

bvauwnies	Not Recommended	154.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/69br0wnies96/	Hottest game of 2017And this broken and laggy cluster♥♥♥♥ is all it has to offer.This is a prime example of what happens when AAA titles start following mobile trends and turn their games into overpriced dlc and microstransaction simulators. People lower their standards to a degree that this game becomes acceptable, which is just wrong.(click this link, I have reached the maximum letters)[i.imgur.com]This is where I start talking about the game in-depth, if you want a quick summary, it's at the end.// The Community //It is very clear that the individuals playing this game aren't very smart and they can only look at what's in front of them.Most of the people here are very obsessed with this game, defending it like it's their own child.S̶o̶r̶r̶y̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶b̶r̶e̶a̶k̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶ ̶f̶a̶n̶b̶o̶y̶s̶,̶ ̶b̶u̶t̶ ̶a̶ ̶g̶a̶m̶e̶ ̶i̶s̶n̶'̶t̶ ̶i̶m̶m̶u̶n̶e̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶c̶r̶i̶t̶i̶c̶i̶s̶m̶ ̶j̶u̶s̶t̶ ̶b̶e̶c̶a̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶i̶t̶'̶s̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶"̶E̶a̶r̶l̶y̶ ̶A̶c̶c̶e̶s̶s̶"̶.̶Now for every bug and glitch you'll encounter, your EA excuse won't help anymore.Not to mention this game isn't worth the praise it's getting by these brainless idiots.The game didn't improve much since first Alpha test and Full Release. (the vehicles and sound are the only exception)And i'm sure even here they'll comment about how i have X hrs in the last two weeks and how am I not satisfied if I played for X hrs on record.// The Concept and Gameplay //The core gameplay is good and it's very addicting. I enjoy my time playing this game with friends when everything is going in my way, but then RNG kicks in to ruin all your fun.It is very clear that the devs didn't know how to execute this idea properly.For a game that requires a lot of skill, it's heavily based on RNG.Everything from RNG loot (Sometimes you walk into a house and leave fully geared, other times you come out with nothing and sometimes you only find ammo without guns, what's up with that?) to the Blue Circles (Instead of making everyone go to a zone where nobody is in, one lucky ♥♥♥♥er gets to camp and shoot the others running to the zone), and even then, that's not the worst idea they implemented.Meet the Reward System!Oh wait, did I say reward? That's for people who reach Chicken Dinners every god damn game, because if you don't make it to least TOP10 (SOLO), TOP5 (DUO), TOP3 (SQUADS) you basically wasted your time gathering loot for other people. The problem is that you don't feel awarded at all, sure you get your BP that's worth nothing, but what now? You're going to buy your useless crate and get another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shirt? Yeah, I'll pass on that.// The Optimisation //Before we start, if you played this game already, I'd like to ask you to go and see the "Minimum Requirements" for yourself. Comment down below if you truly believe that that is the case and the game would run even on 40 fps.Even tho this game looks like it's from 2014, modern GPUs and CPUs still struggle to run it. What's up with that?I can swear I spent the first 20 hours of the game just trying to tweak this game and settled for 1024x768 4:3, Lowest Settings and 4 Launch Options, just so that I could get a steady ~50-60 fps without dipping into low 40s, 30s.EDIT: Adding this here as suggested by iPlayer.The game uses the CPU heavily which is a bad choice since GPUs are way superior and more advanced at the moment.
dreamsic	Not Recommended	910.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047469623/	Decent game, good core mechanics, but too many problems that dev team has ignored/been to slow to fix to recommend. I would advise waiting for one of the AAA studios to release a polished battle royale instead of playing this. The issues as follows in order of most critical to least: edit late 2017: to top off the list below, cheating has become rife for months. Extremely cheap aimbotter available, and accounts can be purchased far below RRP for the banned account. Devs seem oblivious. Every game has a speed hacker or aimbotter without exception.1. CSHR implementation/lag compensationIn the current iteration, players with bad ping to the server have a huge advantage. Fine for a casual shooter but not for a hardcore battle royale. The implementation of this in PUBG is extremely poor and very well documented to be a huge issue. There are no ping caps for region selection which means someone like me in australia can go and play on asia / na / europe with almost a half second of advantage over people there, and vice versa. Half a second's advantage, needless to say, is an insanely long time considering the time to kill on guns in pubg is in milliseconds. Absolutely inexcusable for a competitive shooter.Short term solution: lock the regionsLong term solution: probably isn't one, at best I predict they will adjust how the CSHR works but why would they embark on such a challenge? look at the sales numbers, and it's possible PUBG won't stick around and develop a long lasting competitive scene and remain mostly a casual shooter, masquerading as something more.2. Desync / general combat issuesTeleporting players, bullets disappearing, getting shot behind walls etcetera. Early game is unplayable, mid game a bit better. For a shooter game, the hitreg and bullet reliability is bafflingly poor. Could be engine related, could be server related. Devs are completely silent on this issue which likely means game will be as is on launch. Countless game breaking combat bugs such as bullets ignoring armour, perfectly aimed shotgun blasts going through players, imagine the most frustrating combat outcomes and this game will deliver it to you in short time.3. FPP / TPP game mode rolloutVery poorly handled by the devs. Hardcore players want FPP, casuals want TPP. FPP switch still hasn't been turned on for all regions which means that by the dev's own admission, huge percentages of players are playing on other servers so they can play FPP (hello problem number 1 I mentioned earlier which they don't seem to care about).4. Vehicle mechanics and player mechanicsPlay meticulously for 20 minutes, but then you hit a tiny speck of dust on a road and suddenly your vehicle explodes, killing you, or corkscrews 360 degrees into oblivion, also killing you, and leaving you more frustrated than an aging hooker.The character you control is almost as bad as the vehicles. Slow to move, turn, runs 100m in 20 seconds, which is very slow for a video game featuring a lot of simulated running. This bumbling, unathletic that idiot you control can get stuck inside fences, rocks, doors, you name it, your unfortunate little guy can glitch through anything if you're not careful.5. Loot randomness improved, but still garbageLand somewhere hot because you want action not 35 minutes of looting/stalking. Oh, this house doesn't have a gun. Nor does this one. Or this one. The guy who has been chasing you has two assault rifles and a helmet and sends you back to the main menu.Next game you decide to spend an hour parachuting somewhere away from the chances of this happening again (remember it takes about 3 minutes for queue > lobby > land somewhere, so these sorts of frustrating deaths don't come at zero cost). You loot about 30 houses and find 32 uzis, 12 shotguns, 35 first aids, and 20 energy drinks.Of course the opposite can happen and you find guns, ammo, optics and meds in a timely fashion so you aren't showing up to a gun fight with a knife. But the parameters for randomness are far too wide, which means that skill can't factor into a large percentage of games which can leave you very frustrated.6. Graphics/Sound issuesFor a game mostly about trying to spot enemies before they spot you, bafflingly we have a blurry hud, headache inducing lensflare and bloom effects, oh and they just added a nauseating screen shake to FPP and impact on jumping. There are competing elements in the dev team it seems, one wants an amazing competitive battle royale shooting game, the other wants a cinematic experience. Annoying ambient noises you can't switch off (like there's a freeway in the distance, or some sort of faint industrial fan noise). Vehicles make your ears bleed. Rain will turn you insane. There's even a spooky soundtrack for the fog! Aboslutely ridiculous.7. Community team, website, and general issuesHow could we leave the community team out of this. I'm sure there are a less competent team of individuals out there with worse public relations skills, but i'm yet to discover them. Dreadful bans by the admins. Fascist running of their forums by stereotypically power hungry cave dwellers deleting posts with any sign of dissent and even constructive criticism. And due to the negative community response to all of the above, the dev team (arguably the only people worth hearing from) are now simply avoiding public relations, instead of manning up and learning from their mistakes and engaging positively to help change the direction. Of course this comes from the top, with the game creator citing ptsd on twitter and saying words are important, while the lobbies in his game are filled with the foulest racism and most abject voice communication content i have heard, and trust me when i say that i have heard some.8. Game interface and quality of life issuesThey use a .htm as their game menu. Thankfully it isn't as buggy as before. But games from the 90s had quicker smoother interfaces, and they probably had a team of 1 guy designing it. 9. Team/regional issuesFrom NA but don't have friends online? Queue up to get matched with Asian players who don't speak english and leave their mic on while your ears bleed to the sounds of their internet cafe. Want to mute them? Guess what, you can't hear your entire team now. From OC? Same issue. EU? anyone's guess. You get the picture - unless you have teammates online, you're gonna have a bad time in squads. For me this isn't an issue because my friends are all obsessed with this game, but I tested this and found 7 out of 10 games on non Asian servers, my teammates were Asian players who had picked the laggier server presumably for a ping advantage, (refer problem one) and proceeded to pollute voice comms the entire game. Inescapably cancerous behaviour enabled by lack of options and poor game design.10. General optimisationSlowly, slowly, the game crawls towards a reasonable framerate. Running 6700k/1070 I still get dips to 30fps. I shudder to think of people loading this game up with only the recommended specs and not high end consumer gear. Definitely stay away from this game if you don't have an SSD and 16gb or more of ram, and a mid/high end cpu/gpu combo.

However the amount of downs heavily outweigh the positives with an extreme dissapointment from the devs efforts.This game did alright in EA but the main reason a lot of people disliked the game was bescause it was filled with bugs. I expected more from 1.0 than just a new HUD, a new desert map which is extremely buggy and seems unfinished, a death cam so you can watch your bs death again, not many bug fixes and vaulting which is the only neccassary thing that should've been done. The devs are lazy and don't deal with the hackers, the huge amount of Asians playing on Australian servers when they have their own, just make people play in their region! With the amount of copies they have sold they have done an extremely lazy job on the game, with the amount of money they have they can do more. The hitboxes are still horrible and you aim at them and somehow you miss when clearly it should've hit them. The motorbikes still have not been fixed nor have shotguns. Sometimes the game doesnt register the damage properly where I have been 1 shot by a kar98k with a lvl 3 helmet on with full HP. This game can be fun when you don't get bs all the time which happens a lot in this game, espicially with your friends.In conclusion this game has been done poorly, with the amount of money made the devs should be able to do so much more. The game is still too buggy and filled with lots of things that need to be fixed.

Malachi [NGC|ST]	Recommended	739.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995129935/	The Good:Quick connection to servers.Intense multiplayer action ramping up to a finale.Great playing with friends.The Bad:Rampant reports of bad behavior by devs (unwarranted bans, breaking microtransactions promise).Only one map?Unable to spectate match after death.Low FPS.No scoreboard.High purchase price for a 'beta' ($30 as of today).No deathcam.In-game voice uses 'localized sound' to talk to players in your vicinity.3rd person view encourages abuse (use 1st person view-restricted servers to get around this).Statistics wrong (incorrect # of games, # of wins).Some of these would be easy to fix. Team Fortress 2 (among others) supported community map developement, eventually adding some to the game. Spectate could use a delay, so that you could watch the rest of the match after it was over. Server-recorded demos (like CS:GO uses) could be downloaded shortly after the match completed - allowing players to watch game unfold. Add a scoreboard (that's only viewable after game completion - if that's even a concern). And of course, lower the price to $20.Cheers!*After playing for a couple of weeks, I have a few additional comments.There is no real integration with Steam. This means that in-game your friends don't use their Steam name. Outside of the game, you can't invite friends into a lobby or view their score/status. Instead you're forced to go through the limited in-game UI (which constantly needs refreshing). The in-game list of Steam friends also shows everyone as 'offline' - unless they happen to also to have the game open and sitting in lobby. Only then can you invite.In game, there is just about no way to communicate with others. There is no text chat. There is no scoreboard with which to report/friend/view profiles.  In fact you can't even see who you were playing against (not even using the Previous Players function). The voice comms are crappy (but not unusuable). They also turn off just before the scoreboard shows. We had a great random join our squad, but couldn't friend him - frustrating!With all that said, some will point to how this game is still in 'early release'. If this were a small-budget game I would totally understand. Currently, this game has pulled in over $300 Mil. in sales. Also, they reportedly have expanded from 35 employees to over 70. This frustrates me to no end.The one saving grace - and it's a big one - is that gameplay is solid. I haven't crashed, I've only glitched 3 times (and was able to quickly get out of 2 of those), and things generally work like they're supposed to.
-Anything.	Not Recommended	436.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198105100491/	I don't usualy give out negative reviews, but I have to give PUBG a negative one. Ever since I played this game, I have kept my epectatin on the devs. At first, I was so glad that there was a dev team that concerns about the game instead of just earning tons of money and stoppping providing support for the game. For the first several months, the devs were constantly updating the game. I even recommended a lot of my friends to play this game. I could see the improvement along the way --fixing server lag and making the game playable by optimizing the graphics. However, Blue Hole you let me down. After half a year, you still have not totally fixed the fps drop issue. I have a GTX 1080, and i7-4790k with 16 GB RAM, but I still suffer from the low fps. I could run Battlefield 1 on the ultra settings with over 80 fps on a 1440p screen, but this game runs around 70-80fps in mid setting. If I am in a red zone, the fps would be around 60 or even worse under some enviroment. The server lag becomes a huge issue now. It had been smooth for a period of time, but then it just went back or even worse. I can accept the lag when you just released the game, but after half a year, you just made it worse. I cannot tolerate that kind of result. I do love this game, but plz dev dont ruin this game plz. You should deal with all the hacks happening in the game. I met some hackers in the game and reported them, but they did not receive any punishment and still bullying other players in the game. And stop kissing those streamers' A$$. Instead, you should care more about the massive player community. Yes, indeed, streamers help promote this game, but they are small percentage of the community. You should care about the real matter here --the players! I am so disappointed by this game, but I hope you guys can improve in the future. Before that, I have to leave a negative review for you. I am sorry, but I have to do it.>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Update:Devs you should f yourself. I was outside of the zone and there was a buggy. I took the buggy and the buggy could only speed up to 20km/h. Yep, thanks dev for this game. GG dev. Keep kissing streamer's asses. Go F yourselves.

NANGus	Not Recommended	288.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198134225139/	This game can be great fun. Unfortunately, 90% of the time its utter garbage. If you arent dying to someone with better ping than you or hacks you are running from the zone or enjoying the vehicles that are either abundant or non existent. Did I mention the simple act of going from flat grassland to an actual road can flip your car, if not utterly destroy it?Dont even bother with the hilly parts of the map, as you cant aim up while proned on a hill. Fog maps look like cancer, rain maps kill fps and the game is so horribly optimised that sometimes buildings will fail to load at all. If this happens to you, have fun seeing, and shooting through walls, as well as driving through them. If I didnt properly emphasise it, there is almost always a hacker on every server.  Sometimes there are hackers fighting each other for the main spot while you cower in a corner and hope to god that they somehow die before finding you. Aim hacks are bad enough, but speed hacks are plain insanity, impossible to hit and faster than your car. Then there is walls, lower tier aim hacks as well as loot hacks etc that make this game seriously frustrating.To address the better ping thing, Im not talking about just missing constantly and blaming lag. Im talking about shooting and getting blood splats, but not registering hits. Its happened to me both ways, shooting someone 3-4 times while they are running only for them to one shot you with a shotgun, and for none of that damage to register. Inversely, getting blood splats all over you but one tapping someone with a shotgun or headshot will leave you unharmed.Yes, its early access, but that doesnt excuse the company and the shady marketing tactics- look up the relationship between Bluehole and Tencent, you will be surprised. This game has been utterly ruined by hacks and terrible optimisation. From someone who has consistenly played casually since the day of release, PUBG has never been in a worse state.

I was meeting new people and could play in a squad without a problem. At this point it is impossible for me to join the NA server without being teamed with multiple players from China that all seem to be best friends. I can not communicate with my team and this clearly decreases the game qualityfor me. Some people have suggested region locked servers. Do something about this. This has nothing to do with Xenophobia like the "genius" Greene so nicely suggested. We just want to be able to communicate with other players. Other than english, I speak some other european languages... Which does not make a difference because now the EU servers are full of chinese speaking people too. The developers nead to FIX this problem before the loose the US and EU userbase. The developers don't want to alienate chinese players because thats where they make their money... at the same time disregarding their old player base - which is why this game is popular in first place. At this time, I can not recommend this game.

Sometimes the game doesnt register the damage properly where I have been 1 shot by a kar98k with a lvl 3 helmet on with full HP. This game can be fun when you don't get bs all the time which happens a lot in this game, espicially with your friends.In conclusion this game has been done poorly, with the amount of money made the devs should be able to do so much more. The game is still too buggy and filled with lots of things that need to be fixed.

NSBstock	Not Recommended	807.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000240748/	It's not a bad game, but the team play is ruined by all the Chinese players on the North American servers.  Nearly impossible to find English speaking players on the NA servers.  Sucks the fun out of squad play.
NANGus	Not Recommended	288.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198134225139/	This game can be great fun. Unfortunately, 90% of the time its utter garbage. If you arent dying to someone with better ping than you or hacks you are running from the zone or enjoying the vehicles that are either abundant or non existent. Did I mention the simple act of going from flat grassland to an actual road can flip your car, if not utterly destroy it?Dont even bother with the hilly parts of the map, as you cant aim up while proned on a hill. Fog maps look like cancer, rain maps kill fps and the game is so horribly optimised that sometimes buildings will fail to load at all. If this happens to you, have fun seeing, and shooting through walls, as well as driving through them. If I didnt properly emphasise it, there is almost always a hacker on every server.  Sometimes there are hackers fighting each other for the main spot while you cower in a corner and hope to god that they somehow die before finding you. Aim hacks are bad enough, but speed hacks are plain insanity, impossible to hit and faster than your car. Then there is walls, lower tier aim hacks as well as loot hacks etc that make this game seriously frustrating.To address the better ping thing, Im not talking about just missing constantly and blaming lag. Im talking about shooting and getting blood splats, but not registering hits. Its happened to me both ways, shooting someone 3-4 times while they are running only for them to one shot you with a shotgun, and for none of that damage to register. Inversely, getting blood splats all over you but one tapping someone with a shotgun or headshot will leave you unharmed.Yes, its early access, but that doesnt excuse the company and the shady marketing tactics- look up the relationship between Bluehole and Tencent, you will be surprised. This game has been utterly ruined by hacks and terrible optimisation. From someone who has consistenly played casually since the day of release, PUBG has never been in a worse state.
Soap11x	Not Recommended	273.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198370309790/	I have been playing this game since it first launched in the Alpha phase. It was great and I loved playing it. I was meeting new people and could play in a squad without a problem. At this point it is impossible for me to join the NA server without being teamed with multiple players from China that all seem to be best friends. I can not communicate with my team and this clearly decreases the game qualityfor me. Some people have suggested region locked servers. Do something about this. This has nothing to do with Xenophobia like the "genius" Greene so nicely suggested. We just want to be able to communicate with other players. Other than english, I speak some other european languages... Which does not make a difference because now the EU servers are full of chinese speaking people too. The developers nead to FIX this problem before the loose the US and EU userbase. The developers don't want to alienate chinese players because thats where they make their money... at the same time disregarding their old player base - which is why this game is popular in first place. At this time, I can not recommend this game.

Fade	Not Recommended	399.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fade1414/	After almost 650 hours played on both Live and PTR combined. I just got done playing my 8th game in a row in 2 days where my team was killed my a Aimbot / Wallhacker. Yes, I know the difference between a good player and a hacker. Every single time, it's been an Asian player. Every. Single. Time. It's getting worse each day too.  I'm now disapointed to say I will not be playing this game anymore until 1 of 2 things happen, hopefully both.1. Latency Lock. 2. Much better cheat detection.A latency lock (also need to ban VPNs) would ensure that players from asia wouldn't be able to come to the US servers and hack, which is 99.999% of the hackers. This would also make getting killed behind walls a lot less frequent. Much better cheat detection is obvious and should happen either way. I have many great memories in this game, but it isn't even playable anymore. Hopefully they fix their♥♥♥♥♥♥before it gets even worse and the game dies.Current rating 3.5/10

Mercyless	Not Recommended	1,283.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016351241/	Great concept, but ruined by the amount of hackers in almost all games now regardless of server.
Faltri	Recommended	220.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FaltriTV/	GameplayThe game is really immersive when it comes to intense situatons, such as 1v1's or when you are in a fight against another player or squad. Over time you may come across funny moments or times when you may be confused on why the player you headshot 4 times did not die. The game is alot more fun with friends too, so that is what i reccomend doing. The gameplay overall is very good and it is something that i think everyone should experience. GraphicsNow we get onto the Graphics of the game. I play on Ultra settings when im on PUBG, but in order to get be fair, i will write my review with my experience on the graphic settings on Medium. The player models look great and the lines/polygons look very smooth. The render distance is pretty far when i jump off the plane, i can see most of the buildings below me, now the render distance may be different between me and you because of our specs, i use a GTX1060 6GB. The Dessert maps oof PUBG don't look as good as the Grass Map's, when i had first seen the dessert map, i thought i was playing on Low Settings, i was actually on Ultra. Overall, the graphics look great on ultra, and pretty good on Medium. Playing on Low still gives a good experience.DevelopmentI am happy to see that the PC 1.0 has been released, and has fixed lots of the problems i thought they would nevr fix before. I used to throw lots of hate to this game because of how poorly developed i thought it would be. But boy was i wrong, it is great to see that the game optimizaion is now better, now the lag is also reduced (still needs to improve a bit more though). The graphics have also been improved. Overall, the game is being developed slowly but with major changes to the game.CommunityNow, there are lots of players complaining about the chinese hackers and how disruptive other players may be. I have also experienced this. But not all chinese players are bad though. I cannot deny on how many toxic and salty players there are in the game, but if you do come across one though, there is always the option the report the player. Aside from the chinese hackers, PUBG has a lovely community on Twitch, Youtube, and etc. With lots of content being put out and streamers to watch.SummaryPUBG is selling tons of copies every day, and the player base of the game is outstanding! The game has the most viewers on Twitch, with more streamers now playing the game. There are not much signs of the game dying, and we must hope that the developers put effort on the development of the game. Overall, even if you don't really like the game that much, try it atleast. But i warn you, this game is addicting to some people so be aware!
Nick	Recommended	181.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ultranuke42/	I think this game could have a lot more features and improvements that could be made, but for a game thats only been out for about 6 months, I really enjoy it. Hope to see new improvements in the future!
Bobolightning30	Not Recommended	125.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137991767/	Good game. Decent performance. Bland concept. Good gunplay. Would recommend. Except for the fact that hackers sit at literally every corner of the map. Bluehole still hasn't done much to combat these hackers. Don't bother buying. Unless you like being shot behind cover from a guy 200 m away.
npbruns1	Not Recommended	522.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198143634060/	This game can be amazing. I have lost many hours of my time and I have loved it. Unfortunately as of late, there has been a HUGE freaking problem. There has been cheating like never before and it has gotten to the point where the game is unplayable. At least once an hour I see an aimbot or guy with a speed hack. I would love to kick back and enjoy this game but with all the cheaters that currently exist this game is almost rendered unplayable. HJGE negative until they fix it

Jaitsu	Not Recommended	37.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaitsu/	It's fun for as long as the sense of "I know why I died, I can do better next time!" lasts, but eventually the realization sinks in that every kill/death is a coin flip of who saw who first (with a slight bias toward who can aim better), because with no damage direction indicators beyond a sound that could be coming from any pixel in a 90-degree cone, you're usually dead in seconds before you have the slightest clue who's shooting you, no matter how long you've spent hunting down that elusive level 3 armor. Realistic? Maybe. Fun? Not in the slightest, aside from getting a kick out of trying the craziest ideas that come to mind and finding them just as (in)effective as the most thought-out strategies. Oh, and now you're liable to trade in your hard-earned points only to get a loot box you can't even open without cash.
MonKAY	Not Recommended	289.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/crazymonkay/	Currently I can't recommend to buy this game.The recent events show that the dev team opperates a report system that doesn't work at all and punnish people that are innocent.The latest switch on microtransaction crates before the full release and the whole PR appearance let the credibility of the Dev/Publisher vanish..
Weeniehutjunior	Not Recommended	455.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gheedox/	This Game is an absolutly great game, It consists of an emence amount of total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and a substantial amount of retardation. The game had potential but it decided to eat its own♥♥♥♥♥and suck its self off. When you just about the wina  game Network lag detected... Your side is find but the stupid servers are horrible. Furthermore The amounmt of Hackers and misuse of terms and conditions make the game feel very frustrating. I would highly recommend you dont play this game as its not worth the investment of time and money to wait for the problems to be fixed or patched. Trust me if you like getting aggrovated this is the game for you
Keitaro	Not Recommended	1,258.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Keitarooooooo/	Slow and lame updates. Sh*t servers with poor net codes. Ugly UI. Poorly optimized. Only fangays would disagree. *Would probably change my review. It depends with the future updates.EDIT: My thoughts on 1.0 UpdateYeah I can say it is optimized. BUT....... So they made other players blurry from afar which they look like just a dot or a blob of dirt and that's what they call optimization? For real? Also, the new map is like a gamble; big map full of nothing.PC 1.0 Update #7-They rolled back an important security/anti-hack update because they said it affects the performance. LOLTHINGS THEY SHOULD DO:-Update their signatures on a daily basis (yeah I know it's not that easy but who cares?) -IP ban/hardware ban hackers (IDGAF if selling to hackers is part of their money-making scheme; I don't want my game to be ruined by these hackers).-Remove/lessen the clothings spawned in the game. We don't even need it. -In Miramar, islands southeast of the map, there should be a boat/ aquarail on each.-Remove unnecessary props/clusters off the map. Some are just floating above the ground.

Voodoo	Not Recommended	792.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989949319/	Got this game at the very start and have loved every minute of it up until now, the gameplay its self is fine. for me the issues thats driving the fun factor of this game down is the hacks/cheats that are getting more and more frequent, before i would come across a hacker in 1 game out fo 20.. now it seems its almost every game, played 6 games back to back with a squad. 1st game had a guy with nothing but numbers for a name kill my whole squad in a split second with a pistol all head shots while we are moving at high speed in a car, two of us had lvl 3 helms others had lvl 2 second game came across a guy fireing the kar 98 like a AKM , randomly spraying and getting headshot kills. other games had speed hackers two guys running at stupid speeds panning people then vanishing as quickly as the apeard ..This claim that they are banning X amount of accounts per day i feel thats just a number they plucked out of thin air

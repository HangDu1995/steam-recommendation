Sky	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yoimafish/	My first game was with my friends at 11:00 PM. It lasted 3 hours to finish 1 game! Not to get to a score... but to finish 1 game. In the time that the UNO: movie took up, we completed 1 game! I see why it has psychological horror as a tag.
♕EndeRzzz♕	Recommended	9.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081647441/	Game is really fun with real humans,  but the bots are so rigged to ruin you. they always get the best cards always have things to counter what you're doing , and in classic they help eachother out . at one point them blocking two of my moves on a bot that was on uno as if they did it to save him .. its really stupid but other than that with friends and real people its fun.

Jazz the Gamer	Not Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/-jazz-/	I effing love Uno, but this game is definitely not worth buying. Granted, I should have paid attention to all the negative reviews and not take them as total bs. Unless you have friends who also own Uno, do not expect to play multi-player. The online multi-player quick match simply does not work 90% of the time, and even if it somehow manages not to crash, there's not that many players online to play against regardless. I would definitely recommend playing the demo, which is free and you can still play with like friends/family, but until issues are fixed, it's pretty much the only play-able version.
Dei	Not Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025225133/	The crashing on this game is unacceptable. How can a big company like Ubisoft get this so wrong? It's a simple card game for gods sake.
SugaRogue	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055531472/	 The Game DOES Work and is really fun with friends. Read Below..This game might induce seizures so don't buy if you have epilepsy, no I'm serious it warns you about it when you open the game. Anyways let's continue. I see so many reviews about ti "not working" or "not being able to play with friends" well here's an honest review which this game needs. UNO a fun family game played for generations, but with a twist. So I haven't tried a classic skin spread yet (because the other DLC skins are REALLY fun to play on). So right out of the gate you will notice you DO have to either log into your Uplay account or make one if you don't already have one. I logged into mine flawlessly and 2 people I know that played with me both had to make an account and it went fine for them. So either way you should be fine. The game also ran flawlessly except on a couple of the loading screens there was a little frame drop action going on for me and my friends, also for all of us when we closed the game it crashed instead of closing normally so there's that. However the game plays like a dream except for the couple second loading screens and closing it. If you are running it on a toaster or have crappy internet that's not Ubisoft's fault and trust me I'm the first one to call out a games faults and the shortcomings of any poorly ported game from any company. I've also seen people complain about controls. Yes, the keyboard DOESN'T work, but that doesn't mean you have to have a gamepad. The game from opening to closing is played with just your mouse. Every command is mouse based from calling UNO to calling bluffs to clicking cards it's all with your mouse. Just a normal mouse too, you don't need a fancy mouse..So getting into the game you'll notice they set you up with 2 deck skins already, Raving Rabbits and the classic UNO look. They also let you download a Winter skin for free too though, so that's 3 free skins/themes. You can buy a Rayman and/or Just Dance skin as well though. each skin/theme is unique, the bots are named after the game characters of the skin/theme with pictures of the characters, the special cards you can leave on (4 per skin/theme) or turn off are unique to each one. You can easily set up the rules when making a room or join a random room online. Neither or these lag. I made multiple games on a few of the skins/themes and it didn't lag for me or the two people I was playing with. It also didn't lag for me when I joined a random online room. The visuals, effects and music are also unique for each skin/theme. It's fun online, but eve more fun with friends to play it with. I'm not sure how I feel about it as a solo game but there are bots you can play with if you want to. Pros:+Visuals+Music+Variety+DLC that's worth that's price+Improved the original game+replayability Cons:-frame drops sometimes on the loading screen before a match-Crashes when you close it instead of closing normally-When you join a lobby it throws you into a random lobby, it'd be nice if you could choose instead
Wand of Inferno	Not Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wand_of_Inferno/	Get this game if it's on sale and get at least 3 friends to join you.Don't buy this game alone, unless you want to play online or again'st bots.Now, this game has many cons, such as crashing before loading a game or servers being slow, also the price of this game is dumb as it is.The only pros is making your friends feel like in Mario Party, ruining your Uno and getting you to 16 cards.Just buy it on sale, otherwise don't.
Synthesim	Not Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Synthesim/	If you are planning to play UNO offline it's all good, it gives you what you'd expect from UNO in a modern poppy design. If you plan to play online, I would not recommend buying this game currently, since it's heavily buggy. Disconnects happen on a regular basis You cannot choose which house rules or DLC you want to play if you are not hosting Voice chat has no push-to-talk-option Players disconnecting are constantly replaced and you might end up being a replacement Online matches are filled with KI players which should not be the purpose of online games 
Loli Hentai Lover	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lolihentailoversupreme/	Wow. Incredible. This game tops all other games. Not only has it smashed my expectations but it also has destroyed all its competition. For a game made by Ubisoft in 2016, you would expect this game to be a massive flop. Instead, UNO is the lifeforce of the modern gaming industry. After putting extensive time into this game, trying to better myself and my strategies, I thought I had reached peak enjoyment. For me, games get stale quickly, so to say it took a while for UNO to get boring, is a huge deal. But right when I started to feel like the game had peaked, BOOM, Rabbids DLC!In my opinion, there is no game that can compare to UNO, both in its quality in sound and graphic design and its immersiveness. It is the Dark Souls of casual gaming. It is the Super Smash Brothers of competitive table top gaming. It is the God Father of all recent games. Looking back now I see how many games have drawn inspiration from UNO, and have succeeded. Breath of the Wild, Cuphead, even Fortnite's battle royale gamemodes all draw clear and distinct inspiration from the success of UNO and it is for these reasons that UNO will forever be the #1 game in history.SPOILERS ABOUT THE GAME AHEAD Again, wow. This game is such a rush sometimes. From stacking plus two cards to crush your opponents and calling UNO before anyone else can to secure your own victory are just two of my favorite moments from playing UNO. I do have to be honest in my review and tell you that I do find the singleplayer campaign mode not as fun the second time playing, but it still kicks butt. UNO is a game that understands what players want, but more importantly what they don't want. Players don't want overwhelming lobbys of 100 users, or even more than 10 for that matter! UNO keeps it simple, at 4, and with seamless, crystal clear, voice chat, its easy to know who is who.After completing the singleplayer campaign three times, I assumed I had mastered the game, so I tried my hand and some multiplayer gamemodes. But, as I should have seen coming, UNO is a game that does not have a skill ceiling, it lets a good player be good. Which is why when I got into my first game, I was completely blown away by some of the strategies people were pulling, and the moves I had not yet seen be applied, even in the singleplayer campaign. I went from trying to place all of my cards in the stack before my opponents did, to having to jump in playing two of the same card, playing special cards to steal decks, and even using cards only available in the amazing Rabbids DLC to completely change the state of the game.UNO is fluid, it is living, and it will continue living until UNO 2 takes its place as the top tier game. Thank you for reading my review, again, for these reasons, I declare UNO as the #1 game of all time.

Metho	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Methosis/	The game feels very slow, even for Uno. It also feels very buggy. From my time playing it, I discovered people would still punish me for not pressing Uno, even after I did. The game also crashed multiple times when trying to connect to online, and sometimes just froze up while connecting. Not to mention, you have to play it through uplay, which is a bit annoying to be honest. I wouldn't recommend this if you're buying it alone. It might be fun if you buy it with friends.

LeMador [TH]	Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iium2000/	at first, i joined my voice to the negative reviews in hope that Ubisoft or Uplay would fix the online issues and present a better online experience.. however, after hours of good matches without any of those issues, i am reluctant to keep my review in the negative category..UNO is a great card game.. and i purchased this game despite of the amount of Negative Reviews it has receieved.. UNO is my favourite since my early childhood; and a deck of UNO cards is always ready in my living room for almost 2 decades.. but as friends grew apart, i can only play UNO online with people whom i've never met before..in my initial review, i gave UNO a 3/5 or a C-.. but after few hours playing this game, i can give it a revised review of 4/5 or a B+..the BIGGEST complaint about the game, is the online mutliplayer part of the game.. it is where you get most of the connection errors.. some as simple as being kicked out from a match in mid-game, and some as critical as closing the frozen game using the Task Manager (by pressing CTRL ALT and Delete)..`during online matches, i had the following:- 20% of the matches, i was kicked out from a match without an explanation..- 5% of the matches, i had a 'timed-out error' message..- 4% of the matches, the game had frozen on me that i had to use CTRL+ALT+DEL to escape the game..- 1% of the matches, i had "UNO.EXE has stopped working" error message..  so 3 out of 10 online matches, i was rudely interrupted from the game.. but 7 out of 10 matches, the game ran smoothly without any errors.. there are certain hours during the day, when those errors were completely gone.. but there are some hours when all the above occured around the same hour..`now let me talk about the positive aspects of the game..- the game is fun.. i had a big wide smile on my face playing this game.. Rabbids is definitely a great feature in the game that i have never experienced before.. - in the online multiplayer menu, you can join any random match that is already on the way.. or you can create your own match, of which you can choose which of sets of rules to keep in the game.. for example: you can turn-off the 0-7 swap-card feature, and switch on the 'No Bluff' feature..and then you can decide whether to make the match open for anyone to join in, or keep it private for only-friends to join in.. `if you have created a open match, with only you and one other player in the game.. you can choose to start the game with bots to fill the other 2 positions.. and within minutes, other people will replace those bots.. people can move-in and out anytime during a match replacing the bots or being replaced by bots.. and this happens smoothly..`3 out 10 matches, i had error messages while playing online.. and i can COMPLETELY understand why people are so critical of Ubisoft and Uplay..when the game freezes on you, and when you are being kicked-out from a very long challenging match, you are within your right to feel offended and outraged.. but then, you'll have those long matches where everything works as it should be.. so you will have the biggest smile on your face playing UNO..this game could have been 5/5 or an A-, if Ubisoft and Uplay can address the issued in this game.. and of they could find a way to introduce in-game chat-box to chat with other players..but because of those connection issues.. i give it a 4/5..

StrawBlurry Shortcake~<3	Not Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StrawBlurryShortcake/	If you have 3 other friends to play with then I would possibly consider recommending this. However that isn't nearly possible considering Ubisoft made this game. It runs off THEIR poor excuse of servers. You will need a Ubisoft account obviously to play but not only that, theres a 50-50 chance that the friend your trying to play with will even show up as online. The servers don't work properly so theres a good chance you won't be able to play with any of your friends. Not to mention the game is specifically set up to cater towards the AI as they will 100% of the time have a +4, +2, or a skip. All in all, this game is veeery difficult to recommend to anyone. Avoid if you're looking for an Uno game that allows you to actually play with friends & not have a high chance of failing to connect, not being allowed to invite them, or if you dislike Ubisoft.

rubydoom13	Not Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rubydoom13/	This Windows version is literally a trash can fire. Online doesn't work, constantly crashes. No patch in sight for fixing major issues. Can't search by game type, can only "drop in" to a random online game (I had about a 10% success rate of this game NOT crashing AND getting a game in online mode). Literally the worst game developed in history, i think. I didn't even pay for this game and I feel ripped off. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
ϟ SᗰOᒪ ᑎᑌGGᕮT ϟ	Recommended	92.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cferres/	I remember playing UNO a lot as a kid with friends and family, so when I saw this on Steam, I had to have it. I was a bit sceptical since the majority of reviews were mixed, but I just couldn't deny the nostalgia I felt.At first, my experience with this game was awful. I tried to play it on my old Windows 8 and it wouldn't run at all. Thankfully I had recently got a new Windows 10 and for the most part, it ran great on that.Sadly the game does have a few bugs in it. Sometimes when I'm playing an online round with friends or strangers the game will randomly freeze, which often ends with one or more people leaving. Sometimes It'll even randomly disconnect me from an online match. For some reason, these bugs never happen when I'm playing singleplayer and only happen online.But honestly, even with those bugs, it never stopped me from having so much fun with UNO, especially when playing with friends. As you could tell from how many hours I've played of this game, I'm addicted to it. I even brought the Rayman and Just Dance themed cards and they were a lot of fun to play. A casual card game from my childhood, sometimes that's all it takes to keep me entertained for hours.I recommend playing this game as long as you have a pretty good pc and you enjoy playing casual card games.

Etgamer™	Not Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Etgamer15/	I bought the game cause I loved playing Uno, friends had the game, I had the recommended settings and was ready to play. Only to get the game and find out that it usually crashes everytime I try to play an online game, and when I do finally play a game it's so ♥♥♥♥ing laggy that I can barely even function, it's bad when a simple card game cannot be run when I have the settings that it recommends not requires, Not only did they make an announcement before I even bought it that they were trying to fix their issues, but they never did fix any of the issues, Fix your game!!
☩Sparrow421	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sparrow421/	The biggest downfall to this is forced uPlay.Besides that the game is fun with friends with a few various rule changes like stacking draw 2's and bluffing along with some others im not familiar with.DIsconnect issues seem to be a thing with some people though it hasnt happened to me.I really wish a chat feature was in this game and perhaps an online lobby for chatting.Besides those few small issues this game is fine and being able to play uno online brings me back to playing it on xbox live arcade on my 360. It's pretty much everything i expected.
ScottishMutt	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/scottishmutt/	Do not get it. Unless you're familiar with the way UPlay works and you're OK with it, do NOT get this game.If Mattel had licensed *anyone* else to develop this game, it'd be fine - but somehow Ubisoft found a way to make Uno for PC an unenjoyable experience. The game is prone to crashing, the menu's framerate is so slow; it's actually slow to respond, which just seems ridiculous for a card game. Get it for PlayStation, Xbox, or whatever console variant is out there, but the PC version is absolute dog pile simply because UPlay is anti-user-friendly.
Gamingman	Not Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022658933/	Good fun game but resolution is locked to max 1080p, online is broken constant disconnects and game crashes often as well, so sorry to say but skip this for technical reasons.

Lemanemone	Not Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121559491/	I am sure that others would enjoy the game, although I found it very unpleasant. Usually I am a big fan of the card game and I absolutely love watching videos of youtubers playing it, such as Minx and her friends, however this game was just extremely unenjoyable for me. I found it much more bland and boring than I expected it to be and I would not play it again.However, that is just my personal opinion on how I felt when I played it. I would love to recommend it, but I was just too disappointed from this experience. I am sure many find the game to be the bee's knees and such, probably all the people who actually have friends to play it with perhaps, or other reasons, that I can't really think of at the moment.But me? I think I'll stick to my Uno cards that I have. In a box. Not a screen attatched to a box. Nahhh. Just a small box.

¿Por Que?	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/very_loki/	PRO- Joining online games is good. - Lots of customized cards with the dlc's.- Instructions were clear on how to play the game.- Very simple layout, perfect for using a controller or mouse.CON- Creating an online game isn't good. When I did it, it only gave me the option to leave the lobby and not start the game when I had a full lobby.- Because you're using the ubisoft uplay app in connection with steam your player icon and name can be different, or even no player icon at all. you have to go through the process again of opening uplay and editting your player icon on their website.- Couldn't figure out how to make a comment whilst the game was in play.CONCLUSIONThis is a fun game even if you don't play with your friends, I'll continue to play. Though it would be nice if I could create a lobby and start said lobby. The only way I see playing with friends is if you join a game at the same exact time and hope you all get put into the same lobby.Thankfully I haven't had any crashes or disconnections unlike some of the reviews that i've seen.EDITSo i've had a few disconnects and times where a player has also disconnected but the game lags into bringing in a bot takes roughly 5 minutes to bring in a bot of someone who has disconnected, but no lag when someone is taking over a bot.But it hasn't ruined my perspective of the game, i just hope they can do a major update to fix the games lag issues and random disconnects, plus I still can't start an online game with me being the host no idea why that is, the button to 'open the lobby' once clicked, it goes away and doesn't reveal the start game button, which is annoying.I also had a time where i clicked someones profile whilst in game and it wouldn't let me leave and the game kept going, 3 turns later i was kicked.
Handeril	Recommended	122.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHanderil/	To be clear from the start, I mainly recommend this game due to how much fun it's been to play when annoyances haven't happened.First off, the game is pretty entertaining in it's own right, you can play around with all sorts of "house rules", which are rather-difficult to pull off in real life (I would know from experience, as I actually played games with some of these "house rules" long before this game came around).There's also various DLC Card Decks, which "spice up" the game in some interesting ways. (They should try to add at least one more, since big Youtubers are covering the game at this time.)So you can play the normal UNO you know and love from your childhood, for the most part, or you can play with all sorts of crazy "house rules" which add all sorts of new challenges.However, after the good, we have the "gray zone", the game does have some noticeable bugs, some of these include the UNO button bugging once in a while (it's a 1 out of 20 case for me), not being able to invite friends to a match after sending the invite once (1 out of 10 chance, since the U-Play update a while ago), and a 1 in 1,000 chance occurence of a +4 not working one time.The game isn't perfect, but we loop back to "It's a game", and sometimes stuff just "goes wrong".Finally, though, we go to an interesting, and rather annoying, list of issues that do interrupt gameplay.1. If you have a weak connection, you may get kicked at the start of a match! - Legitimately, this happens, and I noticed it mainly happens to wireless users. It can still happen to people who use an internet cable, however, it seems to be less-likely. :/2. If you are kicked, the host has to completely-restart the lobby.- It would be nice if you could re-join the lobby, if you were kicked, in the middle of a game, when/if the host re-invites you. Less time would be used up trying to make sure everyone can play from the start, and people could re-join if they got booted for going AFK.3. The "Keep this card?" prompt lags horrifically.- I'm on a pretty high-end computer, and even some Youtubers run into the issue of the game hanging when you are prompted of whether you want to keep a card or not. To add insult to injury, you can even crash (which means you leave the game and the host has to restart), or you can get kicked (which leads to the same scenario).One issue I did notice Ubisoft kind-of fixed was servers full-on "derping out" and just, well... "hanging", to say the least.It still happens, but it's not as often as usual, so I'm just kind-of assuming they fixed something which reduced the amount of times this happens.In the end, the game is 10 dollars, so any game within that range could be amazing, or horrible.This game falls "dead middle" between the two, in my opinion.So, do I recommend it? Yes! It's reasonably-priced, you can play with 3 of your friends in FFA or 2v2, and while it has it's bugs, at least the base game only costs 10 dollars.However, I am talking US-dollars, and I am sure there's countries where it'll cost even less to buy this game.In such a case, go for it!Though, if you're in a country where the game is noticeably-expensive because of the US Dollar being worth more than your native currency, I would only recommend this game if you are absolutely sure about it!My rating for this game is 6 out of 10, and if the following features are added, I'm sure I'd rate it much higher (and others might be happier as well): - Players being able to re-join mid-game if/when the host re-invites them. - Try to remove/reduce the lag that comes with the "Keep Card/Play Card" prompt - Maybe 1 new DLC Card DeckOtherwise, have fun, ladies and gentlemen!
wrb41977	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069159152/	This is the semi-classic game of UNO! now on computers. you can play against AI opponents, or against other people. There are also a series of house rules that can be used (some of which are rather... odd). Not much else to say about the game itself.Do note: This is produced by Ubisoft. This means you will likely have to join their Uplay program if you aren't a part already. And that also might be the source of all the crash issues some reviews comment on. (Sort of like trying to play a game that needs Steam without having Steam.)
Vixy	Not Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vixy88/	This game is a lot of fun to play, but it still has a lot of bugs in it. The game with glitch, crash, or sometimes not even load often. In my case, I was able to get around all this because you sometimes had to be patient with the game. Recently, however, the game will not let me OR my friends host a game because it says "Your NAT setting have been set to STRICT". All of us tried the multiple ways to possibly correct this, but all in vain. None of us can host a game now and has since made the game worthless to all of us. In other words, you can buy this game, hoping to get around it's usual funks and host a game before you too will not be allowed to host games or else just play with some random people before it crashes in the middle of a game. A lot of these problems DID NOT SHOW UP IMMEDIATELY; many came after a few weeks of play and for my group of friends, it usually happened to one person at a time.
Bar	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/s_c_u_l_l_y/	Online feature doesn't even work, nice work UbiSoft.Seeking a refund right now.
That British Bear	Recommended	59.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatBritishChick/	Fun game with friends. I did notice that when I would play the game with a friend that one my screen my friend would randomly leave but on their screen I would randomly leave and we did not know what happened and had to start a game again when we were in the middle of one. After time I still do not know what that problem actually is.A common bug between friends is their games keep crashing randomly while playing and doing all the generic stuff to sort things like that out (uninstalling and reinstalling/valiating the files) does not work and they still have this problem.
Layla Darkwood	Not Recommended	105.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LaylaDarkwood/	I do this with a heavy heart.. I really enjoyed this game and I thought it had potential, I still like playing it here and there with my friends if it works...But these days it doesn't even work anymore especially lately, and there's no good reason for it. It has quite a few bugs and issues. AI *cough cough* and the servers *cough cough*They force you to use the Uplay program and overlay even though the Steam one should work just fine, they also force you to unlock some pretty useful features via Uplay points (like the jump in feature etc). The aesthetic ones are fine to do that with, but things that can really be a game changing feature? Please NO. Just no..There's also how both me and my friends have been having these ridiculous issues which makes just trying to play together nigh impossible and there's no real support of any kind where we can go for info or help to try to solve it, and even so I don't think these issues are on our end anyways because their servers are horrid and we've done everything you can imagine to try and fix it.Oh also the devs never seem to update or patch ANYTHING at all EVER. Literally I cannot think or remember a SINGLE time where Uno was updating or had been updated..Plus it's very dead..I really did like the game, it could've been so much more or it could've at least been consistently enjoyable for me and my friends. However sadly it just has too many issues to really recommend it to anyone, for now. :(

Rare80	Recommended	17.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rare80/	I recommend this game, but boy it that tough.  Can't tell you how many time I get kicked out of matches for seemingly no appearent reason.  It was a problem that I thought I could resolve by switching to a wired connection instead of using Wi-Fi, but that has not been the case.  A shame that I have usually run a heathy 30 FPS on this game since the switch.As for the the game itself, It's fxxkin' Uno, okay?That being said, $10 is a bit of a steap price and I've had no luck getting my other Steam friends to buy it because of the price.  All in all, it's a good way to kill a boring hour.
Pappagiorgio	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087077872/	It manages to be less exciting and has less features than the free mobile version by Gameloft, somehow, unfortunately that game got too convoluted with dumb, unnecessary, ridiculously childish♥♥♥♥♥♥like 'pets' to make it more appealing(?) and I guess to keep it fresh to newer, younger generations while alienating many. So I hoped this version had enough stuff, without going overboard, while mantaining cohesion. Sadly, to a longtime UNO fan like me, it isn't the case.This Ubisoft version mandates the dreaded Uplay, and if that wasn't enough of a hassle, to add insult to injury, not being happy with you forking $10 Euros to Ubisoft, when you're playing with the standard deck, out of a sudden, randomly, when you draw a card you might come across one that ♥♥♥♥s up with everyone's cards, advertising Rayman's paid DLC deck. Appalling! Imagine a racing game where you're driving in any given track and then, all of a sudden, a car materializes besides you, rams you over the track and a message pops up telling you to buy that car that just crashed into you. Unbelievable, isn't? Well, that's what you get with Ubisoft here.Refunded.
Mister Gamer	Recommended	259.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gamemessenger47/	Aweee the good old card/board game fun for all ages! This game is a lot of fun but if you play against computer AI bos then you'll be fine. But if you play UNO against real players or your friends, prepare for friendship(s) to be broken and forever destroyed... xDBut in all seriousness, this game is a lot of fun and some of the custom rules for this UNO game makes the game even more challenging and requires you to be strategic. I highly recommend this game if you're a die hard UNO fan either it's the Steam game version or the physical real life card/board game UNO! :)
paradoona	Recommended	2.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fiqqhure/	I lost all my friends because of that game, truly recommended
ghost trick	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106807414/	Ok so this version of Uno is just awful play uno freak a browser game is 100% better.- requires Uplay- the multiplayer connection is awful- crashed when connecting- cant play a game of 1v1 or 3- its very slow
Lethal ❤	Not Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lethal_overdose/	Absolutely horrible. First it was a pain in the butt to link my steam account to uplay just to bind the damn game to play it but then you find out you cant even find anyone online to play it with (I can't be the only one trying to play this)  not to mention you also have trouble playing with friends who also have this ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game. Waste of money... Highly disappointed!!!! However I would recommend this game to my worst enemy.
selenityxoxo	Not Recommended	9.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/selenityxoxo/	You can NEVER connect to any online players, I could sit there for hours in a lobby I created or even just searching for an empty lobby and nothing ever happens. Totally not worth the $10 to play against AI's. I want my money back -.-
Lola Da Vinci	Not Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thecolourofmusic/	Me and a few friends bought this game thinking it would be something fun to play for a few laughs. Instead we just got frustrated. Trying to invite your friends to a game, having the game successfully start, and have all players finish the game turned out to be impossible. If you can manage to get through the irritating task of getting all your friends in the same lobby without anyone being kicked for no reason or the game crashing, you are already lucky. Sometimes once you select to start your game, it just crashes for no reason. If this doesn't happen, then it is most likely that either you or at least one of your friends will drop out in the middle of a game and be replaced by an AI. I bought this game at full price, and unfortunately I wouldn't even recommend it on sale. It was unplayable. If it was just me experiencing these issues, I could possibly say that my computer just didn't like the game, but each of my friends had the same problems. I really wanted to like this game, but it just has too many issues.
Whiskers	Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiskersTC/	Honestly, I don't know why people don't recommend this game. I rarely get issues. The only issues I've had are:The quit game button dissapears randomly. (Easy to fix)Sometimes I will click the UNO button, but it doesn't work.This game is great. I highly recommend.
mattymt21	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mattymt21/	I do not recommend this terrible product, dont waste your time or money. I had this game try to connect to online and it kept saying there was no network, then it bluescreened. i restarted it to get back into online for it to freeze again.I seen it had mixed reviews but i didn't think it would be that broken. 
FieraFox	Not Recommended	0.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198811272784/	Requires a Ubisoft account, and Ubisoft's website fails every time I try to log in with the new account I created, even after I reset the password again.I also see now that it requires both Steam and Uplay to be running at the same time for DRM purposes. What could go wrong?
Sparkplug	Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198230332092/	DON'T BUY IF YOU WANT TO PLAY AGAINST ONE PERSON ONLY! IF you want to play with 4 people or yourself then ye Buy it!  It is amazing at killing time and more!
GamingBread	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198261897411/	This game is not worth $10 cause you cant find anyone cause of the♥♥♥♥♥♥servers and you cant do anything but play with AI which is not what anyone played for and you should check reviews before buying like i did.

If you search for a multiplayer game, it doesn't find it. If you create one and wait till someone joins in, it doesn't ever happen. If you have friends that own this game, then it's fun to play.

SQUAWK	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/doomfisthere/	For all the 140,610 hours I've lived this game by far has taken the cake. This game doesn't break friendships as the myth foretold, but instead this game creates bonds greater than even your own family, greater than your own blood. When you play UNO it's like you've transported yourself to a whole new reality free from the chains of society. You're truly free when you play UNO. When a person, a human is born, they're given a role in which "God" decides fits for them; But when you play UNO that role is diminished and you're free from "God" because UNO is your God. You must obey by the rules and fight to be the best victor to be able gain any respect amoung your peers. UNO gives us freedom, UNO gives us choices, and UNO gives us life..

RachelSama	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198329692885/	It's really fun! just like the classic card game we know and love! the only downside is the new rules they added to it that dont really make much sense. However they give you the option to disable them if you dont like them so thats a plus.
Wheat_Grinder	Not Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wheat_Grinder/	Uno is a buggy piece of crap.Even if you accept that it's UPlay (which honestly isn't that much of a dealbreaker), the game will, at every turn, function against expectations. I saw one time where a certain player, no matter what action occurred, had to pick up two cards after every play. Another example is going down to one card on a play-in: You don't have the option to Uno ahead of time so when you go to click it afterwards you will almost never actually hit it.Just play with actual cards.
skydiamand	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085207298/	Spending 10 euro for uno is just to mutch.And you don't even get all the features: extra skins + gamerules need to be bought as dlc.If 10 euro wasnt enough, no you need to buy dlc to get the minimum out of your game.Also you can't change your keybindings and the default bindings are just stupid: U for calling uno and C for challenging uno.The music doesn't fit the game and is repetetive and the annoucers are just poorly executed.You're better of paying for other games that support card games like table top simulator or many others.

This is one of those.I bought UNO, because I was excited to witness the nostalgia of playing UNO video game on my PS3 with random people. It surely was entertaining and fun at times...This release of the famous card game is so unpolished that it makes me sad. Ubisoft is known for being an anti-consumer company. They even released a video game of Monopoly and people complain about the same things there.The first thing that catched my eyes when I opened the game was ''Powered by Unity.'' You can see from there that this game is just a sad cash-grab. Well, I tried to join an online match, but the game crashed over and over again. I tried to find help and most they said was: ''Turn off your anti-virus software.'' Well I tried that after and still was crashing. I knew just to give up and refund the game.Stay away from this and play the real card game instead.

Hello Kritty	Not Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hellokritty/	Ahh UNO, a game reminds me of playing with my brother when we were younger bored out of our minds or on a family trip.  This games has all the preset rules to the different styles of play that  you can choose to turn off or on.  Uno also has different playable decks, DLC, which allow for a unquie set of rules and animations which makes the game fun.......  WHEN YOU CAN PLAY.  THIS GAME CRASHES LIKE NO OTHER GAME I HAVE BROUGHT..  I can't believe they would put out a game like this for $10.00.  This is the first serious review that I have done and I can say with all honesty, do not buy this game until they do a major update to fix the crashing and ablitity to play online with friends.
God's Not Dead	Recommended	15.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/asotc/	No problems at all with the multiplayer.  Haven't had the game crash or hang up; moreover, I have no problem with UPlay and can wait the 5 seconds for it to start and load the game.  Spent almost two hours playing last night trying to get to 300 points so the Achievement Hunter struggle became hysterically real.  I feel for DGeoff, LilJ, GavinoFree, and Jack.

SSJ_DMAN	Recommended	24.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198855283638/	A polished version of a card game classic with the ability to play everything from a classic game to a hectic gameplay style involving swapping hands stacking cards and even some unique decks that add even more versatility and stress to an already frantic game the presentation is clean and easy to understand the soundtrack in particular is incredibly well suited to the game and gives a very relaxing and chill vibe in game voice and video chat is a nice touch and as well as controller support Which gives you some neat features such as a colour sort button as well as a dedicated UNO and draw Button. My only real complaints are the net code can be a bit spotty at times and randomly drop you or other players out of matches for seemingly no reason however the automatic switch from bots to players do help alleviate the situation somewhat in that no match will run out of players at least also the ability to only have four players that a time is a little disappointing and the DLC is a little overpriced but does add some unique cards that change up the game somewhat as well as new themes with appropriate music All in all whether you're looking to play a classic game a very know or add more variety and challenge this is definitely a game to enjoy especially if you can persuade a couple of friends to grab a copy and join you if not though there is a pretty healthy online community and finding a match or hosting a match was never a struggle highly recommended

Inaudios	Not Recommended	22.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198143233334/	While I don't have a lot of hours put in this game, I have had a lot of issues with disconnecting from a game, or having friends disconnecting while playing. UNO is a fun game to play with friends, but the constant disconnecting ruins the fun, and that is why I can't recommend this version of UNO in it's current state.
Debjit_M	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/debjitmukherjee/	First off, I had no idea how to play UNO and I bought it anyway.The tutorial was really helpful and I had no trouble learning how to play this game.There are plenty of game modes and the game allows you to create your own rules before starting the game both in single-player and in multiplayer. All of the sounds this game has are very relaxing and suits the game pretty well.You can play solo against AIs or invite your Uplay friends to play with them or just start a open multiplayer match where players can join and leave mid-game but thankfully once someone leaves, the AI takes over their place until another player comes.The only thing it's missing is a chat option with other players and not just your Uplay friends via Uplay and not the game itself.The player-base of this game is not huge if you're buying it for multiplayer. It's also worth mentioning that there's no waiting option to start a multiplayer match - you can start with AIs and people could join afterwards.Get it, you can play offline and online with your friends or other players.
The Sultan of Salt	Not Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198150010261/	Actaul Garbage. A server made out of a potato, ran by a monkey, who bangs a banana against the potato would run better than the servers for this♥♥♥♥♥♥game. Was trying to play with friends but would constantly kick me out of the server before we could start a game. This went on for about 20 minutes before we gave up and decided to play Uno on Tabltop Simulator. Would not recommend this to anyone except those who wish to waste money on a barely functional game. If you want to play Uno with your friends go buy Tabletop Sim. It has more options and is 1000x more stable.

Conrado DecoMorreno	Not Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047496165/	DISCLAIMER: English isn't my first language.The only in my opinion adventage this game has is that it works fine as a simple card game.Disadventages:1. Stupid paid DLC gamemodes which includes new theme cards. If I click the "Classic match" button, then I want to play a CLASSIC MATCH, not any gamemode such as Rayman, Rabbids or Just Dance. I can't choose lobby which I want to join. The game forces me to auto join lobbies where there are the most players. 2. The "UNO" button made to say "UNO" while there is a need to do it. It appears only when I have two cards left and I'm about to discard one of them. People have to be really blind to not notice it. The same thing concerns to the catch button, made to catch someone on forgetting to say "UNO".3. The community... People are annoying because they buy those DLCs, the popular rule 7-0 also makes me want to quit the game. Ubisoft knows how to make an easy cash grab for brainless people. I feel like I was one of them, because seems to be alot better to hang out with friends and play this game in it's non-electronic state.4. Ubisoft's servers.

Samantha	Not Recommended	3.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ziqolu/	It's fun until you realize you can't actually play online. Enjoy getting constantly disconnected, random crashes, et cetera! I've never made it through a single round online.If you just want to play local, then you shouldn't really have any problems. The bots aren't the best and don't know what to do properly if you enable certain modes, but it's not a horrible experience.
Weapon G	Not Recommended	16.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Weapon_G/	Unless you're only intending on playing against the computer or against friends and family that will fill up a group I highly recommend against purchasing this game. In my first online match I discovered that there is no timer in between turns. Once I called Uno, one player disconnected, and the player immediately before me has refused to play his card for a whole hour. This is ridiculous.I've moved onto contacting Ubisoft over this, recorded the lack of gameplay, reported the player, and they act like nothing can be done. I've made reasonable recommendations towards adding a timer in between turns. Players will just abuse the lack of this feature to avoid losses. By no means is this any fun.

Nuclear_Roach64	Not Recommended	1.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198250787176/	Couldn't connect with friends, or any online game, properly due to a NAT setting error. No other game that I have owned in my entire life has had a problem with my NAT type except Ubisoft's own Uno. I even gave it the benefit of the doubt and played with my router settings to no avail. I'm sure its fun when you actually play the game, but trying to connect to someone, anyone, is completely and utterly broken. I doubt theres any patchwork coming to fix it either so, do what thou wilt.

Crimson Lobstrosity	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/crimsonlobstrosity/	This is the most calmly infuriating game that I have ever played.My friends and I have gotten less angry over games of CS:GO and that is saying something, however, this game is excellent.It's exactly what you would expect, it's Uno, with some swish, high quality animations and some great customisable rulesets. The controller support is also very much welcome in a game where I'd rather launch that through the monitor than my mouse and keyboard.There's even some theme packs that I am yet to look into, but the 'Rabbids' pack that came with the game is brilliant fun to try out, occasionally due to all of the extra power-up cards and absurd visuals it brings with it. If the other packs bring this much enjoyment, then I will be sure to purchase them in the future too.But for now, I have had significantly more fun with this £7.99 game than I have had with many other games of five times that price, and I would give it a glowing recommendation.If you have friends willing to play it with you, anyway, as the bots are pure, unadulterated evil.10/10 - My friendships are weaker/stronger because of Uno.

✪Sprød Misser✪ (⌐■_■)	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Crispykitten/	I have recently bought this game after i've watched Markiplier and jacksepticeye play it!And after 4,3 hours of gameplay.. i still got no complaints about the game??Alot of reviewers in here, seems to have crappy computers or internet-connections.. because.. i havent encountered any problems at all..  a bit of a dissapointment that theres no achievements associated with steam at all.. but instead U-play, or ubisoft has to offer achievements which u can use for medals and so on!but overall it is a nice game with a nice touch to it... fun to play with friends... and a fun variety of DLC which makes the game alot more entertaining to play!  ofc.. do people find it annoying to pay for the DLC to make the game more competitive.. but u have to remember that u are paying another brand for content which wasnt originally included in the game in the first place!But i can ensure u! that u have to buy this game! 4/5 (because of the price)

I swear I have played a full game of Monopoly that has lasted shorter than this.  This game is pergatory for card games.

Phillyk1992	Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Phillyk1992/	Literally never had a problem with it so far, as far as it goes for people complaining in the reviews regards buying for mac or having 32 bit systems. Why leave a negative review based on your neglience to read 2 simple things.... Is it available for my operating system? and will it work on my computer? Your idiocy kills game communities because of bad reviews and your choice to play on a toaster or a mac, you should know better
Mr Käser	Not Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrkaser/	What should I say about it? It‘s an UNO game!It has a good design and all, but it has many bugs which destroy the entire game and fun. A friend of mine (yes I didn‘t loose them yet) can only play 3 rounds, then the game isn‘t synchronized anymore and he gets replaced by a bot and we have to start anew.Plus, you can only play this game with 4 people and if you play with less, you get one or more bots. In reality, you can play this game with how many people you want, as long as you have enough decks, which is not a problem in a computer game.In a nutshell: don‘t buy this unless you know it works for you and your friends and if you have friends to play it with! Wait until the bugs get fixed and you can play with more than 4 people.This review may get updated depending on fixes etc...Edit: An audio driver update fixed the issue with the crashing game.

NOCTUS | The Drifting 6	Recommended	3.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/boogywoogumsYT/	K I don't care what you peasents that keep saying "it crashes me" or "its made by ubisoft so its bad" or "ubisoft ruined uno" for gods sake just use trial and error is it that hard? its old, 2016 is pretty old and that means almost 2. almost 2 complete years. Even then I do believe more dlcs would be fun. Anyway heres my opinions on it.Although it doesn't crash for me my computer is quite crap. If you keep crashing check if your computer is worse than mine or if your being an idiot trying to do something at the same time as playing uno.I do feel that people whine to much about the "no online matches found." again like i said earlier this games almost 2 complete years old. Doing so this game will more than likely not have random online matches. Vanoss Gaming im sure is the dude who dragged most of us onto this road eh? eh?? am i not wrong about that.Uno is a lovely game for anyone and is very fun to play no matter what. if you dont like the rules of 7-0 or stacking just remove them its not that hard to do is it? and if you cant find online matches play with bots or get friends who have the game again not that hard. the games cheap as all hell for how much time you can get out of it.

Now I'm refunding your trash game because you were overly concerned with people trying to pirate Uno, when you should've been concerned with people having fun playing Uno.Suck my nuts Ubisoft.

House rules are really fun and a great way to spice up a classic game.However, Ubisoft kinda abandon this all together, with some new DLC and some bug fixes this would be great. In it's current state I can't really recommend this game unfortunatlyIf you love uno and are willing to put up with basically only playing with bots and willing to deal with constant crashes and gltiches, then you may like this.

dadsNEEDdabs	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dvdp1aya/	IT COMES WITH RABBIDS UNOI love Rabbids.My 3 yr old son loves Rabbids.It's worth $10 right there.There aren't many visual assists, so it's a pretty hardcore version of UNO.It's definitely the best UNO ever made.I play with TWO RULES:  Stacking.  And Force Play  (keeps the game moving faster.)If it's 2v2 i keep Forceplay Off.I've been playing Multiplayer Rabbids.  It is matchmaking so it's pretty quick connecting.I prefer to HOST and wait a few minutes for it to populate, because of the rules.You can invite friends and it has video chat.In 2v2 online multiplayer and you can see your teammates hand.  But god forbid someone quits and you get a temporary A.I.  Because sometimes they won't call UNO! and draw two.  I'm pretty sure the A.I. bluffs too.I MISS STREET FIGHTER HD UNO!  (i had it on my old xbox)This def makes up for that loss.I hope they make more DLC!!  Minions?  Sonic Boom?  Street Fighter V?  Tekken?Bottom line, it's worth it.I have way more things to b*tch about in my life.Rather than complaining and holding a grudge against UPLAY.  Just play.

Liam	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/arcticrune/	How did ubisoft ♥♥♥♥ up UNO? I mean it's UNO.  The online functionality is even more nonfunctional than I'd expect from a Ubisoft title.  I can't finish a game with my friends online without it crashing, and my last computer overheated so much that it melted the graphics card while playing this... WHY DID IT GET THAT HOT?? ITS UNO MY GOD.  Anyway. Just get Tabletop Simulator, its $20 and gives you acess to every board game in existance. Music is nice tho, I can listen to it while my computer burns my house down and kills my family  ('_')
Zoplexity	Not Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198295451922/	The game has good graphics and nice animations but what ruined it and is why im refunding it is because the bots win every time. I played for 80 minutes and won 2 matches. They have insane luck and win 99% of the time. It makes the game not fun.
Autumn ❤	Not Recommended	3.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/binkstg/	I literally went ♥♥♥♥ing mental playing this. Don't play unless you want to ruin your friendship. Gonna shoot myself.
ckpotato	Not Recommended	5.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CheekyPotato/	Not a game I can recommend in it's current state, if you're looking for the full UNO multiplayer experience.Game is plagued with bugs (typical Ubisoft game then) mainly on the multiplayer side. Lots of issues connecting with friends and partying up.If you don't intend on hosting your own lobbies with custom settings and to instead just join random ones, or play offline -then this is probably passable for you. Personally, I'd wait until Ubisoft release a patch.Game also has no online ranking elo system (unlike it's XBLA console version from 09') and all achievements are bound to Ubisoft's Uplay.Less said about Uplay, the better...There is no video settings, other than resolution and brightness; together with controls leads me to believe this is just a straight port of the console version from last summer.Real shame. If only a little more effort had gone into this version, I'm sure it would have been heaps better.
jamesfromit	Not Recommended	0.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jamesfromit/	Singleplayer was fine but multiplayer crashes a lot. The game also crashed while I was in the menu. The game is nicely designed but the crashing let's it down.
life-model-decoy	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lifemodeldecoy/	I can play versus the AI no problem, offline or online in order to get the xp and achieve medals etc. But like everybody else, I have problems connecting to other players. If I search for a game, it just says 'searching' forever and never connects me to anybody. If I host a game and open the lobby for others to join, it seems they can join, but it looks like they can't actually play; they just time out until the AI takes over from them. Once these issues get addressed, is got the potential to be great, but until then, it's a good single player time waster. I don't want to write it off too soon purely because I am able to play, and I do enjoy it, it's just the are some bugs that need fixing before everybody can be satisfied.

However, I reset it and NOW IT ONLY STAYS ON MY SUPER TINY SCREEN I ATTACHED! and more issues that would take too long to list... *Sigh*I am now requesting a refund.

[PCMR] Davic	Recommended	38.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Blackoutzzshoot/	This game is totally worth the price including all the dlc that adds many new cards and option to the gamemode. Playing this game on xbox live was totally a classic with friend using an xbox live vision camera. It's also the first game from ubisoft that doesn't really crash or that will never deceive you. Playing with friends is totally the key for few hours of good time.Good Points : You will always play again , there is no time limit on this game . Amazing animations and gamemode editor. We can play 2 vs 2 which is totally awesome to get the party started and 10$ for this game is totally a joke (Worth)!.  Bad Points : Impossible to share a webcam with everyone only with friends , but that's still fun. There is no way to filter what kind of game you are looking for. Lack of groups to join a game if you want to play 2 vs 2 , there is like no way to invite your friend to search for a game.

The game will like 99% of the time crash on finding your first online game a restart usually fixes this but even then sometimes it will lock up within the game and youll have to leave. Dunno how you ♥♥♥♥ up simple uno but you managed to do so. Cant reccomend in the current state.

Shadow Team	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zly1991/	new to uno. i have to admit this card game is fun and after 10 minutes play, i got all the rules, very easy.so the game is very good, but online experience is pretty bad, always disconnect from the host, sometimes the game just hangs there, i cant play and others have no responses too, i click menu icon to try to quit to lobby, but not working, i must quit the whole game.if all those online issues are fixed, this could be a really good good game.
SocialGamer	Not Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/socialgamer/	The game is very buggy and crashes non-stop. Last night I hosted my own hame had people join in played like 4-5 games and boom crashed. when I look for a game to join it crashes and everytime it crashes, it asks me to please send this error message/error number to the developers?! What do you think I am tech support or a beta tester. It's not it's an easy link with the error. I would have to look up on the internet and find the feedback area to then leave the error report somewhere ... "I think" ... I wanted this simple game so badly...but I can't recommend it untill somebody over at Ubisoft can fix the game. I have a "monster" gaming rig. 32GB of ran should be enough to runt this game and yes I have an 8-Core CPU and crossfire R9 390x and Windows 10 pro 64-bit.Friend's list is on Uplay not Steam as well......!  Great potential but very buggy and crashes often.Please.. please...pleaseeeee.....fix one of my favorite all time games. This version has MIC voice chat with the option to limit it to friends only or everyone...but the Webcam Video Chat (which is boss!) is limited to friends only and not public. But, as we all know...some people don't know how to act online so I see why it's like this.

JOKESTER215	Not Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JOKESTER_215/	DAMN YOU EA FOR THE LACK OF CONTENT THAT YOU GIVE ME FOR THIS EXPENSIVE UNO GAME!!! (probably better uno games online that is FREE -.-
yankeyunk	Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yankeyunk/	Lots of negativity in the comments about this game, but it looks actually pretty polished. Played 2 hours and only had one match where the game hang because someone was rejoining, but he wasn't. It looks great, it plays great. You get a "free" dlc pack with the rabbits thing which brings new cards/mechanics in the game. If you're on the edge, just buy it. you can always refund it if you're having problems in the 2 first hours. I'd most certainly recommend it!Also yes it requires uplay. It don't see the big deal around it. I Aactually like the account/achievement/unlock progression in Uplay.
BlueW0LF	Not Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198798957134/	This game is cancer it cause me to want to kill myself i can't even join a game without lagging out in two seconds now every time i see a UNO card i get ptsd and i start to scream and cut my wrist until i hopefully die

WaZi	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WaZi_TV/	This game just shows that Ubisoft does not care about customers at all. I bought this game to play with my buddies. I looked past the Mixed reviews since I know we have some problems with Ubisoft's Monopoly (Random disconnects, cannot buy last house without game crashing, strict NAT type even with all ports for it open), but overall it still was playable. 15 Minutes into buying this "game" I have crashed everytime I have opened the game. It either crashed joining a friends game or on start up. Also, it gets an infinite loading loop that made me have to Task Manager the process. I disabled my anti-virus, opened all necessary ports, restarted Ubisoft and Steam, reinstalled the game to a different hard drive, and still nothing. Ubisoft can sit there and say "Oh its on your end", but until they fix the problems that literally almost everyone in the community is expierencing, you can consider this my last purchase of any Ubisoft games. Come on Ubisoft you are better then this. This game should just be called "Steam Refund Simulator" based on all the reviews and forum post I have seen from people. The game does work for some people, so it is worth a shot, but just know it still has plenty of glitches in game my friends have seen and them trying to join each other is spotty. Ubisoft, I would love to work with you in repairing this, but based on the forum posts and reviews I have seen on this game, it is a lost cause trying to get you to patch anything.

I don't know if its the connection or the game that isn't going well.

So I look on the internet to fix it, it works. Okay, then it has super LOW RES and the max is 120x250 or something. I spend a little bit and fix that. However, I reset it and NOW IT ONLY STAYS ON MY SUPER TINY SCREEN I ATTACHED! and more issues that would take too long to list... *Sigh*I am now requesting a refund. I was lucky to request one fast enough. Even better, you can not buy it in the first place! I think you should do that...

Every match I tried to get into, it either crashed or just kicked me out of it. Gotta say Ubisoft, you guys really outplayed yourselves.
Graybuck	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Graybuck/	As many other people have expressed, there are many problems with the game not working. Me and my friends tried playing this game, and it wasn't able to work for any of them. Even if I was just reviewing the game from what I was able to experience, the cursor was extremely laggy and I always hate it when the game has no graphics settings besides resolution. I much prefer games to not lag and look like♥♥♥♥♥♥than look good and lag like♥♥♥♥♥♥ On top of all things, it forced me to make an account for me to play this one game of UNO that doesn't even work on my computer.TL;DR Doesn't work, games's slow

RainbowCurry	Not Recommended	7.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chocobobabyboy/	I LOVE UNO! Losing friends is amazing, and UNO is the #1 way to do it. But this game...it has problems.1) You REQUIRE Uplay to play it, which you have to register for in and of itself. This is a 5 minute process before you can actually get to playing, which is fine after you've already done it--but it's another program all together, taking up more space on your HD, independent of UNO itself.2) It's BUGGY! Me and my group played about 5 games and decided to quit because 3 of those ended up crashing. It does this thing where you see another player's turn begins, but instead of counting down as if they're not taking their turn, it just pauses and doesn't do anything. Instead, if you do anything, turns out you're the one that's bugged out, and it'll either disconnect you claiming the Network Connection failed, or this one issue will cause all players to force quit the whole game because no one is doing anything.3) Network connection issues that are seemingly random. I would humor this enough to actually be my own network connection, but at a hardwired 200+Mbps I play MMORPGs, host/join others on other more hardware-intensive games, and this same thing doesn't occur.These three things are something that, if I'd known, I definitely wouldn't have purchased this--but I AM glad I got it on sale, it doesn't make me feel as bad. So if you really wanna play some Uno, go for it when it's on sale, but if you're looking to get in hours of uninterrupted gameplay you'll be sourly dissapointed.

Chukkzy	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chukkzy/	I do enjoy this game, 9,99 € are fine by me for a game of this size, it is a fair price and the game generally works well in matchmaking and otherwise. There are a few hickups with crashes, so far it only happened for me when exiting the game, which is nothing that concerns me too much. In regards of the general UPlay concern, it is not as bad as people make it to be. Once it is installed and updated it works well for me and you do not have to run it every time, it starts up by itself with games that require it. If you like Uno and you like playing online with random people or friends then do not let a DRM system keep you from it.

There's none.-Not even supported by Ubisoft at this point.-Ruleset of the games is bad.As much as i love this game to death, this one is complete trash. I know this has more gamemodes than usual, but, some of them are bad, thankfully you can choose the ones you like. However, Ubisoft couldn't make an appropiate version of this game for PC, it's the worse experience you would get out of 10 bucks. There's so many problems with it that Ubisoft doesnt even care anymore. My advice? Don't buy this game, not even on sale, or for your friends, you'll be doing a terrible mistake to giving away a thing that doesn't even work at all. But if you only want it to play it offline with bots (which their AI is ♥♥♥♥ing horrible too, better AI has been seen these days) then go for it. But don't get high hopes on it.Instead buy Tabletop Simulator, has UNO in it, and it WORKS. And has a bunch more of games.Thanks Ubisoft for making a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Always appreciated <3

MrMii	Not Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMiios/	The idea of playing Uno with others online is a neat idea, espeically with themed cards and special rules like 7-0. However, the need of another game client (Uplay in this case) for a Steam game is a bit absurd, Ubisoft or not. In the few minutes that it was working with a friend of mine, we had a blast.When we tried to add another friend, at least one of us couldn't see someone else in the lobby, despite all three being connected. The reason for that is the method of connectivity. Uno uses P2P (Peer 2 Peer, or directly connecting to the host's machine), which causes issues if either the host has a bad connection or a player connecting to them is far away. It causes a lot of latency, which caused one of us to time out every match. I don't care if it's a computer version of a classic card game. Dedicated servers are the best way to go, which Ubisoft apparently can't afford. This fact makes the amount of lag in Creativerse seem perfectly acceptable.Then there's the the gameplay when it actually works. The only things I truly see wrong when it's functioning are the sometimes insane lag spikes for either yourself or other players (likely caused by P2P, and just to clarify, I have Spectrum), the fact that no matter how many players you have (aside from four), an AI always fills a spot to make sure there are four. Sometimes I want to just play against friends. Oh, and say one of your friends disconnects either manually or from a timeout, they can't reconnect unless the lobby is public. The host can't even add them back. Really, how silly is that? If the game was managed through Steam and not Uplay, I'm certain that inviting friends would be both possible while in a match and while making the lobby.If you think none of this will be a problem for you and your friends, then by all means, spend $9.99 on it. I refunded it since the amount of connectivity issues outweighed the amount of fun there was to be had. I love a game of Uno, but I cannot recommend this. The ratio of issues to fun times are 15:1. That's not good.https://play.unofreak.com/ is a better choice to be honest.

goofy star warz(DcG$)♂	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/goofystarwarz/	Check your NAT type before buying this game by using the Windows 10 Xbox app or some other game to make sure your NAT type is Open. If your NAT type is not open DO NOT buy this game if you want to play online it will not work out, you'll crash a lot (For me every match) and you won't be able to host a match because of your NAT so you won't be able to play with friends that also have strict NAT. I'm not sure how it runs with Open NAT type but I would imagine it'd run better than Strict, but if you have Strict NAT you should only buy this for local gaming, maybe just download Uno with friends, it's free (kind of) and sadly has better chat options...If you really want it, you should wait for a sale then buy it. If you have problems request a refund, that's what I did.Ubisoft, You have so much money and you charge $10 for this game and it has DLC. Why does it use peer to peer and not dedicated servers, I would understand the price and DLC if this game had dedicated server and worked properly. You had one job...
Adleisio	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adleisio/	I would not recommend this game. I thought it was going to be a fun experience and it wasn't because the game runs like crap with my specific set up. I went back and forth with tech support to figure out why, did a repair installation of my OS and even removed some other drivers only to find out that a built in graphics chip set is clearly not enough to run what I tohught would be such a simple game, and there are no options to lower the graphics quality to help built in chip set run better for those that would like to play with their friends.Simply put, this game runs worse than Portal 2 which too me seems like a much more involved game as it requires physics and should be much more demanding on the machine running it.Very disappointed in Ubisoft.

theOtherGuy	Not Recommended	0.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128205011/	Its not at all like regular UNO, they took a good game and permanently unbalanced the mechanics. Now match that where meant to be 15-20 minutes can take up to 30min - 1hr with all the flip around rules, not to mention the draw till you can play rule. I play maybe one match with friends that seem like it was never going to end and decided that this game was not for me. If you enjoy the unbalanced mind numbing game-play of constantly switching hands than this is the game for you.

丹凵丅工与丅工匚	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/destroyandpwn/	I bought this game because UNO is one of the best card games ever made. I have many memories where I absolutely dumpstered my friends and family back to the stone age because I am the best UNO player this world has ever seen. I bought this game because I wanted to prove myself against the world, not just my friends and family who don't even want to play because they know I will continue dumpstering them.To my horror, this game is by far the worst possible adapation of the card game. First of all, it is made by Ubisoft which forces on people the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ system known as Uplay. You basically have to make an account with Ubisoft before you can even play the game because this game's match making relies on that, not steam. This means that my very unique name doesn't show up and Ubisoft also censors names with their gay Uplay system so I couldn't name myself ♥♥♥♥UBISOFT because those absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥tained ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s would not allow me to tell it how it is.Anyway, after I wasted a century of my lifetime creating a Uplay account, I was in absolute horror at seeing how the morons at Ubisoft don't understand how to make a proper match making system. I always thought the people at Valve had sub zero IQs because of Dota 2's absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ constant patches and even worse match making system but clearly the people at Ubisoft just had to go above and beyond at making something worse.My first game, some guy went afk so the two other people playing dced because he had to finish his turn before they could do anything. I waited another 5 minutes and I also dced. I was furious that such behaviour was completely acceptable. This game takes forever to find you just one person let alone three in total so more often than you should you have to start the game with just you and two other people because you won't get a fourth person and someone in the lobby will dc. If you try to enter an existing lobby, you will be put into a game that already ended thus wasting your time.The fact is, this game is a scam and you should not buy it. I will be asking Valve for a refund because this is truly unnacceptable. Never in the history of the world has there ever been a bigger scam. Nigerian princes, "click here for a FREE iPad", "you were just approved for a $6,000 government grant", and "gain 4 inches in 4 weeks" are all scams that pale in comparison.

Brieya	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/brieyasilverweb/	YOU NEED TO HAVE WIFI!!! If you do not, you cannot use this came fully, properly. I went through 2 hrs wait with the tech site for the creators of this game, and they confirmed it. Even with following the steps, we could not get it to play so I could play online or with my friends. It was a waste of time and what should have been a fun night. After five hours, I'm never buying a game from Ubisoft again. I doubt Steam will refund it to me, but what a waste of time, a severe headache, and just pure frustration. Ubisoft refuses to work with grounded systems, they want WIFI only. Fine, I can live without them. A pack of UNO cards is cheaper and easier to use.

Atomicneko3000	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077308946/	Pretty good with friends, a few graphical issues but nothing major.
djmixman	Not Recommended	89.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/djmixman/	To start, the game crashes almost every time you try to close it, sometimes the card selction mech gets "stuck" on a card and selects the wrong card, network issues, and much much more!Playing network is a total crap shoot... There is no documentation about network ports at all. The only thing found is a vague list of random ports used for UPlay. Playing network is a total crap shoot. If you are lucky enough to be able to host without a “strict nat” then you in luck. Otherwise you will spend more time trying to connect to a game then playing.  UPNP does not seem to work correctly. Every other program I have that uses UPNP works flawlessly. However UNO opens a port …sometimes… and even when it does it still does not allow you to host a game.  Eventually after clicking host 20 times it will let you host a game, however if you were to back out and try to rehost, guess what? Strict NAT! When trying to join a game, it will most of the time tell you there is a network problem, sit there try to connect, or puts you in a game deck that you didn’t want to play. When a connection problem happens while trying to join a game OR host a game it will kick you out into the main menu leaving you to drill all the way back into the online menu, only to be caught in an endless loop becuase the horriable network design. Fix your network issues Ubisoft… judging by the search results, this isn’t the only game that has network problems!Overall, this game is pretty much a waste of money. Sucks! I’ve been waiting for this for quite some time and I really wanted to enjoy this game with some family and friends, but instead it just pisses you off trying to play it. In the off chance you are lucky enough to play with your friends, it is a fun game but the problems will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off more than you can enjoy it. Sigh… Oh well…
Jouhaiichi_Gou	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jouhaiichi_Gou/	I bought this game after watching Achievement Hunter's Uno The Movie. My 2 cents on this game:Yes, you do have to register to uplay but it's not a big deal for me because after linking steam to it, there is no requirement to login again after the first initial registration.The online experience: I always host my own game because I want the 7-0 rule. People do come in and out but I've had excellent games where players stuck it out until the full 500 points. It would be great if they allow people to filter the lobbies they want to enter so that people can get into the type of games they want to play.Great graphics, smooth animation, super addicting. But then again i have the capacity to enjoy a game with 3 AIs so take my words with a grain of salt.PSA: Don'f start a 500 point online game without going to the bathroom first.8/10. 10/10 if they do the online filtering or if I can get some friends on board.

Lancer Galant	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LancerGalant/	Miraculously, so far I haven't encountered any game-breaking issues. The only time the game crashed was when I closed it. THAT BEING SAID, your mileage may vary. If you do find any game-breaking issues, remember that you can get a refund.The only big turn-off is how difficult it can be to find players/sessions. One solution is to start an online game with AI bots with the "Unlock Lobby" option on. That way, as the game progresses, real players can replace the bots.Also, if you can, play this game with a controller. The game's not well optimized for mouse/keyboard.I'm recommending this game based on my own experience, but once again, remember that you can get a refund if you can't play this game.
Synthwave	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106098694/	`its a good ol classic uno game but the online is really bad when someone connects it takes about 10 mins for them to join which is annoying. also you cannot beat the ai they always draw the exact card they need
Taninaz12	Recommended	28.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087978964/	UNO :)
PixelTaku	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pixeltaku/	It's UNO. What more do you expect? It has some additional features that make it much better than the physical card game such as an infinite deck and jumping in. The additional DLC is unwelcome though it just ruins friendships quicker. Also I have a super beefy computer but the game runs pretty poorly. For some reason I can't host a room because of "NAT" and I have no idea of how to fix it. But overall, it is a decent game you can have a lot of fun with if you have friends. But seriously, screw those Rabbids
VINI	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/viNmeister/	O jogo tem alguns problemas de matchmaking, muito poucos players online, e as vezes meu jogo simplesmente para de funcionar. os baralhos/regras alternativas são bem divertidas, principalmente o Jump-In.Recomendo apenas se tiver dinheiro sobrando e não tenha nada para gastar, mas se comprar, não vai se arrepender!Se seu jogo fechar quando for procurar salas de MP, tente mudar para modo janela, mas mesmo assim é meio questão de sorte o jogo fechar ou não!7.5/10

Tiger_Napper	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198287854701/	This game that in the real game I meen the card game. If you play UNO online you know how to play the card game.
Vinnie Thicc	Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Varnex/	Why everyone should own UNO:This classic card game has been around for quite a while.And now with the video game version, which has aboslutelyno errors and has never ever crashed, especially when gettinginto an online game, requires aboslutly no physical movement atall when playing. Because playing the original card game was waytoo much effort. And people could easily get tired by moving theirhands.This game is amazing and I will be spending the rest of my life (Not alone) playing UNO. (Without bots).
Mac	Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bigmaclover98/	I played this game for a total of 5 minutes, left it. A week later, I come back, and my keyboard isn't responding. Apparently it detects another controller and it won't let me move, won't let me quit out of the game, just is stuck on the menu unresponsive. If anyone can help me fix that, I would be very thankful. Otherwise, I can't recommend this game.___________________________________________________________________Edit: 6 months later, a new PC and an itching to lose friendships, I decided to come back to this port. Works now, not really sure what the hell happened that caused me to thumbs down the game. It's pretty good. Worth $10, I don't know, but it's still a good game nonetheless. I recommend going on those steam key websites and getting a steam key for cheaper, if you can find one cheaper.

WackoDaSniper™	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WackoDaSniper/	It finally went on sale!!! Now is the time to pick up a classic game for $4.99. I bought this back in January and returned it a week later as I was having a few issues and I didn't feel good about the $10 price tag. I noticed it on sale today during the Ubisoft sale and decided to pick it back up. I haven't had any issues with crashing or disconnects so far (seems fixed) and the game runs smoothly. I really enjoy it and it reminds me of UNO on Xbox 360 way back when. It's not 100% as good as the 360 version but it's still fun UNO and you can't not appreciate that. My only gripe is the game doesn't support high resolutions and the playerbase is incredibly small. Also, the Rabbids deck is free which is a bonus.

FIRESIGHTS	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198314431597/	This game is the best Uno game when it works. Love how I can customize the rules. I have experianced crashes on multiplayer for a while but now it works fine. For people with crashes, try using disk cleanup and restarting. Also after a crash try to relaunching the game and it may work (This is what I do).

Katherine Elena Salvatore	Recommended	35.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198140039176/	This by far one of the best games I have played as it takes a classic card game digitally brings it to life with new rules. I have watched many other people play it before buying it myself. The only problem is that now it says that it can't connect for the online gaming ( which is the actaul fun part of playing the digital version), so that is very disapointing.  PLEASE CAN THE ISSUE BE FIXED SOON.I would give this game a 9/10

Faxeh	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StormyOcra/	Believe the reviews that warn you about this buggy game. The game installer demands admin privileges to run, why? But the most fun was (for me) the game randomly decided to install in traditional Chinese instead of English. Why Uno, WHY? Start by finding the screen of 5 cards. Chose the Yellow Middle card with the gear on it. The top menu option is language. Toggle that until you find your language.

Carnby7	Recommended	2.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010765933/	Mine ran beautifully. The old reviews need redone because the game runs perfect on my PC and on Windows 10.The game runs silky smooth and actually is quite fun and funny at times when you really be a massive pain in everyones rear.Didn't try Mulitplayer yet but I imagine it's also fine, however the connection could be rather buggy and glitchy. Otherwise I highly recommend people buy and play this for casual playing and for friends.
Lancer Galant	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LancerGalant/	Miraculously, so far I haven't encountered any game-breaking issues. The only time the game crashed was when I closed it. THAT BEING SAID, your mileage may vary. If you do find any game-breaking issues, remember that you can get a refund.The only big turn-off is how difficult it can be to find players/sessions. One solution is to start an online game with AI bots with the "Unlock Lobby" option on. That way, as the game progresses, real players can replace the bots.Also, if you can, play this game with a controller. The game's not well optimized for mouse/keyboard.I'm recommending this game based on my own experience, but once again, remember that you can get a refund if you can't play this game.
Deadpool	Not Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OGCOLA/	Okay so i ended up buying me and 2 other of my friends a copy of this game. I thought "Oh man, uno for 4 bucks, that sounds like a good time" but it wasn't. Uno just simply does not work well. There were many instances of one of us not being able to progress due to the fact that a turn did not register on their end or the game simply crashed. We had put more than 2 hours each of us (Me: 2 hours and 36 minutes, Friend A: 9 hours due to leaving his game on overnight, Friend B: 4 hours), i was only able to get a refund for my copy after requesting 3 times, rendering the other two copies wasted. Seriously, do not waste your money on this. You will realize after hitting the two hour mark what i mean from these issues and will most likely not be able to get a refund.

Loli	Not Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Greywater1818/	This is such a bad itteration of UNO. The deck is not a normal deck and the number of cards is not finite. There is no algorithm that simulates the probability of drawing certain colors that one would have using a real deck fo cards. i.e you wil often draw 6 or 7 of the same color in a row when draw to match is on. There are many other flaws such as the points system in 2v2 play. i.e in 2v2 matches it is the first pair to 500 points, however, the points awarded at the end of each individual game are random. i.e onbe pair may recieve 30 points for a win while the other will recieve 200. The calling UNO system is terrible as it should be an automatic draw twop cards if the person dowsnt call UNO. Rather they make one of the opponents click a tiony exlamation mark thgat comes up, if they fail to do so the person who did not call UNO recieves no penalty.

Now you may be wondering "What does this have to do with uno?"... Well thing is, there is a player-made module of uno in the game, which is unrelated to the main part of the game but IS in the game.Now, the game is free, so is the uno module, so anyone with an account can play it (guest accounts can't however, so you will need to create an atelier801 account for this) and its way more worth it than this one!Pros:- Multiple rooms you can easily go around to- You can play with more than 3 other people. Mostly at most 8 chairs or 10 chairs depending on the game rotation- THEY HAVE A LOT OF HOUSE RULES, not kidding (includes sudden death card, jump-in, no challenge, team match [which is more exciting than 2v2], ... they have more than 40 house rules i think)- You need to pay only $0- You can also unlock the house rules by playing, and then making your own module rooms to play with your friends and implementing those unlocked rules in (Unlock the Rule card, you will be able to unlock other rules with the rule cards c; )- You can chat to other people (flame them, congratulate them, whatever)- You can unlock different chairs- Seriously do I need to say moreCons:- Sometimes the uno module game crashes... which can be easily averted by going to other uno rooms (its that easy)- Because it's a game in a game, you have to deal with the parts of the main game (ie. you being a mouse, dealing with the main game, etc)- Oh you might need to figure out how to get around in the game, so it might take some time to know what to do- The uno module does not have different skins (But it does have special cards depending on the house rules)- It can take some time to get the house rules you wantY'ALL COME TO TRANSFORMICE, A PLAYER-MADE UNO MODULE IS LITERALLY BETTER THAN THIS AND ITS FREE.Steps:0. Download Transformice from Steam ($0)1. Make an ateiler801 account (If you're ever bored with unoing, you can go look at other player-made module games like prophunt or deathmatch or hotpotato or literally many things... or atelier801's other games)2.

JockTankCmdr	Not Recommended	0.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JockTankCmdr/	By far the most awful card game of any kind on steam or any platform for that matter.....20min to try and get in a game in more than one ocassion and after 7 games i have managed to finish a game just once due to constant crashes, As for the price, dont get me started...The game is just not worth that type of money FULL-STOP.Right now i would not grab this game even if it was free to play.Deleting from my Pc forever as am pretty sure this will be the last time i even look at this Store Page.P.s I do know what UNO is and have many many Hrs on it when i played it on the Xbox and this port or what-ever is an embarresment to this very enjoyable card game !!!!!

Katherine Elena Salvatore	Recommended	35.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198140039176/	This by far one of the best games I have played as it takes a classic card game digitally brings it to life with new rules. I have watched many other people play it before buying it myself. The only problem is that now it says that it can't connect for the online gaming ( which is the actaul fun part of playing the digital version), so that is very disapointing.

Viking	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032578415/	UNO is a old school game but still really finny to play
Bowler4Ever	Not Recommended	47.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Bowler4Ever/	Ubisoft, in all its glory, ruins yet another gaming experience by not allowing people to connect to other games, especially when streaming, thus ruining the experience for those streaming and trying to play. This needs to stop, and I recommend not buying until Ubisoft fixes their POS user interface called uPlay...more like uDontGetToPlay.
FIRESIGHTS	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198314431597/	This game is the best Uno game when it works. Love how I can customize the rules.

Also after a crash try to relaunching the game and it may work (This is what I do).

Pixode	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fxcusofficial/	Actual garbage game. Unless you want to only play against bots, do not buy this. The game consistently crashes before even getting into a multiplayer game. And if you do manage to start a game with your buddies, you can be sure that someone's game will crash the moment you put a card down.

Deadpool	Not Recommended	2.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OGCOLA/	Okay so i ended up buying me and 2 other of my friends a copy of this game. I thought "Oh man, uno for 4 bucks, that sounds like a good time" but it wasn't. Uno just simply does not work well. There were many instances of one of us not being able to progress due to the fact that a turn did not register on their end or the game simply crashed. We had put more than 2 hours each of us (Me: 2 hours and 36 minutes, Friend A: 9 hours due to leaving his game on overnight, Friend B: 4 hours), i was only able to get a refund for my copy after requesting 3 times, rendering the other two copies wasted. Seriously, do not waste your money on this. You will realize after hitting the two hour mark what i mean from these issues and will most likely not be able to get a refund.

I went through 2 hrs wait with the tech site for the creators of this game, and they confirmed it. Even with following the steps, we could not get it to play so I could play online or with my friends. It was a waste of time and what should have been a fun night. After five hours, I'm never buying a game from Ubisoft again. I doubt Steam will refund it to me, but what a waste of time, a severe headache, and just pure frustration. Ubisoft refuses to work with grounded systems, they want WIFI only. Fine, I can live without them. A pack of UNO cards is cheaper and easier to use.

Hillbilly FPS	Recommended	2.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069004853/	I know UNO as a video game might sound silly, especially on PC. But in a good silly way, like a "fooling around with friends kinda way". Me and a couple friends bought this game on sale during Christmas, at first it was as a joke but shortly after we got into it we decided we were sticking with this game for good. It's fun, fair price (recommend getting it on sale, then again I recommened that for every game but you know what I mean), and simple. And of course just like any other family card/board game you get that "Aww man!" throughout the game when something almost, but not just quite goes your way.As of now I can't tell you anything negative about this game, I think it's all perfect. It's an awesome game to play with friends, it's relaxing, it runs well, I haven't seen any bugs so far either. Also a fun fact is that it's by Ubisoft, or it's on Ubisoft (sorry I don't know how to say it exactly, like is it made by Ubisoft or is it using the source engine Ubisoft or what? I don't how to say it correctly lol sorry). If your unaware Ubisoft holds the Assassian's Creed franchise, so you'll share your Ubisoft account with UNO as well!Actually come to think of it, there is a thing or two you should know about this game. Wouldn't say it's completely negative but it depends on how you look at it. There isn't many things to push towards glory with this game, meaning there isn't a whole lot to master. If you know UNO, you know a majority of this game takes luck rather than skill, so it's not like you can get better at it or anything. I don't rememmber there be achievments either.  You can level up in this game and achieve a good looking profile with the more you win, but that's about it.Nevertheless, there's UNO. A chill back game to play with the family, but nothing to gain popularity or a lot of talent in. And remmember, no bugs and it runs real well! I'm giving this game a thumbs up.

WackoDaSniper™	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WackoDaSniper/	It finally went on sale!!! Now is the time to pick up a classic game for $4.99. I bought this back in January and returned it a week later as I was having a few issues and I didn't feel good about the $10 price tag. I noticed it on sale today during the Ubisoft sale and decided to pick it back up. I haven't had any issues with crashing or disconnects so far (seems fixed) and the game runs smoothly. I really enjoy it and it reminds me of UNO on Xbox 360 way back when. It's not 100% as good as the 360 version but it's still fun UNO and you can't not appreciate that. My only gripe is the game doesn't support high resolutions and the playerbase is incredibly small. Also, the Rabbids deck is free which is a bonus.

If you want to play just by yourself and no other person than this will be perfect for you because you may never have a chance to play this game with friends.

Faxeh	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/StormyOcra/	Believe the reviews that warn you about this buggy game. The game installer demands admin privileges to run, why? But the most fun was (for me) the game randomly decided to install in traditional Chinese instead of English. Why Uno, WHY? Start by finding the screen of 5 cards. Chose the Yellow Middle card with the gear on it. The top menu option is language. Toggle that until you find your language.

The only downside to the game that I can think of is that you need to create a UPlay account, which itself is not much of a bother. Once you've set that up, you're free to enjoy it. The game has different game modes that keep it fresh and replayable. Saying that, the game isn't perfect, but no game is.

The only bad thing I have to say about this game is that it does crash from time to time and the online functionality can kick some people out of games unexpectedly.

However, I will say that if you are looking to get this game that it is strongly recommened you manage to find someone play with you.

★ShinyLugiaYT★	Recommended	25.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/toybonnieisback/	Really good game, but like any other game, has a lot of flaws.Pros:+Good to relieve anger on (lel)+Support for controllers+You can play the game slowly or take it as some sort of a B rush+95 cards in 1 hand is 100% possibleCons:-Made by ubisoft. Their servers are like 2 lines that never meet (good servers and ubisoft servers)-The game forces you to get an UPlay account (i had one but lost it)-You lose friends (and your eyesight) easily-+4 cards, what else-The DLC's are so overpriced-The game forces you to run♥♥♥♥♥quality if on a low end device (yes i am also looking at you watch_d0gs)Gameplay score: 85%Graphics score: 100% :ok_hand:Game strategy score: 55%Game server score: 25%Accessibility score: 55%Developer score: 90%Bot AI score: 85%DLC Accessibilty score: 65% since you need 2€ to buy a single oneDLC Content score: 80% cuz y notOverall game score: 60%Would I recommend this to a friend?  yes  Not at all.Why I chose Yes: Because i cant complain for 1 day of my life invested in this game lel
Lil01	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lil01/	This game crashes a few times when I try to get to a lobby with random people but sometimes it works. Still, it is relaxing if you play it with your friends in the evening even though there are a lot of people who get aggressive if you put a +4 card, hehe.

Pixode	Not Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fxcusofficial/	Actual garbage game. Unless you want to only play against bots, do not buy this. The game consistently crashes before even getting into a multiplayer game. And if you do manage to start a game with your buddies, you can be sure that someone's game will crash the moment you put a card down.
Faze Conspiracy	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JoinTeamOverlord/	I would suggest this, it is very fun, even by your self. I don't think you'll play it a whole lot by your self, but it can still be fun. With friends it is amazing. I got this game for very cheap, I don't remember but, it was cheap.

skunktronix	Recommended	32.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197996733674/	I've decided to update my review, as Ubisoft has updated their game. Online multiplayer is much more stable than it was, with only occasional bugs causing connection issues or general glitches. The different themed decks are definitely worth getting also, for extra variety in gameplay and special cards. I highly recommend this game.
Taira	Not Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tairabiteru/	A warning to those who host servers on their network:This game requires ports 80 and 443 (as well as others) to be forwarded to your computer on your firewall. I've got no problem doing that as I'm a network administrator by trade. However, if like me, you have a server operating on those ports, this will of course be impossible as the server already occupies those ports. Since I'm unwilling to shut down my web server just to play a game, my only option becomes putting my computer into the DMZ or putting it in front of the firewall. Since I'm unwilling to cope with the lunacy of putting my computer in danger just to play a game of UNO, this leaves me with no options for online play.The argument can be made that most people don't host servers, and this therefore would not apply to them. As a result, perhaps it's my fault for assuming that this game would simply work. After all, it's not as though I've seen any other multiplayer games that require the port for HTTPS to be forwarded even though literally any other port would make this possible. Hell, you could have just given the option for the port to be configured instead.But my response is that I'd point out: I have literally not played any other game with such ridiculous port forwarding requirements. Regardless of whether or not I have a complex setup, I've never played another multiplayer game that's given me such a massive amount of trouble. I'd therefore make the argument, that perhaps the game should have been designed differently, since many other games seem to work just fine without forwarding the same ports used by web servers across the world.

I highly enjoyed it and would reccommend playing, however the very next day it keeps crashing with "Uno.exe has stopped working" everytime I try to load it. Sometimes it crashes upon accepting an invite, other times I get in game and almost get to play a card and it crashes then. Not a clue whats going on, revalidated files and uninstalled/reinstalled and the issue remains the same.If you can get it to work, I say it's worth it.

Tomoya	Recommended	4.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MadTight/	I only recommend this game because I NEED MORE PEOPLE PLAYING ONLINE! Excuse me for the caps, but holy balls, if you have friends that bought this game and have all four of you play together, it's going to one hell of a fun ride. Other than that, playing solo and finding a match with a full party is literally nonexistent. Online is just bot world, but if you're just playing Uno just to get better or have fun, then why not. Oh, before I end this review, buying the game on sale is the better thing to do, so put this game in your wishlist and remember what I said. Hope to see you online :)

Kappa	Not Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheToppestKappa/	UNO is a really fun card game, but in this video games current state, I would not recommend picking this game up. The performance is very poorly optimized, and even on some high end computers, you will still be lagging while playing it. The gameplay itself is a pretty stuttery, and sometimes a little confusing to play with. What saves this game, however, is it's accessibility. At it's current price of 3.99, it drives a pretty good bargain, around the price of the actual physical copy. It allows you to play with friends that you might not be able to make a game night with, and can easily do it over the power of the internet. The cons of this game outway the pros in my opinion. If this game ever gets more optimized, I would recommend this game, but until then it's a no for me.
Blazave	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198315893255/	This game is probably the perfect game to lose your friends on. All you need is a +4 and or a really big chain.

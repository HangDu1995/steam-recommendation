Ray	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rayzedd/	5 hours played, still fun. Needs more content asap tho, otherwise its gonna get boring. Maybe some other challenges also, instead of only the shark.
Fade Willow	Recommended	24.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053184399/	So I played this game last year and was impressed by the playability but the game was short lived. When I saw it had a major update and watched some early releases I was hooked again, literally. The game looks beautiful very nice improvement on graphics even down to the smallest little detail.The fact that we now have weather mechanics added and the stormy seas is an extra bonus I was not expecting but gives the game that extra special feel. Love the idea of the islands and the other random rafts that randomly appear.Overall the update has brought many, many new items including a research table to enable us to upgrade to better quality items and new items also.The Game is still nicely paced always something to be doing and making you think on your toes.Well done guys fantastic jobWatch my *First Look* impressions Let’s Play here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doI4loHIGQFade 
Lucy	Not Recommended	2.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MaddoxBlaze/	To be honest, this game is actually a good concept. But once you have a stove, a water purifier, a bed and other needs this entire game just becomes a cycle of fishing, cooking food, purifying water and repeat.
milky0ne	Recommended	9.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/milky0ne/	yeah
Legion	Recommended	19.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EvilCupmunk/	Raft is the type of game where there is no greater purpose, other than surviving. Collect, Build, Eat, drink, stab an annoying shark in the face a few times, repeat. The game runs pretty smooth even with my aging EVGA Gerforce GTX 760 which was a great GPU... in June of 2013. There is a little bit of a learning curve to figure out what does what but that curve is not very steep at all. Which is good since the game doesnt really provide you much information in what to do and how to do it over than some basic item descriptions. Those of us who have played the free version for some time though, there are no real surprises. The islands are cool and there has only been 1 time so far that I was unable to reach the top of one. There are no defined baths up so lots of sprinting and jumping off other rocks. Having a double tall staircase at the edge of the raft helps a lot as well to function as a sort of boarding platform. Small tip to new players though.... Dont build a wall on the endge of the raft. Leave a path so when the shark decides to munch at your raft, you can actually get to it. Overall, considering how active the devs have been with this game through its development this far, I think its a safe bet to say this game will leave early access as a finished product, unless like some other titles that stay as early access seemingly forever until the game dies off...
SkyblowDK	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SkyblowDK/	Amazing game, worth every penny. Looking forward to more content in the future.
Talon184	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/talon184/	I think this would be an ok game, but it bugs out too much. I played for a total of 55 minutes and twice during that time everything in the game (except my character and the ocean) suddenly disappeared. My raft was gone, the islands nearby, all the stuff floating in the water...everything...all gone. So I was left treading water in the ocean with all my progress wiped and no way to start over since everything was gone.If this happened twice in under an hour, forcing me to restart both times, I don't see how I can progress in the game.Plus, t he shark is unbelievably annoying.Submitted refund request.

Zealot780	Recommended	13.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/VimHomelessIsWhereLifeIsLG/	The beautiful distant views of an island as the sun sets is so relax- wait where did that shark go?
Sturban	Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002992757/	I can't recommend this game since there is no pause button...just kidding.Almost 2 hours behind and for me it's fun. You gather debris from sea and make use of it. One shark is attacking your raft and breaks one part at the time, unless you got spear and hit it until it runs, then it breaks that one part in two attacks. I'm too early in progress to tell anything more.20 euros/dollars seems to be much for some people and I get that. Similar games are cheaper. But if you are into crafting, gathering and researching, you'll get your moneys worth.And there's easy difficulty, you don't loose your inventory on respawn. I'd rather play hard but then it takes longer to get into the game. So first learn the basics and then harder difficulty. Or do whatever you like, that's up to you.
Storm Princess	Recommended	24.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998628988/	That's a coop survival game done right. Really good. While still in early access (aka limited amount of content), we just spent our day having fun in "normal" mode (there were 4 of us). Didn't really run into any bug, no lag, game is stable and feels balanced. Already one of the best survival/base building games around. Will probably rank amongst top 3 of the genre once its finished.
TrifALo	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TrifALo/	In my opinion Raft is a great game, lots of fun and many things to explore.I recommend this game to try out with your friends or just online, I can see it getting repetitive. The game have a few bugs here and there but for a Early Access Game its a good start to a potientially fun full game.Raft has good aspects as a survivor adventure game, you start on your 2x2 'raft' and your hook to get those materials that you will need to survive. You constantly move forward on an endless ocean where you scavenge materials thats just floating around the surface, there are many islands to explore and items to craft.The crafting in this game is very good and simple, just get the materials and craft what you need what is not so hard to do. One of the most fun fetures is fishing, you can literally spend all day just fishing and not doing anything else.. besides staying alive from hunger and thirst.... and your friend (shark) who is trying to kinda kill you but besides that, its not that hard to survive.One of the biggest game's feture is building:You can build your raft as big as you want, get materials and design your raft as you like, be creative.I definitely recommend you to give this game a try, you will not be dissapointed with what you get -  graphics are fantastic, performance is great has no lags nor fps drops, controls are very simple and just amazing in general.

MsFizzy	Recommended	11.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MsFizzy/	get this game, it's a little bit too expenseive for whats in the game at the moment but that doesnt pull me away from how fun it isit could use a little bit more content in it like more threats or more rewarding stuff near the end but i love what it has in it right nowi would recommend it.
✪ Colby™	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/burritopleb/	This game is so good! Its really fun even after 6 hours and beating the game.

❥ Blondie!	Recommended	57.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085530106/	I ain't the biggest fan of Waterworld, but hot damn this game is fun to play alone or with friends. There isn't a lot of sitting around doing nothing unless you are about to starve to death and you are staring at your food to cook, even then the shark decide's it's a perfect time to attack! Love this game, can't wait to see it evolve!
Rex	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Hooxtan/	An enjoyable chill-out game with little to no bugs for an Early Access game.
Nari	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dunkatron/	This charming water based survival game manages to solve the one thing that i've always sort of struggled with in survival games. Which is the desire to explore but no reason to do so.  The raft itself is your home, you expand it, you build upon it. You defend it from the sharks, you use it to travel the seas. Seeing an abandoned raft or an island i n the distance is a real treat. And with multiplayer, a great joy of everyone working together to get more resources and survive.So far this game has been the best 20 dollars i've spent all year. A solid gameplay loop and an enigmatic " end " reveal that makes you wonder just how much further will you sail on your raft.   I won't spoil anything but, man, the cryptic messages have me hoping for so many things. Even if this fails to get any more meaningful updates, its definitely a fun 10 hour+ survival romp that is made all the more enjoyable with friends.

Chasey	Recommended	69.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chaseycat/	So far, so good. For an EA title, it looks great and I'm having a blast.Different difficulties are great for learning, especially when you bring a whole pack of friends who are just as dumb as you are, (Turn off friendly fire. Or don't; it's still hilarious) and then turning it up when you've really got a feel for how not to murder each other, drown, starve, or try to pet the sharks while actually working together to create a really cool - or really stupid - sea-worthy craft. Bonus points if you can hoard enough resources and build your raft large enough to crash the game on more than one of you.And if I'm feeling chill, I'll go for creative mode by myself to build an entire floating shanty town or a veritable pirate galleon to roam the seas with and pretend I have Sea of Thieves but with about 90% more things to do.I recommend this game. The price is a little steep - I'd say $10 or maybe $15 is closer to what it should be asking for - but I paid the full $20 in the hopes that I will see much more added to the game. The devs have already been working quite hard from when this was a free demo a year ago so I'm feeling hopeful! Keep it up!
Build	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kirbyus/	Very chill game reminicent of craft-equse games. Very fun with friends.Though it needs some work, for instance, Planks have so many uses you'd run out quickly whereas plastic is the complete opposite. In the game i played, we were scrounging up for planks and had a T1 container filled of plastic.Also, can there be a better way to climb islands? building a raft up high would eat up resources mentioned earlier.In all, I would recommend this game, but it still very much needs some work.

OldAssGeek	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/old-ass-geek/	For an early access title this is really refreshing. I'm hoping for some really cool new stuff in upcomming patches, as well as a character customization. Bigger Islands, bigger rafts, more loot, more to build and create.It's definately more fun with friends but also a great game if you want to get away from all other unoriginal shooters and battle royal clones. Buy this, relax, build your raft and have fun.On the negative side though, the game requires a lot, specially at night. I must run this in low graphics to even reach 60 fps where I can play games with lots more going on at high quality.Keep up the good work.

Floof	Recommended	16.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/floofqueen/	Alright so ten hours later into this I manage to get to what is sorta an ending but kinda not?So I figure why not make a lil review on it thus far (I know it is bound to get some updates as it isn't even fully released) But lemme just say this is one of the very few open world survival games I adore. It has so much potential!Pros:Easy to learnGreat artstyleHas some replayability (to an extent I feel until they add more things)Great soundtrackActually mildly relaxing after a hard day And well funSome cons tho:Has some bugs (obviously expected since its newly released, nothing game breaking just mildly annoying)Multiplayer is beyond buggy, with 2 players its fine but any more than that the game kinda just stops responding almost entirely (Which I bet they will end up fixing in upcoming patches!)Feels somewhat anti-climatic course you have the storms and the shark attacks but like I feel its missing something else like maybe add temperature based hardships and other challenges. Feels kinda easy to me but who knows like I said where they will take it!I don't wanna be too harsh on it as of course it is in the earliest stages but even soIt was awesome to play and I cannot wait to see what else they will do with this game!And yeah imma keep playing thisIts fun <3

Ghost	Recommended	20.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110153538/	Ok so first off this game is completely worth the 20$ I spent on it.I think the price is perfectly fine and worth every penny. Everything that is already in the game and everything that could possibly come later is worth it.In the beginning you are stuck on a flotaing 2x2 raft with a hook. Your main objective at the start is to throw your hook out into the water and try to grab every bit of floating debri's that you can in order to expand your raft, make survival necessities such as a grill, water purifier, fishing rod, storage containers, etc. You will every so often have to defend your raft from a constant menace that is a great white shark. He will try to take a chunk out of your boat approximately every 5 minutes. If you are quick enough to damage him he will let go and go back into the ocean while you repair what he tried to chomp on. However if you are not quick enough he will destroy a piece of your raft. He is killable but will respawn very quickly so make use of the time.If you can manage to keep a good balance between your water/food you will last long enough to start finding islands. These islands are packed with trees, flowers, food such as watermelons, mango's, coconuts. As well as sometimes you will find a site where a raft has crashed up on the island during a high storm and it will contain a crate with various building materials.You will also start seeing other "rafts" floating on the water which will have a crate on them. Once you step foot on the raft though it will start to sink. So grab the crate quickly and return to your raft with your spoils.I love the almost constant battle you have to do in order to continue to provide food/water/building materials to keep expanding your raft, adding various things onto it and keeping yourself alive.Even once you have figured out all the best ways to do certain things it is still fun to do them.Your best friends in the beginning will be a fishing rod, sail, and collectors.If you are playing solo you will notice in the beginning that the shark is a bit OP. However once you figure him out a bit you can come up with ways to get around him to get everything that's underwater without much hassle.Game runs smoothly even though right now it seems to be locked at 60 fps.Currently there is no FOV slider so your are stuck with very small FOV. Hopefully this will be changed soon as I like to play at 110 for every game I can.I would recommend this game to anyone that wants to have a good time trying to survive at sea. The game is even better if you have friends to play wit with. So many moments of laughter and torment will await you should you decide to get this game.( At this time I don't think you can cannabalize your friends....although I havn't tried....Guess what I'll be having for dinner if I ever run out of shark meat?) 
Akinaxis	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/akinaxis309/	When I first tried this game, it was low quality, very basic survival game, Multiplayer wasnt even a thing without external files, and when you coudl actually get it to work, you coldnt see the other player.Seeing it now on steam, with such improvements, reaaaaallly good improvements.Didnt even think it twice, I bough it, and I have no regrets, really Amazing game, entertaining and fun. specially with friends.So far I can only suggest for more challenges, bigger islands (some are inaccesible by jumping you cant get to the top of the islands) and 1 shark per player would be more frightening or even more... depending of difficulty or achievement that the players have reached in the match.More uses for items such as feathers, you cant a lot but dont use them that much.100% Would recommend.
le turt	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/salt69/	very fun with friends
scary skeleton man	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lemonaide_/	I love this game, I cant stop playing. A relaxing experience, even on hard by yourself or with friends.
Dtrain	Recommended	32.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dtrain8899/	Absolutely love the game! Looking forward to any updates in the future. Some things I would like to see is maybe some sort of rudder because when your raft collides with islands and other rafts, it tends to rotate and it makes the collectors sometimes useless unless you replace them. Also, uping the amount of time it takes to respawn a shark, I will kill one, swim for supplies just to instantly get attacked again, maybe 5 to 10 minutes would be pretty nice. Other than those two things...9/10 stars.

Leonardo the Savior	Recommended	27.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RojoHero/	Alright, I saw a youtuber play it and was like "eh I'm bored" So that's how I got here. I started with 4 foundation blocks and a plastic hook. 2 days later I now have a 4 story floating mansion with dozens of collection nets, near infinite food, half a dozen shark heads mounted on my wall, and all manner of luxuries around me and its still not done yet, I barely even touched the paint feature. I tell you this because I want to put out there that I've done everything in this game. The game itself is pretty straight forward. You start with a tiny 4 block raft and a plastic hook to fish things out of the water with, good luck! First 2-3 hours is gathering everything you can find as you float helplessly in the water, all to make sure you have food and fresh water to drink. After you begin to establish yourself a bit more, the game moves into the next phase, progression and expansion. The progression is similar to Subnautica, once you've got means to feed yourself and defend yourself from the sea monster (annoying shark I've since dubbed "Meat Bag" and I kill him for his delicious meat rather than farming these days, I ran outta wall space in my palace for trophy heads so I just have a dedicated chest for them now) you will need to upgrade your equipment and gain access to more complex items. This is done through the Research Table. You'll have to spend a resource to "research" it, once you've researched enough items you'll gain access to advanced tools, navigational equipment, and general quality of life improvements. As your raft gets larger and more elaborate you will become much more self sufficient and need only a few specific resources now and again. There's always something to be doing, especially early on. Every so often Meat Bag is going to do something to inconvenience you. Either he'll try to eat a block out of your raft (destroying anything it's sitting on in the process, or he'll try to eat you while your getting metal deposits on islands... In either case stabbing him in the face is a good short term solution. If your solution to the food problem is to farm potatoes and beets you'll be introduced to a new friend: Drumsticks. Drumsticks is going to eat your crops if you don't scare her away or stab her in the face... Either one works. Managing these "friends" on top of building, farming, gathering resources, cooking food, navigating, smelting, exploring islands and so on... There's definitely plenty of things calling for your attention.Now the progression has a... slower moment. A bigger grind than usual, and that is the Smelter. The Smelter will gate your progress to MUCH better equipment and will be very high on the priority list, similar to the Cyclops Submarine in Subnautica, this thing is a pain to make but you thankfully only ever need to build 1. Once you've got your awesome gear (and loads of dead shark heads from when Meatbag decided to "visit" while you were collecting Metal/Copper/Scrap/Sand/Clay/Seaweed), better water purification and a sweet grill, the game then turns to a new direction, Story. Now early on the game is going to literally drown you in schematics for 2 specific items, as of now there is no other items treated like this and that is because these items are for the story and have nothing to do with survival. As of now the story is unfinished but your endgame goal is to find the "Utopia"I'd say the difficulty is low. I played on Normal and I've yet to die once. Resoures are generous and health regenerates over time. The game is a lot of fun in multiplayer but does NOT rely on multiplayer for the experience. You can solo play just fine and not miss out on anything. The game is as much about building as it is survival, your going to put in some hours to make a really dope raft. I'd give the game a 7/10. This is a casual game that gives you the challenge of surviving in the ocean while also granting the freedom to build whatever and however you'd like. There's a story, but you have to dig for it. There's no tutorial telling you how to survive 1 night you gotta figure it out yourself. Its a good time, only really limited by the fact that once your like me with your floating palace and near infinite resources, there's not a whole lot to do. Getting to this point takes a good while however so don't let that scare you too much.

So yes I would very much do recommend this game!!!!

Watto	Recommended	20.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/watto-/	Playing this version from the version I played on Itch.io you can see the amount of work put in so far, currently 7 hours in and while we've unlocked all the blueprints it doesn't even feel like we've scratched the surface, much base building to be done!I could see this being boring in singleplayer, definitely grab some friends to play with.Music leaves much to be desired personally for me 
Jon AKA Tins	Recommended	30.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152308100/	This is an amazing game! You need to plan things out early to be in best health, but you can also just wing it and make it happen. I almost died from starvation and hunger at the beginning but i quickly made a fishing pole a cup, and water purifier  and patched my self up before i died. Too much fun!
huntreilly25.noc	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/huntreilly25/	Really addicting and fun game so far!  Excited to see what gets added as development progresses
Big_Red_Block	Recommended	27.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198215816660/	Can not express enough love for this game. Definately recomend watching for updates as it has a lot of potential. I was fearful that it would be to close to subnautica but i was happily proven wrong.The games has an interesting mechanic that other survival games lack. All harvestable resources are there prime for the taking from the very start instead of requiring an upgraded tool. This comes at a risk though. A risk that is very much worthwhile if it pays off or devastating if it doesnt.This game is for you if you love:-the partial survival grind that games such as Ark, Seven Days and the Forest provides.-resource management.-smooth building mechanics.-co-opThe game does have some bugs (dont be holding an anchor if a shark breaks it or your stuck).100% recomend this game, completed within the first 4 days of release with 2 friends
shawbag11	Recommended	20.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shawbag11/	Loved my time with this but got to say its a bit short atm its good for about 10/20 hours that's not really a bad thing and hopefully there will be more stuff added but for the moment just know it wont last you too long id say its worth the 15 quid though :D also id say if u can play this with other people i dont think i would have enjoyed it as much if i played it alone and its actually quite cool to see your raft go from 4 tiles to a massive village.

Nari	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dunkatron/	This charming water based survival game manages to solve the one thing that i've always sort of struggled with in survival games. Which is the desire to explore but no reason to do so.  The raft itself is your home, you expand it, you build upon it. You defend it from the sharks, you use it to travel the seas. Seeing an abandoned raft or an island i n the distance is a real treat. And with multiplayer, a great joy of everyone working together to get more resources and survive.So far this game has been the best 20 dollars i've spent all year. A solid gameplay loop and an enigmatic " end " reveal that makes you wonder just how much further will you sail on your raft.   I won't spoil anything but, man, the cryptic messages have me hoping for so many things. Even if this fails to get any more meaningful updates, its definitely a fun 10 hour+ survival romp that is made all the more enjoyable with friends.
Akinaxis	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/akinaxis309/	When I first tried this game, it was low quality, very basic survival game, Multiplayer wasnt even a thing without external files, and when you coudl actually get it to work, you coldnt see the other player.Seeing it now on steam, with such improvements, reaaaaallly good improvements.Didnt even think it twice, I bough it, and I have no regrets, really Amazing game, entertaining and fun. specially with friends.So far I can only suggest for more challenges, bigger islands (some are inaccesible by jumping you cant get to the top of the islands) and 1 shark per player would be more frightening or even more... depending of difficulty or achievement that the players have reached in the match.More uses for items such as feathers, you cant a lot but dont use them that much.100% Would recommend.
Nykez	Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jordanlol633/	Fun game. Pretty much did everything in the game around 5hrs. So lacking content, but fun.Looking forward to the game progress will fire it back up in a couple months.
ninjamatthews	Recommended	22.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198369049463/	this game is awesome if you like survival games this one gets the best of them better than minecraft better than terraria one of the most fun and addictive games ive ever played its where your on a raft and you have a hook and must hook stuff in and beware of the shark . i love this game
👻 LuvPolaR 🎃	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LuvPolaR/	Slightly buggy at the moment, with a few bugs, such as building in creative mode with friends and not very much to do after beating the game XD, but will keep playing if more things get added over time. Great graphics, runs pretty smooth, idea of this game is great, hard at first when you start out not knowing what to do, but after its pretty fun to mess around with friends, personally would recommend but I'd say wait until Raft has more in game stuff where you can do more, but then again if you dont care and you just like builidng and surviving then go ahead get it. Most annoying thing is prob the shark, esp when it starts biting your platform smh...
Behltane	Recommended	29.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/behltane/	Despite being Early Access, Raft is worth the price of admission.  The game works very nicely, with the controls feeling precise and the gathering with a hook or swimming feeling satisfying.  Basically you are floating on a collection of planks in the beginning, and with your hook-on-a-rope you begin to drag debris towards yourself in an effort to build your Raft.  As with most survival games, there is constant pressure to be working towards food and water - Raft doesn't complicate this too much, however with multiple people on one raft it's pretty important to have someone almost constantly cooking and purifying for the group on Normal setting.Raft is very pretty, and I found myself very engaged in it for the first few hours.  At this point I think i've seen most of what there is to see in my time played, but it was definitely worth the 20 bucks for a couple solid days of floating along the ocean currents.  Despite the location, I am not at all salty from having picked up Raft and look forward to seeing more.
TheMustardCat	Recommended	13.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198220271841/	Pretty good game. At the beginning its hard but then after the first night ir two, I got to understand the basic by my self (and the help of steam forms) and I am really enjoying this game I have not played multiplayer.

Todd Howard	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NONOVA24/	This Shark really has NOTHING else to do but terrorize me? Really?
Peanits_BHVR	Recommended	7.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GnomeChompski/	This is a surprisingly good and unique survival game. If I had to compare it to anything, I would compare it to The Forest, but in the ocean with sharks instead of cannibals. It's not your typical rock-smashing survival game either, collecting resources works completely differently. Raft building is solid and works well, you have a good amount of freedom to place stuff wherever you want. I haven't run into any bugs yet, not even a minor one. Nothing's confusing, you can figure out everything just by playing the game and using common sense. It always feels like you're making progress and getting better gear or adding on to your raft, yet I never found myself overloaded with resources.Only gripe is that there's not a whole lot here yet, about six hours in I had already researched everything, but that'll be easily fixed with some content updates. I'm still having fun just expanding and improving my raft and I've got a long way to go before I'd consider it done.
KeineGnade	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theguythatplays/	I wanna put an ehhh. It's a great game and early game can be super tense. It is also a really fun co-op and multiplayer game with some issues. You cannot build a seperate raft that isn't connect to yours and progression turns into making it from a raft to a floating city with tons of nets on two sides in a line to catch the most stuff and then just build. The shark doesn't even become a problem until you have to mine somewhat for metals and seaweed and whatnot. Then endgame is doing the same thing until you feel like you want to stop. The inherent problem is after you build a nice big raft and have all the tools and fancy things there is no point to play except achievements and it gets boring going for 365 days survived. Good game overall just gets boring in the end game.
HGamer	Recommended	11.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HannGamer/	Early Access Review
SlickLikeNinja	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SlickLikeNinja/	Game is still Early Access at the time of this writing.Graphics: 3/5Characters/Story: 0/5Environment: 3/5Combat: 3/5Replayability: 4/5While those numbers may seem low, don't be fooled. This game has virtually no story as far as I've played at this time, and your one of two playable character types is a blank slate for you. You're floating on the ocean, on your tiny raft, picking up resources as they float by you, trying to expand your floating home and continue surviving while fending off a vicious shark who wants to break your raft apart and consume you. You can deter the shark, you can even kill it, but another will eventually take its place. And perhaps worse than the shark, you will fight hunger and weather and dehydration constantly.The graphics are good, fairly simple but pretty. Hard to make a mind-blowing graphic experience when you're just drifting on an open ocean though. The environment is good too. You are able to board and grab unique supplies from derelict rafts nearby, and you can park your raft near small islands and dive deep for other rare resources to expand your home and functional capabilities. Screenshots do a better job at showing you just how much creativity and expansion you can have in your raft, from a floating fortress to a beautiful drifting ranch house capable of sustaining your livelihood indefinitely. It's still early access right now, and I highly anticipate great things from this developer. I did have problems with sharks being able to attack raft sections that were enclosed, with the shark clipping right through the base of my raft to try to break a center piece. There was also no real guidance about diving or raiding dead rafts, nor much information on researching my materials to develop newer recipes, and I wish the shark were not so frequently aggressive especially so early on, but these were all manageable issues, even possibly ones that don't necessarily need a fix. I have not yet played the multiplayer, but I'm sure I'll get to it. Overall this is a very fun, relaxing time-waster, and I hope they add more to it to increase its playability, maybe go the Minecraft route and add like hidden temples or other enemies. I recommend it if you're just burned out on AAA titles or just want something that isn't so involved. The more they add, the better it gets.
Gyunda	Recommended	48.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054100226/	I bought the game at full price because I wanted to play with a friend. While I don't think it is worth 20 Euro at the moment , I really like this game and am excited to see what new content will come.Multiplayer runs smoothly and is ultra easy to set up - a big plus because for my friend it's the first time gaming ever.As a child I liked the film "Waterworld" and hoped for a game like this. Raft - for me - fulfills that desire.I like the cartoonish, happy graphics, the creativity you can put into building your raft.The game still needs a lot of content and I hope the islands will be improved. And I think at least the hunger declines a bit fast.  
Kevin James	Recommended	22.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KevinJamesMyBoy/	This game is amazing. The gameplay is exciting and sometimes pretty challenging. I would definitely suggest playing with a friend, though, as it makes the game a far more enjoyable expirience. I've put a lot of hours into this game and know I will play more in the near future. I definitely reccomend it.
SolidSniffles	Recommended	52.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154336451/	CONS: 1.) Frames drop tremendously(5-10 FPS) due to the amount debris spawned into the world(That may be because I capture the debris very fast and it causes it to spawn more of it in a short period of time).2.) Frames Drop when you build  multiple fire sources.3.) Game is short.4.) Not much to explore.5.) Repetitive islands, ghost ships, and not enough content(yet).6.) Lack of dangerous wild life in the game. Just 1 shark follows you and once killed it respawns. PROS:1.) Fun co-op experience.2.) You get to build your own ship.3.) Exploring is fun at first.4.) Mysterious.5.) Devs update the game6.) Simple7.) Prety colors.Other thoughts:It would be fun if we fought other things like pirates  or least more tasks to do in the game. Over all the game is simple and fun.
Alula but he's sick :(	Recommended	28.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/physicalembodiment/	damn i need to play more of this game... anyways it's basically minecraft but with 95% more water, and coming from a person who got bored of minecraft this is fun
Iansomnia	Recommended	19.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Iansomnia/	I do like this game a lot and I'd love to have some people to play with to enhance the experience I'm having with it so far. The only gripe I have is during segments where you are drifting through the ocean and there is no materials floating anywhere for up to about 30 minutes. It puts a halt on everything. I know it's supposed to incentivise you saving materials beforehand but it becomes tedious after a while as you'll find yourself using most materials in  the mean time. Despite this flaw, I do enjoy the gamea and I'm curious as to what the developers have for updates.

Reeconator	Recommended	17.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Youknowwhatgoes/	What I liked:I loved the atmosphere. The controls were easy, the mechanics logical, and the game is just the right amount of difficulty and ease.What I didn't like:The game does not explain anything, so you have to find how to do things.I'm going to update this more, but as of right now (update 1.03) the game is amazing.
skep	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skeptical_lol/	I sometimes find survivial games very interesting. I liked playing with my friends and we had a blast playing it. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and new people if they find this interesting.
bappo	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vapegodxx/	Awesome game, great survival feel to it, its a challenge to keep your water and food topped off when you start, and you constantly need to be on your toes if the shark comes in.

ixmelon	Recommended	19.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ixmelon/	Probably one of the most simple, but most enjoyable games I've played in years.

Nina	Recommended	17.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012275026/	Multi-player reviewThe good:  Totally worth the money!First and formost this game is definitely worth the 20 bucks. I got my money's worth the first night I played it.It's unique for a survival game and it's pretty darn fun and easy to loose track of time. I couldn't put this game down after I got it, and I was feeling sick that night.. I love the graphics, very cute!Building pieces really fit the game and feel.The music in this game is just epic, and it's a very relaxed setting when sharks arent trying to eat you.The bad:CANT REPAIR ITEMS: ie the tools! WHAAAT!Sometimes the game is not that intutive:  for example: I actually had to look up how to build a second story to my raft, which I normally don't like doing as it can be sort of spoilery.  The building piece for the second story is called wooden floor however it doesnt look like a square piece more triangular actually which is why I never bothered to use it. I feel like it should resemble the foundation piece so its easier to spot what you are looking for.The hook I found took some time to understand how to use properly. It feels like that arcade game where you try to win a toy and you almost always loose the item you are trying to win when you first start playing around with it.  It's a frustrating tool to begin with imo and to be honest I actually started swimming out to items I wanted and risking my life because I thought it was less of a headache.  With time though I started figuring it out a little better but I felt that it's durability wasnt worth the effort so I went back to risking my life and swimming out to get what I needed. That was before I discovered the collection net.  Do yourself a favor and just start pumping these out as fast as you can as it will really make your life easier. I would however reccomend putting a foundation in front of it so your shark doesnt eat it right away.You have to eat and drink a lot.. probably too much imo.  I think they could tone that down a bit or add more types of food progression. More progression in general would actually be pretty great, but this game is still being worked on so totally understandable. One of the things I was most excited to try in my first game was to build a ramp from the bottom of my raft to make it easier to board once I go smimming but I found there was no building material that would allow me to do that.  Nor is there one to enter from the bottom of your raft.  So in the future I would really like to see more building options on your raft.Last but not least here is a list of items/mechanics that I personally would love to see eventually:Motors Decorative propsCrafting npc's that increase your building potential and durability on itemsPiratesWhirlpools, and giant waves things you need to try to avoid with your raft.island towns with npc buyer/sellerMore fish life - some glow fish would be really wonderful at night and would make underwater exploration a little easier too.More types of weapons and things to catch materials with.One thing I would change if I could:The first hook is really annoying.  Read above to find out why.  I would actually rework this a bit or even go back to the drawing board with this one.
Bootius_Maximus	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bootiusmaximus/	Bringing world issues to the forefront of modern gaming, Raft is paving the way for future generations of environmentally responsible gamers. At the heart of this cutting-edge game, is the marriage between survival and marine conservation. The strong will survive by how efficiently they are able to accumulate waste debris from the ocean. A couple hours into the game, and you will rejoice at the sight of garbage. This is life on the ocean, where everyone’s trash is your treasure.
Mullins	Recommended	13.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977126002/	I had no idea being stranded on a raft for 10hours would be this fun! I'm looking forward to more content!
Mcdovin	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mcdovin/	As of version 1.03 and with 11.3 hours played on July 12, 2018I do recommend this game if you have a partner to play with.In solo, it's not all that exciting discovering things on your own.I feel quite a few will compare this to Subnautica and for good reason.But I've had a lot of fun with my girlfriend just exploring and building our raft.We haven't quite reached end-game yet, but there's still creative mode to try out and we played it on Easy.Seriously, F*** that shark.I also hear there's  EELS?Anyway, if you're on the fence, try it out and refund if you don't enjoy it.8/10
Pipa	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pipaistaken/	I mean, Its a game with a great concept. But I feel like they didnt develop the whole story, there could be such a better ''ending''. I feel like the game isnt worth its full price.You ran out of things to do fairly quickly, but its a fun game.
Izzkabizz	Recommended	53.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/izzkabizz/	Really love playing this game, can't wait to see some more content.The water quality is so great that I needed to increase my FOV, drop the graphics and play in windowed mode due to motion sickness.Highly recommend this game if you like a casual survival sim.
Persian King	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057857671/	This game is unique in its own way. It is unlike a game I have ever played; I really dig the "survival" feeling and it peakes your instincts to become creative in making items from scratch, literally! Survival games have been very popular in the past 2-3 years, especially Battle Royale games, which are overrated and can be annoying. This game is not only calming, but it has its addictive sides, whether that is creating or fighting sharks in the mysterious waters.

viper_2029	Recommended	46.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041234990/	 At the time of writing this review, I had already 'completed' the game  solo  (Easy) @ 16 hrs on record   Getting into this game is oddly similar to going to the gym for the first time: - You purchase that gym membership with high hopes/expectations of getting that sweet bod:'Buying Raft, hoping it to be as good as you'd expect and enjoyable for years to come'- You enter the gym and have a go at all the equipment, learning how to use them properly, what things to do/not do etc. with no prior knowledge:'Launching the game, learning the basic controls etc.'- After a session or two, you notice there's very little-to-no difference in muscle gain and completely shatters your initial expectations of getting that sweet bod:  "WTF, THIS IS IT?! JUST FISHING FOR OCEAN GARBAGE FOR 20 MINS?!" - You start questioning whether you'd  actually  be motivated to go again and again in the future, whilst considering of cancelling the membership:----> I legit considered about requesting a Steam Refund after my first 20 mins.- But in the end, you give it some time and patience, going more often and learning tips & tricks along the way, and finally achieving that sweet bod you always wanted. Conclusion 8.5/10 would get virtually seasick again.It's a momentum-based game.Very boring & repetitive at the start. But once you get the hang of it, you won't realize the sun's up if you start playing at midnight.

Sam	Recommended	5.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YourMumIsObese/	Raft is a good game, you can get quite a few hours game play out of it, with the updates that are coming out for it i'd definitely say its worth the price. I mean, it's obviously more fun to play with friends because you can build together instead of solo but its personal preference really. I pretty much got it from day 1 and if you'd of asked me in that first week if i would recommend i'd honestly say no but its improved soooo much i love it.
A Fucking Alligator?	Recommended	20.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198363565493/	This is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life. It took me and a friend 15 hours to "complete" (We still have like 18 achievements we will try to aquire.) For anyone thinking that this game is a 'Play for 2 hours and then you're done' type of game, it definetly isn't. There is always something to do and the game is sometimes super challengeing/ time consuming but almost all of the time its super fun and theres always something to do. I highly reccomend this game to anyone looking to buy it!
Johnne25	Recommended	25.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969807779/	I played the game for a little while think that it was slow paced and that it would not be fun.  Next thing I know 4.5 hours have passed buy and I ended up enjoying myself.Graphics are fantastic, waves are great looking and everything else is crisp and bright.  I am hoping they continue to add content to the game as there could be just a little bit more to do.  The shark is a bit a pain, but I think you can deal with easy enough.  I do wish that when you managed to kill it the span before it reappears would be larger.As much fun as it was in single player, its 10x more fun with a friend.  Its worth the money for sure if you know someone else who owns it.Note to DEV:  Make it so you can rotate your raft.  I hit an island and it caused it to turn and I no longer like the way it moved through the water (sideways).  Please add this feature even if its in the form of a temporary rudder or something.Some really big storms would also be cool, lightning and winds.
GET OUTTA MY SPACE	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thefuckamidoinghere/	Good idea, good openworld.But you find that there nothing to do really quick.I can't say that it becomes really boring. But you literally don't want to do anything after 5-7 hrs.If the craft system will be improved - adding new features and etc - then it will be a way better.Also some equipment's HP runs down too fast, IMHO.Well, 5-7/10.
crazy anonymous guy	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198293645554/	The game is fun, the price is a bit high but after more updates come out, i would say it is worth it, the start is a bit repetitive but after some time, you get to the heart and soul of the game, building a huge raft that defies logic, then after you get the radio, it gets to the plot part were it is unfinished and need work, you can skip the repetitive part with multiplayer or creative mode, and the dev are taking suggestions, also, you can download mods at https://www.raftmodding.com/

Lamb Sauce	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198339555116/	A very impressive game! I played this for hours on end. When I had no idea what I was doing. This game is great, no doubt, but there is not really a good end game. It needs a bigger bang. I won't spoil the end or anything, but once you finish, it just doesn't feel too "Wow I finally did it!" or "Whoa that's crazy. Game changer!" Sure you kinda feel like after a long time you reached the end and it's pretty cool, but it isn't difficult to get to the end. At all. took me only a couple hours. If they just add a lot of new content, like giant sea monsters! Leviathans! or massive islands that you can loot for a while and maybe even stay in. In the end, it just needs a nicer finish, and a lot more content to explore and use. Maybe wait a little bit before you buy this game, wait until it gets more content added.
Hans	Recommended	39.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091123754/	Pros: Great game. Looks and sounds great. Hours of fun and nerve racking moments.Cons: Price at $20 and no real end game yet.Played 40hrs. Got to current end content. Meh. Nothing really to do now.Still, recommended! (and waiting) 
Afteg	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Afteg/	The main source of satisfaction in this game is knowing that you are cleaning up all the garbage in the ocean.On a serious note though this game has a lot of potential and has a few hours of entertainment until it gets repetitive.
Mleviah	Recommended	50.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010780880/	This game is very fun, great ideas and wonderfull atmosphere.  Only downside is that the game is still in progres so the actual content is a bit small (Still enough for maybe 20 hours of fun if you take things slow)I will look forward for development and I believe this game can be big hit one day.

Fefneir	Recommended	143.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fefneir/	Rather fun game, the developers are still adding content so starting new games and going again has not lost its charm. Multiplayer so you can have multiple games for playing with different groups. The down side being after several runs you'll pretty much hit the end game pretty quick. I'm hoping in time with the devs still working and updating the game like they are that there will be much more content and things to look forward to as time goes on.
Elysian(Kriffix)	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kriffix/	Great game! I expect more though! Slow at first, but once you start building your raft, gets more fun and you feel achieved! Really hope they add some huge islands and just more content in general. Wonder what ideas they have... There are so many things you can do. Will hope for the best. Maybe more sharks? a school of Orcas? Glaciers? So much you can do.
Slowslam	Recommended	9.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987759966/	Pretty good game, seen no bugs so far, more endgame content and stuff will be added as it is an Early access game (i hope and suppose).Cant wait for coming back for a longer playtrought, had 9 hours on medium Difficulty, would love to spend tripple in it.GJ so far DEVs :-)
Well Met	Recommended	15.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/eXCELSiOR89/	I almost never publish reviews for any games, but this game DOES NOT deserve its current review situation. In this battle-royale-hype era, this kind of games is a super-welcomed breath of a fresh air. It lacks some end game content for sure, but that can and should be forgiven, as an early access game it sets the bar of expectations to a very high point. It has a lot of fun in it especially as an online co-op game (this genre is slowly dying and we need more games like this to prevent online co-op from becoming non-existent).7/10 considering the money/hours ratio and even in its current state, would easily get an 8 with a few additions.

Matt	Recommended	26.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094684731/	Raft is a fun, chilled out (almost therapeutic at times) survival game that puts a fairly unique spin on the survival genre, in that the resources have to come to you - not the other way around. Raft is still in early access, and there's not really a lot of content yet, but it is definitely moving in the right direction. The game is particularly good when played with friends, and you have to co-ordinate main roles on the raft in order to maximise your raft's potential (1 person farming, 1 building, 1 gathering materials with the hook, for example).The key point to note though, is that Raft is really as much fun as you make it. If all you want to do is see the 'endgame content' (which is currently almost non-existent) and build a purely functional raft in order to do it, you can complete Raft in an afternoon and probably won't have much fun doing it. What makes and keeps Raft fun though is your imagination and drive to build a luxury, multi-story, floating palace. I cant wait to see what content is added in future.

jig27	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jig27/	It's good but it doesn't have much stuff right now
punk_tanuki	Recommended	24.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198376728406/	A little tricky at first trying to find where everything is located. Very similar to Don't Starve, but with the extra bonus of evil shark that has it out for you like a bad STD.
omen.king	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/omenking/	I can see this being really fun with friends. The fun is figuring things out until you spends hours frustrated and then look up what to do. Then once you've optimized food and water production its grind to get electronics and by that there doesn't feel like much to do so you quit the game. Fun for 10-15 hours.
Jawz	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JawzXD/	Very good game, but very boring at the same time. The first 6-7 hours are very fun, after that, it's pretty boring. Me and my friend made everything basically fully automated, we didn't have to hook anything, or fish beause we had so much food from islands, and from growing. If you are looking for a dozens of hours of gametime, maybe you could find it if you do all the achievements. The reason I stopped playing was becuase there is no incentive to keep playing after you already crafted everything. After a certain amount of sharks killed, islands explored, and metal ore smelted, it starts to become very repetitive. If you are looking for 100 hours of fun, you're going to have to make a few worlds.
Pearl	Recommended	3.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198076078256/	I really like this game but I keep on having bad headaches and feeling the need to puke whenever I play this, especially if there is a storm. I wish there is an option to turn off the super realistic movements because I really want to play this game.My brother tried to play this game and he didn't have any complains.I recommend this game if you don't have motion sickness or not prone to sea sickness.
apogee.dwell	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050684884/	I think the devs have a great start with this! The building is fun and polished, and the concept is excellent. It's early access, so there's not much content yet, but I got about ten hours out of it before I ran out of things to do.I hope they add the option to turn the shark off in a future update, though... :(
Ogny8791	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ogny/	In it's state as it is right now I recommend it for the sole purpose because I love the concept and because it has potential. Though to as simple as possible describe the cons.. it needs More.
Onmyoji	Recommended	10.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198436134432/	This is one of the best games I have played this year. It is fun, exciting, creative, and relaxing. The graphics and setup of this game is terrific; however, there is one thing that I am not quite satisfied about. My friend and I spent 10 hours on this game and we finished the plot of this game, and so it is really hard to keep playing this game enthusiastically when you knot the end of the story. Redbeet plsplspls update more challenging plots in this game.
Neotic	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wyfrit/	Great game, still in early development but it got great potential. I would recommend buying this before it gets a lot more expensive :)
Dragonlady0525	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066789393/	I love this game so much I got it for my child (15 yrs old) and we play it together. We have a lot of fun playing! We've already played enough to get to the abandoned ship. Now we're going to go bigger and make a kick butt boat. We love crafting games and this one fits the bill. I bought this game. I also bought the original game on itch.io when it was first out. This one is more fun and rewarding!
Logicbomb	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/logicbomb/	I really enjoyed my time with Raft and I look forward to seeing what all they add to give it more substance.  After about 12-15 hours you kind of get into a a boring grind that is pointless.  Anyone into Survival game will have a good time, I do wish the game was a bit cheaper but if they add more  later game content it would make the price easier to justify.  Here is some game play video if you like to see me playing it.

koemhop22	Recommended	50.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198363259065/	This game is awesome . It is very interesting but there are still a lot of things that can be updated . I think it will be so much more interesting if there was something like Megalodon . it can be spawning like the 50th shark . So it will make the achievment for 50 killed sharks much more interesting and the player has a lot of time to build a big raft so it won't be too strong .

Indigo Omegram	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeepIndigo/	15h, done everything. right now that's £1 an hour, seems reasonable. Potentially longer if you enjoy the base building, which is alright (rust-esque albeit simpler) the game is still EA and needs more content. Has potential, but right now a tad short on content. While I'd reccomend it overall, I'd say give it a few months at least if you're looking at purchasing with the intent of going deep on something.
SirMuffinCat	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033230232/	Really cool to see how your raft can go from a couple of planks of wood to a floating hotel.Plays best with friends in my opinion. We like to name the sharks that circle us.7/10 waiting for more content

BamboozledPupper	Recommended	27.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065067122/	I was a bit sceptical at first, because 20 euros is an awful lot (to me) for an Alpha game. But, we decided to give it a try.Me and my boyfriend were looking for a nice game in which we could survive/craft stuff/etc. We came across this game and decided to give it a try, if it sucked we could still refund it. We were surprised at how fun it was and played it for about 3/4 hours straight. The game itself has this really cozy vibe with nice art style. The lack of bugs surprised me, there is one where you have to jump in the water if you drop your hook on your boat, but other than that no major bugs found yet. The easy mode is not that easy at all if you're a beginner. Especially finding out what to build first is hard. After a while you have a pretty sustainable food/water supply so you can craft other things. I don't know how active the developers are yet, but after playing for some hours you do start to get a bit bored sometime. The game needs some extra content, maybe some extra (accessible) islands as well. So far I really recommend this game, especially fun with a friend.
Fatal Demand	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106644677/	Great with friends, heaps of fun, lots of challenges.would highly reccommend if you like survival games.
[Jele] iRabbie	Recommended	28.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jeledekzaa/	I love this!  because every structure are very cute and useful. I love to design my raft but there are a few activities to do and very fast game ending.
stinka	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hazelsalmon/	When i was going into this game i was looking for a mixture of three games, Sea of thieves, Rust, ARK Survival Evolved, when i bought it, it was not what i expected, but in a pleasant way, its very relaxing, not as intense as games such as Rust etc, crafting is nice, i wish there was more cosmetic options and clothing options along with other things to attack you in the ocean while fishing would be a nice addition.The game has no bugs that i have experienced apart from one, a glitch where i had a chest inventory stuck on my screen, which i simply fixed by saving my world and reloading my save. (out of almost 10 hours of gameplay) But other than that, i have no bad views about this game, the game was ALOT smaller than i anticipated with only being 868mb as of this current patch of August 13th 2018 which i did not expect at all! Great for people who dont have time to install a 40gb game.The FPS On this game is brilliant i have had no drops at ALL on a GTX 1080TI Paired with a I5 5560 And 8GB of DDR4 Ram, constant 120 FPS Or above! (Settings are on Maximum)So i  have close to no issues at all with Raft and am very pleased with the total price when not on sale for 14.99£ Very nice game, if there was more NPCs to interact with that would be great thats pretty much my only issueGame total rating      9.2/10
Cortana finds the third room	Recommended	48.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061879683/	Superb survival game that addresses many of the progression issues that other survivial games ignore. Take heed, this is the only game that has given me rediculously debilitating motion sickness that lasted for days after stopping playing and as such I am no longer prepared to touch it. Enjoyed my time whilst it lasted.
Kuroi Nakane	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkFortressXmod/	Good game for a while, you can find resources by hooking floating thing, craft thing, mining thing.Play multiplayer for the best experienceBut the gameplay is too shortI think the price is a little bit too much for this game 7/10

aetavan	Not Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198239183256/	As some other commenters have said, it's not worth nearly $20 in its current state. It starts off interesting and then becomes repetitive and boring within a few hours. You float, expand your raft, find an abandoned raft, then find a deserted island. Keep floating, find another abandoned raft, and then another island. Do you find two islands in a row? Nope. You always find an abandoned raft and then an island in that order. The game feels like it's well made. Like if somebody cooked you a solid meal and then did not season or salt it at all. You can appreciate that it's not a poorly executed dish, but it still feels incredibly lacking. I understand it's in Early Access. If it was cheaper and had just a little bit more content and variety, I would give it a thumbs up at this point.
Recon420	Not Recommended	94.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Recon420/	This game is lots of fun but it is not worth $20 in its current state, I like the game and it has lots of potential if the developer doesn't abandon it, look forward to changing this review one day

GingaBoySwag	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070094953/	*End game spoilers* (since people are whining about content but havent even seen it all)So alot of people are hating on this $20 game for "not having enough content". I almost thought so too when I got my raft to be 3 stories tall, and explored a ton of islands. Which takes like 15 hrs at least if your alone. People pay $20 for movie tickets that last 2 hrs and are less entertaining then this beautiful, relaxing, survival game. This game is perfect for a nice calm morning when ur trying to relax and has the perfect level of shark stress, scenery both scary and beautifly calm above and below water, and base building that ive seen $60 survival games unable to match. *****-People hating on the game because they run out of things to do are just sad that they beat a great game.***** Plus, half of these haters havent even built a radio relay out of antenas and made it to the oil rig which is actual end game stuff. If you feel like $20 dollars is worth about 20hrs of grade A entertainment you will be happy with this game. And thats if you don't play it again with friends and make a new raft.
Ludsoe	Not Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ludsoe/	Review for version 1.01bRafts a pretty nifty little game, the idea of going along and strapping junk you collected to your floating home as you go is neat. However as of this version the gameplay is rather simplistic and overall unfun honestly. The GoodBuilding up my giant multi story wooden fortress was pretty fun and rather satisfying to see it come together.There was always something productive to be done like fishing, placing rugs, and "exploring" islands you drift into.Playing with friends ease's gameplay and makes it somewhat bearable.The BadThe shark is rather annoying, and will keep attacking your raft every few minutes. You can kill it but it just respawns after 30 or so seconds.Once you make a large enough raft, everything becomes trivial since youll have near infinite trash floating into nets placed along your raft.TLDRThe games overall playable, but lacks any real gameplay meat. For now I reconmend waiting out for a sale to drastically lower the price.
Khamsinvera	Recommended	93.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/khamsinvera/	Raft is a fun, relaxing game in an open world, rather open sea! Think Minecraft - but you're a bobbing speck in a cast ocean. You come across deserted islands, buoys with supplies & you scoop up mats as they float by.I enjoyed my first few hours with Raft tremendously ... and then I tried to 100% run. That's when the game becomes a chore. Hooking 5,000 items and surviving 365 days isn't for anyone who has a normal attention span. I suppose this could be made a little more tolerable by adding in a LOT, I mean A WHOLE LOT of end game content - but I still doubt that anyone would want to go thru the monotony of manually hooking items when your collection nets can do the same thing for you.However, my achievement related rant aside, overall - it's a fun game & well worth your money. GO SHARKS!
✪ em4r99	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/em4r99/	Great game i really recommend it but it'd be nice to see - Pirates (not in easy mode and pretty rare in Normal)- Cannons- berrys- swords (to fight the pirates, also works on sharks, but spear is better on sharks)-  Motor (to the raft, but really hard to get)-  a gamemode where you get to build your own raft in creative (timer) and fight someone else with cannons-  more plants, bushes, seacreatures you can kill with spear like octopus or something

DRIEDdog	Recommended	21.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047862041/	It's really an awesome game! I played 3 days non-stop when I first played it with my friends until midnight. however I noticed some lack of contents since it's still an early access but still shows promising updates in the future since it's just an early access.I wanna comment some ideas and improvent as a fan.1.) More weapons such as Harpoons! to kill shark or cannons with black powder as a craftable resource.2.) more enemies aside from shark, such as bandits with a small boat like us players with 1 or 2 enemy bandits and we can either kill them or negotiate for our life if we think we can't win and give what they ask for like 1 scrap and 4 plastic and so on. Later the bandits can increase in number as the game progress. I mean I really wanna shoot these bows and arrows to an enemy asside from the one in the water and make use of the binocular for some pirates incoming.3.)Since this game is about lootings we can't forget about Treasure maps! I hope there are hidden maps in the loot crates on the island and use that map to find treasure using the satelite.4.) Boss battles please. Of course since there might be some other players who doesn't want to fight so there can be a choice to either sail away or look for the map that shows where the boss is hidden such as the legendary Kraken!!!! or other mythical, epic creatures since it is a boss right?I am really not asking much but wanting for a more awesome game from an awesome game. ThanksPS. I think some people wants this game to be peacful so when making a new game they can either choose to have bandits or not, like survival mode or peacful mode etc.
LaurenTheShort	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/laurentheshort/	Raft is a very fun game and it's best enjoyed with a handful of friends. I would definitely reccomend this to anyone who loves a good survival and building game and likes a little bit of exploration as well. It's not perfect, but for 20$ you still get a good amount of gameplay.However, there are some things I would like to see fixed or added:-The sharks AIThe shark was scary at first but once you let go of your fear and become the aggressor... well food becomes a non issue but you also learn the sharks pattern which is to attack, retreat, repeat.-The dissappearing raft glitchOccasionally youll spawn in the middle of the water with no idea where your raft is. On creative it becomes more of an issue than survival where you can kill yourself and spawn back on your raft.-Lack of building ability on islandsThe only portion of the game you can build on is the raft and no where else. It would be much easier if there was an ability to be able to build ladders and stairs on the islands instead of having to build floating stairs to no where on your raft.-Small IslandsIt would be very amazing to see some larger islands that can be explored and discover maybe some stories about the different islands! Caves and things of that sort while you float on your raft exploring and picking up different legends and treasures, just a thought!-More enemies The puffer fish is/ is going to be a great add to the mix as well as the bird enemy but if there was an occasional boss type enemy after x amount of progress or time played it would really liven up the game ( a cracken or giant squid!)All in all this is a very fun game, it does have a ways to go but is a game worth playing NOW to support the dev team and to see where this game can go. Personally I feel like while it does have some limited content in it's current state, it's still fun and entertaining and sometimes very relaxing with the building and creative mode. I live streamed this game for several hours and felt there was enough content for everyone to enjoy it for a couple consecutive streams.Would I reccommend this game, in short? Yes.
Byteflux	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020970673/	It's a fun little game, but WAY too little content for now. Can only hope there is more. After taking it very slow on Normal difficulty, I was done with everything the game hda to offer after only 15 hours. Will come back in a year to see how this game has evolved :)
Scuss	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045771868/	This is a very fun game but keep in mind it is an early access meaning much more will arrive in the future. Playing with a friend is highly recommended. You can build a raft and customise it as much to your liking, and explore different islands all around the big map. There is in addition an island that explains some lore as to why you ended on a raft in the first place. This game is very good with some minor setbacks that some may find boring but some may seem fun.
wyrix	Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wyrix_/	It's good and fun for a while, however after sometime it gets boring. It's fun for and hour or two and of course this game is Early Access, however it lacks content. I hope it will get better after sometime, however for now i would not buy it. Still a good game, but not much content. I'll still give a 6/10. 
Rabid Elevator Midget	Not Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054080636/	The game is fun and peaceful but right now there is just nothing to do.In five hours or so you can build everything there is to build, probably doable in 2 or 3 if you tried. There just isn't any content right now.There is one enemy in the whole game, the shark. He eats holes in the raft, other than that he's not a threat. His AI is terrible at hitting the player and with a decent spear you can kill him with very little effort. Not that it matters he comes back in about two minutes and he's really just there to annoy you.Way to many items don't do anything. Stone is for arrows (which you don't need) and the starter anchor. After you get the metal anchor stone is useless. Copper is only for electronic stuff once you make the antenna and the radio it's useless too. Glass is for two recipes only. Clay is only for making bricks. Way too many things are  only for one item when the game already has very few crafting recipes to begin with. All you ever really need is plastic, rope, planks, and scrap.I wish there was a "meh" option here. The game is ok, but right now for $15 it's just way too bare bones to justify it's price.
Xas	Recommended	146.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xas_Lim/	Survival at its toughest stage, be it Normal or Hard mode.Hard is only suitable for Playing with Friends or considered Ironman ModePlaying the game alone on Normal can be hectic.Game for the Hardworkers. Agile control and think quick on the sail.Act fast when scavaging or in water.Time is ticking.Wood is never enough.Game gradually gets less tedious once the advanced equipments are in place.Highly playable.Time passes quick while playing.Hope there will be more updates and development on the game. 
DoomedShadow314	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198369120721/	The game has improved so much, multiplayer is amazing, would 100% recommend this game.
ZemunBRE	Recommended	30.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nevenapetar/	Early Access Review
Morgan Grimes	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Smurfj3/	I had played an earlier version of this years ago, it changed a lot since then in a good way. Keeping in mind the game costs 20 bucks I think the game is alright. Not amazing, not bad, just alright. I think 20 bucks is way to much for the current state. There is just not a lot of content just yet and it gets repetitive real quick.The game has lots of potential and I love what the developer(s) did so far but it's just not worth the 20 bucks. I would recommend buying this on a sale. I will set the review to recommended because the game itself is alright and I am certain the developer will add more content and it is still in alpha state after all. However I would like for the developer to go down with the price to maybe about 10 bucks is what I think it's worth the way it is right now. Just increase the price on actual release.
RaveKnave	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RaveKnave/	Game is alot of fun, I am excited to see where it will grow. Only down side is I did everything to be done in the game in 11 hours. Looking forward to what will come next.
Col. Korn	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025025894/	Raft has huge amounts of potential. I played it back when it was exclusively on Itch.io, and I've spent a good amount of time in both normal and creeative modes. Compared with the itch.io version this is a massive upgrade which give me faith in the continued development of this game in EA. Here's my verdict, for all who are interested: TLDR: 6 or 7/10 right now - 9/10 when/if complete. You'll enjoy the pure survival experience, the unique premise of surviving on your raft and the clean aesthetic. Right now, in early access, there's isn't quite enough to completely justify the $20 pricetag, but I fully expect that when this releases fully it will be. Lots to build and keep yourself occupied for a few hours and hopefully much much more to come. Not Long Enough, Gotta Read:The good:Polished graphicsNot many bugs encounteredBuilding up your ship is tha bomb, so few limitations here... You can build a little dingy or a massive galleon (as long as it's mostly square-shaped)Sails make you feel like a pirateGreat foundation to build a survival/crafting game off of, already a good amount to do / craft / seeAlready integrated multiplayer (with friends - you won't encounter random people)It's adequately tough (could less good depending on who you're talking to)You'll contantly be busy, the gameplay loop is satisfying and has purpose (wake up - attack shark, eat food, check nets, check crops, replenish stocks, attack shark, search for stuff, sleep, repeat...)The less good: *note some of these may be rendered irrelevent with EA updates*Game can get stressful quickly on harder difficulties (energy meters deplte quickly and replenish slowly) and can even be a bit annoying on easy... Not the relaxing expereince I want sometimes...There isn't much variety to the islands and "encounters" you have in game (at least not yet)Islands are a bit too tall to get up to easilyDecond floors require foundation (which is good) but it can be frustrating to have your bottom floor filled with support polesI have used the antenna and reciever and it seems WAY more trouble than it's worth In general there needs to be a deeper tech tree (great start already though, you won't feel this for a couple hours)No story yetThe not good:*these are a little longer, my apologies*The shark is your only real adversary, but it never gets stronger, there are never more of them, and the only way you can distract it for a period of time is with some "shark bait" which requires you to fish up specific fish (I never seem to catch those damn small herring) - this dynamic is getting old rather fast. It's a great issue at the start, but by the time you have a massive raft, turning the corner to see a missing square is more annoying than anything else. You could just ignore the shark after a certain point if you collect stuff quickly. Definitely needs something to spice it up (different mobs, laser sharks, the KRAKEN, idk... maybe you even could train the shark after feeding it enough times who knows? Excited to see dev progress here. There is much that isn't made clear to you on how to use certain tech/items - a small "how-to" book like in scrap mechanic would be a great way to visually dispense some knowledge without an annoying tutorial. A good example of this lack of guided direction is the fact that you use "Seaweed" in the smelter to make "Vine Goo" - I discovered this by accident. when walking past my smelter holding seaweed the option popped up, until that point I had been searching the seafloor for vinegoo.The spear breaks after a number of uses that isn't devisible by 4... you'll see why this sucks whn you've hit the shark 3 times only for it to break before you can give it the last hit - then it eats your scarecrow and you angrily craft a new spear. Personal Gripes:Too. much. plastic. Seriously, I don't know what to do with it all, I always end up throwing it back in the water... Is this a commentary on society? Because if so... I get it...Weather doesn't do anything but act as an aesthetic difference right now, would love to see more varied and impactful weather (whirlpools, tidal waves, etc...)Underwater exploration can be so freakin amazing, by far my favorite experience thus far has been finding a wrecked ship deep under an island - would love to see more interesting stuff underwater (sunken pirate ships, atlantis style ruins etc...)Right now it seems that once you start collecting scrap and metal from underwater, the barrels contain less scrap than before.. this is super annoying since I find myself needing scrap so much mid-late gameI really want to use the hook to pull myself towards objects - I noticed that it attaches to hard surfaces but just resets afterwards, my first reaction was to jump in the water and try to pull myself to the boat with the hook, but no luck.LET ME ROTATE THA BOAT DANGIT (a rudder or something would be a ncie addition, I don't like building stairs off all corners of my raft)I've seen many people ask to be able to build on the islands, and where I think that would be neat, I do think that it goes against the integrity of the game's design philosophy of "build raft, live on raft, die on raft" - but perhaps a section of buildable items EXCLUSIVELY for building on land would be nice? (Small ladders/steps, a rope you could toss to higher levels, maybe some climbing gear? Just a thought.)Obligatory Suggested Additions:Submersible of some sort (maybe like an old style divers suit that's attached to the raft itself for air, uses battery to pump air down etc...)Grapple Hook mechanics for the hookDifferent Biomes on Islands (winter islands, desert islands, tropical, lava, you get the idea...)More mobs (Kraken, Lazer Shark, Pirannah etc... Maybe an island could have pools of water in them, with pirannahs in that water?)A craftable map of sorts / compass / something else to help direct towards lootFeed the shark till friendly - fights the next shark for you?Harpoon gun so I can shoot that shark from my perch (2-3 hit kill would probably be fair, then lemme drag the body in like a piece of wood)Fishnet you can drag behind the boat to collect fish - just like the collection nets for gearPick this game up if you're a survival buff. Lot's of fun to be had, and likely much more to be had in the future.

UnknownError	Recommended	25.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198138911085/	This game has really good potential. It's already pretty good, and it's only in beta. Buy it, if you have someone to play it with.
Ephixa	Recommended	32.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ModDayHippie/	7-10 years ago when i was like 10-14 years old i found a game called minecraft, the game was so imersive that you felt you were actually part of the world,  could spend hours doing nothing at all. but at the same time your doing everything. this game is the same, i bought it 5 min after release and i just now decided to take a break (7 hours in). i legit thought it has been like 3 hours max, but this game, theres somthing about the graphics, and the music. that just pulls this game nicely together.
ღ lmorial ღ	Recommended	31.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198249746180/	● Very good, funny and chill game to play with friend/s to explore the whole ocean and build up your own raft. ● To be honest one of the funniest Co-op game I've ever played. I definitely won't recommend you to play this game alone. It would be ultra boring. So bring some friends and chill with the ocean :3● Only negative thing about the game is lack of content. You can't do much things other than searching islands on the ocean. It's pretty much the same after some time but still, it's really fun.
Epic Acrylic	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/epicacrylic/	Basically Skyblock from Minecraft but with an oceanic twist. Great soundtrack, looks nice, makes you feel isolated. Below the ocen surface is scary, so it persuades you to not swim under. Overall great game
Drummel	Recommended	30.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/drummel/	Definite yes for this one.  I love surival games.  You can set your own pace.  Build your raft however you want.  Research new items and upgrade simple ones into better ones with the right resource research.  There isn't a lot of content in the way of the world or creatures yet, but having played this since  itch.io I still absolutely love this game.  Some may argue that it's not worth it's asking price for the content, but for me I'm totally fine here.  I will  make my own adventures until more is added.  This is a breath of fresh air for survival games.  It's familiar yet is definitely it's own game.  I can't wait to see what the future brings.  With resource balancing and some added content the possibilities truly are limitless for this ones future.
Homophobic Harold	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198171131165/	Great game, Not huge as I managed to complete it in just under 8 hours but well worth playing. Very excited for this game going forward.
McShady	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/McShadyGaming/	Super Fun game. though i wish their was more to do on the raft and under water, Other then just jumping from island to island and only leaving because you gathered all the easy to moderate loot.(Things i think the game needs)-Bigger islands with more diverse resorces- Shallow water (For visability)- More items / gadgets to help gather resorces faster and more eficent on the raft and below water- Longer resapwn times on the shark, maybe have it regenerate 70-80 % of its health-More durability on upgraded wepons and tools (Why waste scrap and metal on something that breaks just as fast)-Stone axe, Slower and gives half as much (give use for stones) - etheir add a rutter or let the paddle drag in the water (Go to a corrner of the raft and drag the paddle to slowly rotate the raft)-Electric motors / gas moters - mapping-ability to make a small motor / sail boat when the raft gets to big come near islands-Bigger a better sails / multi sail suportOver all the game is in good shape, now all it needs is more content. Hopefuly some of this is makes its way to the game. Solid 7/10
Guacamole Nipples	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/smtsj6969/	Fun to play but needs more content.
Ewen | Noxious Networks	Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/squishyflump/	This game is amazingly fun, basic and great with some friends! This game i very good for beta, it can be improved massively and hopefully will be!+ I hope we get servers so each person can have a raft!+ More advanced weapons and building parts (Crossbows, stone walls etc)+ More exploration of bigger more dangerous islands with maybe lava or new animals!+ Building on islands?+ - Better Ending.......- Needs more interesting things on the islands!- Gets repetetive after couple hoursSome of the things that need improvement but its such fun!I think it is worth its money!
Bender	Not Recommended	5.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030744587/	Its a good game. But after a few hours of playing it you have researched everything and harvested every item you can. gets pointless. and the Shark acts like a robot. Its like clockwork with that shark. very unrealistic and becomes repetitive. even when you kill the shark. it reappears consistently every single time after 2 minutes. The islands are very unrealistic, tiny and difficult to access and they are not random gen. But the one that gets me the most is when you anchor down. the ocean stops moving. everything stops moving. the ocean is on pause while you are anchored. They have a good thing here. and with a decent amount of work this could be a very good game. but at the moment i feel like they are not working on large content updates. So maybe this game will be worth a buy in a couple of years. So at the current moment i do not recommend this game.
Razors Edge	Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/razoreqx/	Love the game in single player.  Have not played coop yet.The graphics are nice, music score is fantastic and I didnt turn it off :) Research to unlock more items to makebuild sails to direct your attention to islands and other sinking raftsThe sky is the limit what kind of party boat you want to build.  Kill a shark and make a trophy feels good after you've been harrassed by them for the start of the game.Clean water and food production is the first priority. Its hard to believe one developer and two 3d artists made this game!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h37yjwjOYSg 
Throney	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198179014993/	I got Raft for my son and I to give it a try. This game has come a long way befor it even made it to Steam.  If you play this on normal its tons of fun.  Every one keeps saying the Shark is not that hard funny thing is every time i found my self in the water old Sharkey was hot on my tell eating me most the time. Over all i would recommend this to Family & Friends. It is a very nice brake from Astronner and Don't starve together. If you like to co-op base builder surviver games  solo or with friends this game should be in your list. I see this actually leaving early access unlike to many that fall short and burn out like a sparkler in the night.
Vanirra	Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Vanirra/	For the $20 price I'm on the fence with whether or not I'd recommend the game in it's current state. I'll give it a thumbs up though because I see potential.This review is subject to change as more content is released. At its current stage I don't feel like it has much, if any, replay value.  Played a little bit of creative to see how far you can actually go with building and "beat" the game itself in about 8 hrs. Basically all your time is spent aimlessly floating around picking up floating debris. Eventually you'll find islands you may or may not be able to climb for supplies and search the sea floor beneath it for materials. Once you get the ball rolling and expand your raft and build better things, the game is just easy mode. Again, not much to the game as of right now but it definitely has potential. Pros:Nice graphics.Musics pretty chill.Fun with friends.Gives you a sense of struggle in the early stages.Cons: 1 shark. Not actually very threatening.Gets super easy as you progress.You can only build on the raft. 
Buzzfeed	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198331779985/	Officially the most polished Early Access game I've ever played. Gameplay is rock solid, the ocean is immersive, and without spoiling the story the final part of the game was interesting. Multiplayer is extremely easy to set up as well. My only issue is a lack of content, once you've seen the end of the game and you've managed hunger and thirst you run out of things to do but, as an Early Access game, this is understandable. I'd recommend the game to fans of the genre.
| Switch |	Not Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SwitchB0ard/	An enjoyable few hours.Raft runs smoothly , has multiplayer and only a few bugs (I could find). BUT.. The game provides only a few good hours. There is basically no end-game content, No enemies other than the shark, Surviving becomes super easy with "late" game utilities. They keep you assuming there is late game content long enough to go over the 2 hour refund timer.The game lacks the ability to build seperate rafts , nor building on islands. With its lack of decrative items and different building pieces. Leaving the "minecraft builder" fan a little dissapointed.The game has a good starting point, but no more than that. It is easy to see the potential for additions to the game, But without knowing if those updates will come soon or at all. It is hard to justify spending $20 right now.Overall decision : Not worth $20 (Should have been $10) or released with proper content.*Edit to clarify : My review is based on what you get at this time. The game has a good potential , but in its current state i would not recommend it.
TaziDevil	Recommended	98.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044760356/	Good game with the chance to be so much better. BUT .. once you get your raft to a reasonable size, especially if playing with friends the game gets VERY laggy and glitchy :(. We enjoy it as a family but the devs seriously need to sort out what is going on with the lag. Please devs fix the game so we can keep playing (currently stuck unable to continue).
🅻🅴🅸🅵 🅶🅶 🅿	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ptothea/	Raft is a beautiful game, really charming and has a nice vibe to itself. I recommend playing with a friend or two and explore everything it has to offer together. Start on that single piece of wood and try to survive sharks and storms together, eventually you will end up on a bigger piece of wood with nets to collect floating debris and 50 palm trees planted on the second floor for no reason at all! 
Tzunny	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tzunny/	Very relaxing, fun, addicting game when especially played with a friend.Sometimes need something new, this actually wasn't my style but i like it and i enjoy it!I didn't found any bugs yet or other frustrating stuffs in the gameplay like in other early access games, maybe i was lucky until now?!So far it's a good stable game, have only few hours into it but i plan to play it more.Give it a try if is on sale to!
SummitSR	Recommended	23.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SeniorSR/	awesome fun game, enjoyed playing it but it has few cons that really annoyed me, its a simple game can be finished in  11 hours, plus its the sort of game that you dont come back to when finished, sense the experience is very repetitive, you have ONLY one enemy which is not a big threat it's the 'shark' he could easily be killed and his bites can be easily dodge but sometimes glitchy.  the looting system is boring and very slow it really needs to be improved, also there isn't much out there to loot its the same materials you'll have to gather million times, (wooden planks, plastic, leaves,rocks...) and few others that are slightly more rare, another thing is that it lacks the variety of tools and items that can be crafted. this game has such a big potential it can definitely get rid of these down sides. I do recommend it but not worth the full price
SSSDante	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088860189/	Great for 5-10 hours, especially with friends. One of those rare survival games that actually has "an ending" and something to work towards. Recommend it for a game night with friends!
Crow	Recommended	33.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrissCrow/	A nice laid back, enjoy building and surviving game, favors the multitasker but once you realize a few things the game becomes fairly easy, but in a good way, well worth the money, still playing this,That said, there are a few things I'd suggest,Rudder, something to rotate the raft would be nice, like a rudder or have the paddle make it so you can rotate the raft some how.Backpack, personal storage, I've had to throw away so much just because I don't have 20 storage boxs laying around.Sort button in inventories.More, the game tickles the prospect of power, with batteries, would love to see something like a wind turbine, to power other things, like a fridge, water pump, or even a motor.Shark spikes, traps, hooks,Honestly I think this game can be so much more, and doesn't need to be too grounded in reality, would be fun to see other creatures to survive against or with, even if its DLC that cost $9.99, would love to explore wrecked ships, floating plains, or even abandon town boats, maybe with a mistory or something, or badies to fight off for loot, the game has a good foot hold, a good base game, just needs to expand on the idea now.
Amorphous	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Amorphous-/	This game is enjoyable for the price. BEWARE gameplay is around 13 hours and there is no replay value until there are new updates. I am glad that I had made this purchase. I hope to see new content added to the game.
JiiPee	Not Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041756601/	TL:DR at the bottom--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The premise for the Raft looks really promising. I enjoy playing unique survival games and Raft scratches that itch for me, though it doesn't come without its flaws.You start the game from the scratch on a tiny raft and with a single hook in your hand. You can't steer the raft (at this point yet) and you just go along with the waves gathering whatever materials you can and expanding your raft. Occasionally a shark attacks your raft and tries to tear it apart piece by piece, but you can fend it off if you have build the right tools.Like in every survival game you have to keep yourself fed and hydrated in order to survive. You get food from various sources like fishing for example, and drinkable water can be obtained by purifying saltwater. In order to do that you have to research and build water purifier.Talking about research, you can't build everything from the get go. You can only build the very basic structures, but the more advanced stuff needs to be researched first and to do that you first have to gather advanced materials which you can use to research new stuff at the Research table. I really like this feature, because it slightly adds depth to the game. As time goes on you can even build sails which allows you to steer your raft to where you want it to go.As I mentioned before, the game doesn't come without its flaws. There are various of small scale bugs every now and then, but in my opinion the biggest flaw is the lack of content. There's just not much that you can do in this game yet. At the time of writing this, I've clocked in roughly 8 hours and I've already experienced (almost) everything that the game has to offer. The only thing that I haven't experienced yet is the recently added Large island which I haven't found yet.Building is interesting, but after couple hours of playing you've pretty much builded everything that there is to build.Surviving is super easy after getting used to it, because there aren't many enemies or hazards that can threaten your life. The only way you can die is to die from hunger/thirst, drowning or getting eaten by shark. Food and water are never really a problem, because you can get both of them pretty easily and the shark is an annoyance at most. After a while I even stopped caring about the shark entirely and kept diving in the ocean for materials. The only time I pay attention to the shark is when its attacking my raft.The game lacks in locations too. You can explore small/large islands, abandoned rafts and even rigs if you find them, but there's nothing exciting in them after you've seen them once. The game needs more interesting locations that you can find and explore.But the game is still in early-access and the developers keep adding more stuff to it as time goes on. I only wish that they triple or even quadruple the content by the time the game gets released, because I want to get more people playing this in the future. I hope to see stuff like ocean floor exploration, various creatures like giant octo♥♥♥♥♥ attacking your raft, big islands with tons of rare materials to find, new hazards etc.The premise looks really promising for this game and only the imagination is the limit.Pros:+ Waterworld theme+ Survival mechanics+ Raft BuildingCons:- Not much to do yet- Lack of locations to explore- Lack of enemies and hazards- Lack of building strugtures and objectives- Extremely short research progression- Various (early-access) bugsDo I recommend?Not in its current early-access state, but if the developers triple or even quadruple the current content by the time the game's actual release date, then in that case yes I do recommend this.Verdict: 6/10 - Slightly above average survival game with not much to do yet.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TL:DR - I like the game, but can't recommend it yet because it lacks content.
Kennyboiii	Recommended	40.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheKennyboiii/	I got the game day after relase with 6 of my friends looking for a new good game and this game has perfectly fit that spot. First lancuh was 8 hours of play time nonstop this game is simple yet complex it makes you stay on your toes and makes your team into a real team trying to feed and get everyone water on a raft half the size of your room. I've been reccomending everyone this game and I will continure to play and tell people to get this amazing game. If you dont have it already wtf are you doing.
Vash(88)	Not Recommended	52.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jbaketkd/	Raft has, some how, taken the steam charts by storm.  And I get it; it's easy to grasp, simple, fun without asking too much of the player, relaxing, pleasant, and helps to fill peoples' need for new early access survival games.  Like most survival games, there are three aspects that the player must deal with: nutrition, enemies, and building.  This, however, is where the game runs into its downfall.The "survival" aspect, eating, drinking, finding food and water is fun, and a little tough at first, but after you get a handle on the game, food water are no longer on your mind.The enemy of the game. the shark, is a fun little timer that keeps the player on edge at first, but quickly becomes just another aspect that the player will ignore along with hunger and thirst.  (my raft is so big, I can no longer hear the shark attacking, so I just fix the spots he eats)So after you have a self sustaining raft and metal weapons that make shark-kabobs, there is still the creative aspect of the building game that we can enjoy.... right?!NOPE!  The game is currently so unbelievably un-optimized that with my, admittedly, massive raft, I can no longer play the game.  I have my specs posted on my profile, and lets just say it is insulting to see a game that looks like this run at 10 fpsNow this is 100% on the host's side.  Other people with half the computer can join and play no problem, but maintaining the server requires WAY too much effort out of a computer for a game like this.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417064763So what am I to do next time?  Just make a small raft and log on just to eat, drink and kill a shark every ten minutes...........One of, if not the most important features of a game like this is the creative aspect that is given to the players.  Whelp, to hell with your imagination, because you will be quickly limited by the game's extremely low quality.Also, the devs DO NOT WANT CRITICISM.  They are unprofessional and crass on the forums locking discussions that break zero forum rulesI have a lot of steam friends which is where well over half of my game time has come from given that I can no longer play on my raft
Notorious Nibba	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DieFeuerdrache/	Great quality and fun survival game. I don't think its worth $20 though. Would say Raft is worth maybe $10 or $15 .
ZSnow	Recommended	26.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zsnowwind/	Buy it if you have friends to play with
-   .julez.a	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thejoolz/	It always feels a little special when an Early Access title captures your full attention. Raft does just that. What's there right now is pretty impressive for how early in its development it is. A very relaxed (aside from some tense shark encounters) and peaceful game. If you've played survival/crafting games before, you know what to expect, but the added twist of slowly upgrading your makeshift raft feels really rewarding. I didn't give the co-op a chance yet, but I plan to get some friends together when the next big update rolls out. Absolutely love this game so far.
Boogey	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/boogeytroll/	Slightly overpriced, at the time of writing, survival game with better than normal idea behind it. No zombies, no humanoid enemies or dinosaurs. Recent patches have introduced some more enemies and a school of fish.Raft has obvious lack of content and no patches have really aimed to fix that on the core level. After you get past the "wtf, I need food, I need water, DON'T TOUCH ME I'M ABOUT TO DIE" -phase you have you can relax, start building your raft bigger and do research to automate collecting stuff and to build better stuff. Your nemesis, the Shark, and later the Birdie, becomes quickly almost absolete and your game is about hopping to islands, diving and finding other abandoned rafts to get to the next phase of building. If you know what you are doing you go thru the phases very fast and you reach the current story "end". Game continues with added content of bigger islands and more recipies, but it's all the same really. Replayability is almost zero, unless you enjoy seeing what each of your friends would like to build.Devs are active and the game will improve, but the development has been really slow. Bones are there for good improvements and the playthru at the moment is very enjoable. Recommendation, but be aware you will not get too many hours for your hard earned money.
Floyd The Barber	Recommended	33.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053422548/	Raft is without a doubt an extrememly fun and time consuming game. I was a little skeptical about this game as it is still in early access but decided to give it a try.  This is a typical build and survive game but takes place out on the open ocean. You will spend a large majority of your time standing at the edge of your raft tossing out your hook and trying to grab every piece of material you can find, as this is a must. You want to keep building your raft while creating new items as that is where most of the fun lies. The game took me a couple save profiles before I got the hang of how to start off and after my third attempt I felt like I had the core of the game already figured out. It is quite simple at times, build, cook food, purify water, and occasionally defend your raft from the shark that contanly respwans and swims around your raft. These core mechanics are actually quite annoying after a few hours. You want to start focusing on a new task or project but must constanly be getting food, cooking it, eating it, and rinse and repeat at a rate that just feels too fast to actually enjoy the other aspects of the game. The shark takes awhile to kill and as soon as you do another one comes in shortly after making the mechanic tedious and boring. Luckily, there are islands you will occasioannly come across. Unfortunatly, these islands are pretty boring and lackluster. Most of them all look the same and getting on them is an extreme pain as most are raised far off the surface of the water. This means you almost always have to build to get around the island. The big problem with this is that you can only build from your raft, meaning you can't build on the island. This makes exploring these islands a real pain and you will most likely just want to pass on by them, despite the good amount of material and food found of them. As far as bugs go, there are not too many for a game in this state of release. Every once in a while my hook will glitch up and I can't use it but this can be simply fixed by switching items. The shark will occasionally disappear only to reappear out of nowhere, sometimes clipping right through the islands. Another weird bug is that sometimes while drifting at sea, materials in the water will stop spawning. So far I have been easily able to fix this by changing direction or lowering and rasing the sails. While at this moment I may not have sunk too many hours into it, I can tell the game still has a lot more hours of gameplay before it starts getting stale. And that is where the main problem is right now. While the first bit of gameplay there is a lot to do, after a while the world gets repetitive and boring. And I can already tell that once I research and aquire all the objects and items in the game, there will be nothing left really to do. However, even with its faults, this game is extremely fun and that is what matters. Overall, the game is a pretty solid game for being early access, and that honestly makes the game even more interesting. If this game continues to get updated with more content I know for sure this game will be a great game. As for now, it is a good game to pass the time and to play with some friends. I would recommend giving this game a shot and showing some support for it, as this will most likely make the developers want to keep working on it.
Jimin	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rayysatomi/	very good game. Only problem is i don't have friends to play :(
-Teako-	Recommended	5.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AirWaveGamer/	A very fun game to play but must be played with friends to see the true potential. A solid game with solid mechanics 9/10.
\t	Not Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154088025/	I have spent some time learning this game despite the fact that there is only a small wiki. The game is meh... The game certainly looks fun but tbh you have so little to explore and play after you gather some items. In other words, I found the sole objective of this game, in the end, is to wait for the shark attack and island to search.This game needs some serious changes. There is nothing to be explored under deep water and certain items can only be found near islands. At last, we think that the continued spawning of shacks is just to annoy players and thus make them occupied. Buy this game on sale or wait until some updates.
Drafter	Recommended	37.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Drafter24/	Definitely one of the better crafting/survival games I've played. The grind is intense, especially early on, but I guess you'd expect that if you were trying to survive on a 2x2 square on the ocean. It does get easier to manage as you get on your feet, but the degradation of the tools is just ridiculous. It's almost a deal killer for me (that and having to constantly fight off the shark), but I've gotten enough enjoyment out of the game so far, I can't not recommend it. It's alot of fun for something different, but I don't know if it will be a long term game for me personally. It feels like one of those games you get to a certain point and you don't really know what else to do, if the grind doesn't wear you down first.I do realize it's in early access and I will say it's worth $20 easily. I just hope there is alot more coming in the future and hopefully some way to eventually not have to deal with the shark as much once you get your base built up (without having to use a million metal ingots).7/10
The Patriarchy's Favorite Son	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/atleast8courics/	Pretty fun with a buddy, but very bare bones. Once you start getting your thirst and hunger under control through water purifying and fishing, your only obstacle in the game is the shark which is pathetically easy to deal with and repair any sort of damage it does. There's a creative mode, too, if that, uh... floats your boat (kill me), but beyond building the raft of your dreams there's zero point to it. The shark doesn't attack you or your raft. Your meters don't decay. There's not even choppy water. It's very zen, and probably why I've put in six more hours than I probably would have otherwise.Speaking of, I'd wager there's about four to six hours worth of content right now, and there isn't really an end game in sight as the game is still in early alpha. Updates seem a little slower than I'd probably like, leaving me to think I'll probably revisit this game in a year or so instead of playing through update after update. I had no issues keeping 60fps, and I don't exactly have a powerhouse machine. Bugs were... shockingly few and far between. At one point my empty cup simply vanished from my inventory, leaving me dying of thirst for the five seconds it took me to make another.Ultimately, I'll recommend it--it shows promise and I'm a sucker for crafting games--but absolutely do not buy if you want a deep game (ironic, since you're on open water here)... or if you're a FedEx employee. WIIIILSOOOON!
Space	Not Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Success/	Really isn't any content to this game at the moment...1. Collect trash to expand your raft but you have to spend  A LOT of time collecting floating trash to be able to do something cool.2. Kill a shark over and over again.3. Kill a seagul over and over again.That is it...
DarkFade7k	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DkFd7k/	The only game that has actually got me to say out loud, "Thank god for humans polluting the water with junk." You know it’s wrong, but so god damn right at the same time.(Edit. 21 days to get to the end(?)Things I'd like to see:*. Throwable spears, like the hook but capable of (short range) damage.*. Variety of sharks, like a hammerhead that can damage the boat by ramming, or two Tiger sharks that do half the damage but attack at the same time. Or maybe a whale shark that can tip you off of the raft and into the water.
papymakecoffee	Recommended	24.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tchointchointchointchoin/	Excellent games, regular updates that make me start the game again and again
Jaeger Meister	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059361031/	When first looking at Raft the first thing I noticed was the four tags of the apocalypse for steam games; Early access, Survival, Open World, and Crafting. Seeing this worried me but the game reminded me of the movie waterworld and peaked my interest. So I forked over the twenty bucks and was crossing my fingers that this would be a good game. Raft is such a fresh installment in a very oversaturated field of survival crafting games but adds the element of being out on an ocean v.s land. Learning how the game works takes little time. There are a few bugs that I encountered but its extremely rare. This is a great game to play with your friends as well. 10/10 would reccomend that people give it a try. it really is worth the money.
Icarus	Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RolandVaryan/	Cool Concept!Pros:-Awesome Crafting-Organized menus-Good graphics and optimizationCons:(and a glaring one for me unfortunately :/ )-No matchmakingI like this games style for sure but unfortunately it can get boring quickly unless you have a group of steam friends already interested in the game. For me, not many of mine are yet. So until some change their minds or matchmaking is implemented I have to play alone. I tried it alone with an open mind, and it just got too lonely too quickly. I greatly enjoy cooperative survival, or a story rich element with npc's. While this has the former, it's not in a format I can use yet. I cautiously recommend it, as I think it shows massive potential.
Sober4Life	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198802491006/	needs some new content but great game
Smo Huffmister	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/smohuff/	Great potential! But for the time being, 70% of the game is about stuffing your face with water and food to stay alive, 20% poking a shark with a pointy stick that is trying to destroy your raft, and you are left with 10% of survival fun. Will ask for a refund atm and play something different, when this is less of an eating simulator I will come back with various friends.
Beemer	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/beemerwt/	If you don't know already, Raft is a game based around being stranded on a raft in the middle of the sea. Over time you accumulate debris as they float toward you in order to survive, create, and progress the limited story. This is the best time I've ever had at sea.The aesthetic of the game is stellar. Everything looks like it's supposed to be in this game. In addition to the aesthetic, it is very well optimized. You can create massive structures without lagging and see objects from very far away. I have already completed the game, but I am compelled to do it again, which is amazing for how much stuff is actually in the game. Certainly worth every penny.
slapchop209	Recommended	10.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Slapchop20/	awesome game to play with friends, a little hard solo, i apreciate what the developers are doing and hope to see more from this game i really hope it finishes. I always have a bad taste in my mouth with early realeases, but at the same time its been awesome so far :)!
@bit(ht!ts	Not Recommended	16.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/emerik_de_boss/	I really do like the game, but it is not worth 19.99$ for how little content it has.
Forgewolf	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/forgewolf/	If you want something that is calming, but time consuming, this game is good. I can tell a lot of love was put into this game and look forward to seeing it evolve further over time.
Lucifer	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/robocup69/	So far the game is great to play with or without friends although it's way more fun to play together but nontheless the game is very relaxing and calm, it's perfect for late evenings.I've 'finished' the game with my friend in exactly 6 hours and to be honest the plot twist at the end was very surprising and intriguing. Of course you can continue to sail the seas and build/decorate your raft but right now I think there isn't enough content to keep you interested for days or even weeks.
JHarps	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JHarps/	This game is a very relaxing survival game, with interesting crafting options and a unique approach to the survival genre.     I decided to leave a review due to the mixed reviews, and I agree that the game does lack some content if you are looking for an action packed survival, but this game can be quite fun with a couple friends, or even on your own.  You have to look up some of the stuff to really understand what you are doing as it seems some people just dont understand from the beginning, and neither did I.  But if you want ~20 ish + hours out of a survival game then here you go.  Thats just for one gentle run through of the game, but I believe replay value will come with time away from the game, and updates.   
Sebo	Recommended	151.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sebothemaximus/	You start on small few blocks raft, while below the shark is waiting for you to snap your arms and legs off. I must say, shark was really annyoing me off each time I went to explore into islands below and not to mention how many times he destroyed blocks in raft, like a lot!The first thing you see on sea are plastic, planks, barrels, palm leafs, use ur hook to get them faster but beware, you got limit on all used items (hook, axe, bow...) and once that limit is out, you will need to make one again. Once you had a long adventure through sea you will start to see islands (from small to big ones, hah thats what she said lul), small build boats with a crate on to get. Now if you want a lot of grind, park the raft at island and get as many resources you can.BONUS HINT: If you can get antennas and computer working with a battery you will find a secret base which reveals a bit of the story of the game.  Beware about plant farming, the seaguls will try to eat your plants, so try place scarecrow near plants.As for hunger and thirst, these two are going down insanely fast on easy mode which feels like hard survival The Forest as an example, I cant imagine on extreme mode or hard mode on raft but ill test it out soon as well.Singleplayer feels lonely if im honest but is more fun with a co op friend or more friends because you can build and get resources faster and learn faster too. Me and my friend at beginning of the game didnt knew what to do but pick up stuff from ocean, but as time went on we started to figure all out what to get and where to get the resources for specific item, and after long hours of grinding and exploring we got a huge house raft built with a great farming system and my god it is fun :DThe game is EA (early access) so expect bugs too, ill name few here:- SLEEP DYING BUG (while your thirst and hunger and health are near zero and if you lay or sleep in bed and when you die when your co op friend picks you up and puts you in the bed and then you wake up you cant move mouse around with your character, which you will have to restart the game again to fix it). Again, this happended to me many times, definitly needs a fix.- SHARK NO CLIP BUG (Speaking of shark, god damn I hate him so much xD its just unreal. So yea, if your near the island and your exploring, well the shark is gonna attack you from no clipping through island into your face and rip it off. The shark is cheating, pls nerf it.) Definitly needs a fix as well.I expect the game to be fixed and progress as well, im excited for new content from devs, keep it up!What can I say, its an awesome game and I recommend it if you like sailing through the sea like a pirate.Cheers!
SepSlither	Recommended	25.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xSlitherx/	Early Access Review
Hσrizσn	Recommended	17.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yusenn/	fun , even better if they added more stuff into the game and the hunger is more annoying than the shark . Grinding resources to expand is the most time consuming thing in the game .
Rigo	Recommended	16.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999337530/	everything is ok except the shark, the purpose of the shark is to give player some stress to feel survival, but i feel more annoyed than reawrd to kill the shark cause the shark respawned almost in no time. maybe a 10-20 mins of timer for shark to respawn, now it's like a fly around you that you never get rid of it. I guess it's good for farming shark meat as a great food recourse, but other than that, danm the shark is annoying, not hard to kill but annoying.but other game features are cool, there will be more new feature and change in the game and I'm looking forward to it. more stuff can build on raft of course, maybe new island, new material to farm and so on. in conclusion this game has a lot of potential and I hope dev can finish this to let it walk out of the eraly access zone.

xanthalus	Not Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198143055724/	An unstable and empty ocean with not much to do -  I find it very "Sea of Thieves" esque in that there are 3 menial tasks you have to do endlessly.  Think Subnautica made with Scrap Mechanic graphics but you can only go 20 feet down and out of the vast ocean the there is a single lone enemy,  a shark.  Just one, one skin, one kind with one attack type.It feels like they came up with this nice shiny box, but it's empty.  In order to give us players something to do they coded the food and water bars to degrade rapidly, and made your raft a beaver-shark spawn.  This means you'll be fighting the needs of not dying due to malnutrition but also the beaver-sharks who for some reason love eating wood pieces of your boat.  The entirety of the game is spent collecting ocean garbage and fixing the beaver-shark damage. Game hard crashes often, but doesn't have an autosave feature.  Get somewhere new?  Better save.  Want to access your storage boxes?  Better save again.  Find an island or abandoned raft?  Oops, there it went.For an Alpha release product, this has neither the depth nor quality of play that I expected.  There is no story or mystery - no real reason why you're here.  You just are ... and at the 4th hour and at least 8th crash, I begin to wonder why I'm here too.It does have nice music though, I'll give it that.
Blast	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/76561198017682557/	Suffers the same fate a lot of survival games do.Beyond the opening phase it's less of a struggle to survive and more of a grind. You're not really in any real danger, you're just repeating a farming routine to keep your food and water up. The shark is a nuisance but not a genuine danger, and the environment is about as threatening as a gold fish. 
[NNG] Alianorx	Not Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/YTAlianorx/	Nah. After 2 hours you feel like youve done everything and the rest is just a grind fest to make a bigger boat. Going to wait 6 months then come back to see if its any better.(Needs more content for $20)
AKA Teddy	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FinalAtrium780/	If you enjoy building games you’ll most likely enjoy this aswell. The uniqueness of being stuck on a raft that you expand yourself using materials you find as you journey across the infinite sized ocean is allot of fun. Definitely recommend playing with friends!Pros:-Enjoyable gameplay mechanics-4 player co-op-huge map with islands and other structures.-good time waster/ leisure gameCons:- repetitive after awhile- not buggy but feels like there could have been more added.
mariogamer296	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198443980734/	Amazing. Creative. Fun. Those three words Are the best way to Describe Raft in, well, Three words. This game is worth the buy, if your into an Adventure Building survival game. That takes place on the ocean.Some people might say this game 'Isn't worth it' , But mostly because...1. They Don't like Survival games. (Or just this one...)2. They Haven't Figured out Creative mode is a thing.( Game Modes, and what their like. )Creative Mode      You can build SO MANY THINGS In that Mode, Its crazy. Like a huge bird statue. Or a... Boat. Even a shark, or a huge minecraft Grass block! No need to worry about hunger or thirst, or getting building materials. Just let your creativity run wild! ( No, really, I mean it. )Survival Mode      Now, This is More challenging than Creative mode. ( I think we already Should Know that. ) You start off on a 2 x 2 Raft, with a hook. And a shark who wants his breakfast. This mode, You Need to watch hunger and thirst, Not to mention Gathering materials Is a thing you HAVE to do in order to survive. On your Jounrey, Find Islands, The 'Ending' , And more! Also, Ducks. I love myself my Duck.MultiPlayer      Not much to say about this, exept... ITS SO FUN! I've played this before, and I loved it. Byfar, the greatest thing this game has to offer... Besides Creative mode.Welp, Thats Raft in a nutshell. Now that you ( Might have )   Read this, go read a few other comments, And Get the answer to the big question... Will you play Raft?? 
Emrys	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198229065792/	I don't play survival game very often but this one gave me a brand new experience. No fierce enemy, no raid, the game is set in a tranquil endless ocean. You live and sleep on your own boat, try to build your own galaxy space ship based on the small boat in the beggining of the game, avoid the attack from shark or even kill the shark to win your reward. Another interesting part that drives me playing this game is the co-op. Raft gives you a pleasant feeling when you play with your friends. The ship feels like a home. You get on the boat, and divide the work. One man will take care of the food, while others collect leaves, board, plastic and metal, or build the ship, or gather and try to defend the boat by killing the shark. You can feel the friendship building when you eat the delicious tuna cooked by your chef, when you stab the shark with your friends and helping them avoid shark's attack, when you guys get on the material island and collecting all the necessary stuff, even when you put dead shark's head on your boat and writting♥♥♥♥♥♥stuff on the board. It is like living on the ocean, indeed. Only one flaw drew my attention. Raft gives you an ending after playing for about 2 hours. You will arrive on a big base like a drilling platform. On the platform it will give you the information about why you guys living on the boat and what happened to this world. But the game never ends. After the drilling platform you will have to survive on the boat forever. You repeat on meeting an island regularly, collect materials on it and leaves. The only motivation that drives you keep on playing this game is your boat. I mean the only thing you can do, or hope, is expanding your boat. This is why I only have 8 hours on record. After realizing this point I give up on the game quickly since I don't wanna waste my time on simplying building a ship. I hope the corporation will give us more interersting goals in the future. Anyway, the game has its own reason for being on the top sellers, and I defenitely recommend this game to everyone. Hope you guys enjoy your time on the ocean!
Raptorz	Recommended	34.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/raptorz90/	Really cool surival game, but I would recommend to play it with some friends. Alone it can be a little bit boring.
SaugaKing	Recommended	33.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198290229352/	Oh man i love raft, very chill game.  In the beginning it is hard, you are challenged with juggling hunger, thrist and collecting materials. but once you get situated it becomes easier, and you get to build a sweet raft.  As of now there isn't that much content, but enough. AND the devs are listening to the community, if you want to check out the discord they have suggestion tabs that you can vote on things you'd like to see in the game.
RushingBuzZ	Recommended	36.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106419870/	This game is fun without friends, but when you have at least one more person it is so much more fun, great game with good mechanics and muliplayer
Stormrise	Recommended	45.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197994829545/	This is a nice, relaxing and enjoyable game.  Need a break from shooting warships?  Kick back on your raft, collect some stuff, build a little cabin.
Clementine	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NastyaPetrova/	Raft is lovely game <3
Dovahrex	Not Recommended	22.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dovahrex/	This game has potential but needs a lot of work before it can really shine. There needs to be a lot of balancing (I played on normal):1. Your hydration and hunger meters drop way too fast. You will spend most of your time eating and drinking every couple of minutes. This should be changed as the human body can go for long lengths of time without water and even longer without food. Plus it just is too tedious and boring the way it is implemented now. 2. Certain materials can only be found where islands are but you spend way too much time worrying about the shark to collect said materials. You can make shark bait which distracts the shark for a short period of time but it is made from a certain kind of fish that seems to be an extremely rare drop when fishing. The shark is also extremely annoying. No sure way to damage it until it starts attacking your boat and even then it is just cheaper to let the shark destroy part of your boat and then repair it as the spear is too expensive. 3.Each island has a limited amount of materials which forces you to keep moving on. This is good but random items stop floating to you when you stop anywhere so if you decide to stop at an island and you have a low amount of crafting materials  then you will have to leave the island behind. Items should still float to you even if you stop. 3. Crafted items cost A LOT of materials. I felt like most of my playtime (other than eating & drinking) was throwing the hook out trying to get every little item because it all gets used up when crafting just a couple of items. Items like the battery run out of juice way too fast. Even on Creative mode it seems to run out extremely fast. Crafted items also run out of durability way too fast. I made the best hook and fishing rod and they both dropped tremendously after just a few uses. It is better to use the basic versions. 4. You have a sail that pulls you in the direction you want to go but if you are going against the wind then you need to build a paddle. There is no way to turn your boat around manually. This sucks because if you built collecting nets on one side of the boat, you can miss out on collecting items due to your boat facing the wrong way. It would be really great if you could build a steering wheel and a rudder so you can turn your boat where you want to go.5. Currently, you are supposed to go where the wind blows but it seems like it only blows one way. It would be a lot more fun if the developers made it where you could freely explore once you craft items like a steering wheel and a rudder. I'd love to turn my small raft into a giant pirate like ship. It sucks seeing items or other boats float away and having no easy way to get to them. 6. Currently, the customization is very bad. Taking the time to make paint seems really grindy and the colors are terrible. Also there are no flags :(Overall, this has tons of potential and could compete with others like Subnautica and The Forest. Hopefully the developers consider changes like the ones I suggested as the game is really repetitive and boring as it comes now. For $20, you should look elsewhere like The Forest ($20.00) or Subnautica ($25) and just wait for this to go on sale or get more updates.
Derezzed	Not Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sceleten3122/	I bought this game in hopes that it would be the survival game I have been waiting for but it unfortunately isn't. It turns into a building simulator as soon as you get a farm, grill, and water purifier down causing the game to lose the whole "Survival" aspect and put you into a lifeless ocean with no enemy variety other than a shark and even then its not really fighting the shark but hitting it off your boat over and over until it dies. The crafting gets repetitive with not much variety maybe 12 different resources or so and very little island exploration which I would have liked to see. Survival is easy and not skill based in any way leaving little more than what seems to be a very simplistic maintenance game with little consequences to dying other than losing your items on you which are very easy to just craft again giving the game almost no sense of risking items doing risky things like most survival games have. I have played till the end in hopes of maybe getting a new crafting book or anything other than the very limited crafting possibilities they give you start-mid game but yet have been rewarded with just repetitive activities and farming up to create a bigger base with absolutely no payoff. I do however want to take time to recognize the things this game does right such as the great atmosphere they make using the art style, music, and excellent item models besides 1 or 2 things. Another thing this game does great is a strong interesting start it gives you a 2x2x1 raft with just a single hook to get items giving you a difficult start and seemingly good progression system and this progression system does feel good until you hit anywhere near the end which is only 4 hours in if ur not messing around which leaves you with getting rare materials that offer nothing too great that you absolutely need and improves gameplay so it becomes a very very dull game of just floating around on a simple water base forever. The comparison between these two should be illegal but I am going to do it anyway; This game feels like a very poorly and underfunded version of Subnautica even though I know it had a much smaller dev team and is still fresh out of the gates with lots of room to improve. Subnautica was a much better made game with heavy amounts of variety between flora and fauna with lots of lore, exploration, and beauty whereas this game just has beauty which quickly turns to boredom. I do have hope for these developers and I really would like to change this review someday but as of this specific build on this specific date I cannot recommend this game.
hotGrillsixpack	Recommended	11.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wowcupcakesyum/	This game is great. Had a lot of fun fighting sharks and grabbing all the wood I could find. My only complaint is that this game ruined the friendship of my gaming group that has been formed since our days in Azeroth. This game has turned my companions into very toxic players that usually you would only see in the League of Legends Rift. Was good game but now I have no friends to play with.
Big Gooey Squid	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/frankfukin1/	please add more content..more caracters..more crafts..more challenges... ennemies etc... turn this into an open world multiplayer experience so we can meet strangers. or maybe not i dnt know... feels like there is something missing here.....overall its a nice chilling game
MJY	Recommended	36.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052646088/	its good for me its 40 hrs, then there isn`t enough of mats to built fast enough to make something nice, right now its made to make u use the game slowly to built, if u got a goal to make a building or ship u might pass 40 hrs, update is coming , wait for it to buy this game. game is fun and has a lot of potential, but after 40 hrs if u are still at the first lv of the raft that means its going slowly and repetitive. worth checking out if u are into this type of game
Ollmeister	Not Recommended	9.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001293656/	A game with a lot of potential. But with a price tag at 19,99€ you'd expect more content even if it is in early access stage.

Manspider	Not Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/91106315/	The game is kinda cool and all, but i feel like it should cost 25% of what it costs now. In the start of the game, there's a lot to do and explore, but there's not much left after a couple of hours. The possitive things about the game, is that it looks very nice, the gameplay is smooth, the progression system is nice, but that's pretty much everything. The final platform thing was kinda dissapointing; I was expecting some blueprints to make like, sick machines and♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you only found some posters and loot. 1 of the major things they should've done before 1.0, was giving the items you drop a unique model, not just a box. Although it's fun, i feel slightly robbed and think this is a game that should've gotten worked on much more before realesing it, considering the price, that is.
Nobody	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/meleemonkee/	Lots of potential sure, but for $20 it feels like a less fleshed out Subnautica. Also would be nice if the shark stayed away for a few days to make it feel like he's worth killing, and not just there to minorly inconvenience you. Kinda sad how every video game makes sharks constantly hostile towards you. Stranded deep had it right when it came to sharks. They were mysterious and intimidating, though they HAD it right, but butched it later. Would be great to see other passive/hostile sea life as well, maybe some dolphins or even orcas to fight off the shark a bit. On another note, I understand you have to eat and drink in real life, but it feels like every five or ten minutes I am either dying of hunger or thirst. It's not hard to get food or clean water, but it feels tedious to constantly throw water to boil every two min just to not die. In it's current state I would only reccomend getting the game if you like seeing how a game developes its way towards a "better experience". Other than that, maybe just wait until more content drops. It's too bad we can't give a review in the middle, because that's where I would put it.Edit: Would be nice if the people on the main menu didn't stare into my soul, and rain actually watered crops.
Rider9530	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rider9530/	It's good and fun for a while, however after sometime it gets boring.but worth the price.
Topsy Kretts	Not Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BostonKingKush/	This has the potential to be so much fun, but I seem to be stuck in an endless loop of struggling to catch food, cook food, eat food, get water, purify water, drink water, (repeat 2-3 times for half full stats), stab shark 4 times to get it off my raft foundation, and then maybe get some building done IF I have time before I have to sleep and start ALL over again. This game definitely needs the food/drink timing/consumption rates revisted DESPERATELY (a la The Forest, which has it down PERFECTLY) and the frequency of the shark attack reduced to once every 10 minutes instead of once every 4-ish minutes. Killing a shark while you're in the water (stab as he opens his mouth) or killing it as it attacks your raft (either method takes 12 hits with wooden spear) only grants you about 2 minutes of freedom before another shark appears, that time frame also should be increased. For now I say this game is too much of an aggrivating grind to enjoy on "normal" mode at all.Additionally, I forgot to mention, the game does look fantastic in 4K.
パブロゲインズブール	Recommended	5.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PabloGainborough/	It´s a great game to play with your friends.I absolutely reccomend this game for having a funny time with your friends trying to survive.I really liked this game so much!!
[BRO] Jerambe	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jerambe/	You spawn on a raft. You start cleaning the ocean of debris to make your raft bigger. Sharks get mad because you are taking their stuff, and eat your raft. If you haven't read Old Man and the Sea, this is pretty much the video game version of the book. Now I feel the need to pollute the ocean to help stranded survivors who need my precious junk.10/10 would chant "sharkbait oo-ha-ha" everytime I use Shark Bait.
Astropipe	Recommended	77.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ASTROPIPE/	Fun alone or fun with friends, being with 13 people on a raft in hard mode screaming for the shark eating your raft, discussing roles who does what and working towards the end goal.Fantastic in every way possible.Worth the wait, can't wait to see it grow to it's full potential.

alkalola13	Recommended	14.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/alkalola13/	Great game I have loved it since it was made in a beta stage around 1 year ago. It is a lot of to play as you are trying to survive on a raft and avoid the shark which is trying to kill you and break your raft. One of the thing you have to do in this game is to collect materials to build and make your raft bigger. But sometimes you hit an island and may stop so you buy paddels to get unstuck. You make lots of tools to help you in your journey on the raft. But sometimes you will paddel a long way from were materials spawn and drift to you and you can be stuck with no materials drifting to you and have to paddel back to get more. But I would recommend this game to everyone to play, it is my new favourite game and I think the creaters did an amazing job on this game!
Aggressive Bungee Cord	Recommended	24.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027861961/	This is quite a fun game, and it's an even better experience when playing with friends. The game looks great, soundtrack is nice, and is a nice way to spend some time! There are only a few problems with the game however. The biggest problem has got to be the player's drive to play the game. Yes, I'm well aware the game is still being developed and the devs are working hard on  updating this game, but I know that I, at same times, and some of my friends just became bored because we ran out of stuff to do. There's only so much you can do while stuck in the middle of the ocean, and until you start to reach the endgame, nothing is really driving the player to keep on moving forward. Another problem I have with the game are the frequent shark attacks. Your raft will periodically be assaulted by a shark that almost always is stalking the player. About every five minutes, it will relentlessly focus on one tile of your raft and try to destroy it, and the only way to fend off the shark is to stab it with a spear. My only problem is that this gives the player little time to do what they want and are forced to babysit their sea vessle for extended periods of time. This also discourages people from building creative bases in fear that the shark will destroy a foundation somewhere and cause all your hard work to be swallowed by the sea. I think the shark attacks may contribute to that absent drive I talked about before, because players are punished for building creative structures. What I think would improve this would be to maybe extend the time between shark attacks from 5 minutes to maybe 15 minutes, but have the attacks be a lot more intense. You could still stop the shark from destroying a tile, but make it so if you're not responsible for your ship, you will get punished. This could be similar to another game I like called Don't Starve. While the system isn't perfect, the longer you survive, the more hounds will be sent to attack you every 4-7 days or so. It gets harder as you go on, and you are forced to put aside a little time making traps or setting up some sort of defence to help you stop them. I think raft could also adopt something like this, like the longer you let the shark live, the more violent it will become. This will give you some kind of grace period for quite a while while still having the shark be a threat. Now I know this is a run-on review, and probably nobody will read to the bottom of this, but I thank you for your time. I did ramble on for quite a while what I think this game could do to be better, but I still do like this game, and that's why im criticizing it, so it can be an even better game, and I do recommend you buy it.

Kitty	Not Recommended	10.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198288803223/	At this point I along with 2 family members have given this game a good 5 1/2 hours of play time, even though we wanted to quit within 2. I wanted to give it time to explore all the options later on in game and we also played at Normal level. I will say, I loved the concept and even appreciate the idea and believe if they continue balancing the game it could be amazing. but once again I feel stuck with a game where it is all about eating. you eat a potato and your starving again in minutes, I took count, you need to eat 22 potatoes & beets a day cycle for 1 person or you DIE!  and funny thing is a human being in the real world can go 3 days without food, and even in drastic conditions a couple potatoes a day or even 2 fish should sustain someone, their water consumption might be tough but more on point than the food option. Sharks are cool but the weapons cost you spend to defend is a waste as the weapons do nothing to the shark, so don't bother. it is cheaper to let the shark eat a section of raft and rebuild it. if your storage is full and you don't realize it, you will toss your recently crafted item into the ocean for the sharks. I never played the free demo, but was really anticipating a fun building & crafting game similar to 7 days to die, but on the water. And it fell way short of that. It is so completely repetitive that it actually made me bored. if all you want to do is fish, grab items, rebuild raft, eat and drink. that is your life in Raft. when you play alone it is a bit more tricky as you have to try and do everything all at once and you will run out of raft pieces before you get very stable. When you die you lose everything including your hook and have half or less of life, food and water. Which leads to you dying even quicker the next time. At this point I am not sure I will give it much time in the future, until it has been improved. definitely needs work and debugging. So I do not recommend it at this time.
Fa♀ Q	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/saxvai012010/	Very nice to play with friends.
naet17	Recommended	70.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073385789/	So far I love this game. It gripped me in a bit of an obsession for a while, where I wanted to play it nearly all the time! I love the concept and hope with time it expands to include alot more to increase playability/replayability. There are a few things that can be a little annoying, such as rarely getting any respite away from the endless parade of sharks trying to eat you and your raft. Most of the time its a minor thing, but when the 'shark bait' you've created only holds his attention for about 90 seconds, and you have a whole load of resources underwater you want to harvest, it becomes a bit more irritating. That said, it has the potential to become an amazing game. As many people have said, it would be nice to have a variety of different things that can interact with you and your raft rather than just the shark (Eventually you run out of names for all the sharks heads you stick on your walls!) such as other sea creatures (Krakens, whales etc) bigger islands with more to explore (maybe with other animals?) and perhaps even weather issues that can damage your raft which you have to maintain.I like the idea of the search for Utopia, and perhaps you could encounter other NPC lost souls like yourself, who can join your crew and you can assign tasks to (Fishing, maintenance, farming etc), though the fact that it has a co-op is also a big plus.I really want to see more in the future for this game. I love that it's one of the few survival games out there which doesnt involve blasting Zombies or mutants, and it focuses mainly on building and surviving which is the personally the part that I love the most. Please Redbeet Interactive, give us more! :)

I have watched numerous videos about this and I am glad it is finally out! The whole dynamic of the game is original and being able to play with friends is even better. The layout of the game is great and the graphics remind me of rust (which is also a great game). From going onto islands and finding crafting materials, to killing a shark in the open ocean with a spear, I highly recommend this game to everybody and I can't wait to see what's to come in the future updates!
Lucky7s	Not Recommended	31.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lucky7s07/	Right now I cannot recommend this game - even though I had a lot of fun in the less than 18 hours it took me to beat the game.

I thought there were only few things to do, it is still in early access and many early access games have disappointed me. After playing it for awhile, I realize that this is a gem waiting to be polished and of course I look forward to it. If you like survival - management games then this is for you. It is really fun especially with friends (use em as shark baits - saves you fish and ropes :))

Zeffy	Not Recommended	15.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/exanis/	What would I say... First of all, please, remember when you read this review that I AM WRITING THIS DURING THE EARLY ACCESS.Let's start with the good points. As far as survival games goes, Raft have a lot of good things to offer. Gameplay is quite good, and if you played a few survival game before, you won't need to learn a lot. Some resources may be a bit hard to find, but you'll be able to cross this bridge easily. On the graphic part, the game have a very distinct universe, and it's quite good to see. The music do remind a lot minecraft's one, and feel totally adapted to this kind of game, so that's a good point too.Unlike some of the biggest names of survival like Ark or 7 days to die, there is no manually painted map for you to explore. Every game is a new map, with new islands to discover. You also have strictly nothing to see on the sea to help you know where you are going, so you will do a lot of your travels praying luck to show you the way. It add a very deep and immersive feeling to the game : you have no idea of where you are, nor where you should go.This immersion is improved by the wonderful onceanographic engine of the game. You certainly feel the sea changing with the weather, and given that you will *always* be on your raft, that's great. Seriously, all that I was hoping for is there, and that's great.Finally, you can really create your very own modular ship - it's not some kind of pre-build thing like in some other game. That's also something great - survival game is a lot about crafting, and this is done here.But then, why doesn't I recommanded it ? Why, good question, you brilliant fellow ! Actually, there are a few little "bad" point in the game. Let's start with the "Ok, this will probably stay and it's not a good news" ones.The first bad thing is this stupid shark. The shark is always near you, and trying to eat you (like, you know, a shark). And when you're in the sea, well, that's great ! That's a great addition and it makes going under sea dangerous and all, and that's what we expect. But the shark have another function : once every so often, it goes and start eating your boat (seriously ?), and if you don't react fast enough, a little piece of your raft is gone. And that part is bad. First of all, it's annoying ; we're doing something else, and suddenly we have to rush to save our ship. It also require you to play with the sound on, as you have strictly no other way to know that the shark is attacking - being disabled, the sound is sometime a huge problem for me, especially since I cannot have the game sound and still hear my friends on Discord, so it's either the game or multiplayer. And the worst part is that after two or three time, you count and discover that even if you manage to turn away the shark, as long as you keep a 1-line passing by around your raft, it's actually the same price (not including plastic, but... that's too easy to get) to let the shark eat what it want and rebuild after that - and you don't have to stop everything and run.Another thing that did annoy me is a small thing, but it was really disappointing : it's fishing. I mean, it's a sea-themed game, there are fish everywhere, so fishing must be a huge part of it ? Answer : no. Don't take me wrong, fishing IS an important part of the game. Except it basically sum up to "left click, wait, left click". No mini-game, nothing. I used to read a book while waiting for fish to catch - especially since a very important object can only use 2 out of the maybe 5 ou 6 different fish of the game, for a reason that I currently ignore...But those two things would not mean "no" for this game, as it's quite small. Sure, I could add that there is a lot of farming involved, but let's be honest : in a survival game, there is ALWAYS a lot of farming involved - and that's the part I love the most.So, why did I say no ? Well, a very important part of any survival game is the amount of things you can do, and that's where Raft fall short. Please remember, I'm writing this DURING THE EARLY ACCESS, so it may have changed when you buy and test it - but as for now, it took me a few hours to learn how the game worked, then after mayber 5 or 6 hours in a new world I had learned every single recipe in the recipe book, and created them all. The list is short, and although there is a real use behind every single element, I feel that after 14h of playing, i've "beat the game".Sure, I didn't test multiplayer... the thing is, as it is, I don't feel like making my friends by the game. I do like to test early access - they doesn't. And right now, the game is way to empty to be more than what would have been a demo a few years back - a pretty good demo, mind me, but still a demo.Does this mean you shouldn't buy the game ? Well... it's up to you. If you like to test a game, to see it change, to see new things go in, then by all means, go for it. There is nothing really wrong with the game as it is, and it's fun to play. Just keep in mind that it's short-played, but that it will grow - and when it will, then you will be glad to have it. Now, if you want a game that you will play countless hours and that have a lot to discover... wait a bit. Come back in a few month, and it will be the perfect game for you.

m3n1ce	Not Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198033199106/	the way the game is right now i would not reccomend it. the reason for this is there is just not enough content.the content that is available right now is promising but, it took me a small 4 hours to get through most of the game.i researched all the reciped build everything unique i could and got to the platform.i was playing the game on normal and the sharks are a joke and this is the only resistance you get in this game.all in all i think in a year or 2 this game could get good just like subnautica. its just that the same as with subnautica just not enough content on the early access.and on another note i dont like it when developers published half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥games and just put it under early access and still charge full price.i kinda regret playing it more than 2 hours right now because i cant refund it anymore.when this game gets more content and actually some challenge i will change my review because i think the game has real potential

sweggy	Recommended	17.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198261633726/	I like the game, it's so challenging about a survival genre, it's scary, funny when you get to kill the bird and the shark! I really like that the game is still on Early Access, what I want in this game is you could make the islands a bit bigger and you could build bases there and make a community and it will be more facinating if you add animals in those islands, and humans like a survivor trapped in an island. You could make a community in the island with friends and I'm hoping for a story mode for single and multiplayer so you could play story mode with your friends or by yourself. Anyways great game! I love that you could build and survive from threats like birds and sharks, I like the idea of that! Keep working on this game it's really worth your time :)

Dragon	Recommended	28.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ganjalfthegreen1/	Day 1 - I'm on a raft in the middle of nowhere. Only thing I have is a hook and the 4 planks I have under me.Ocean is polluted as ♥♥♥♥, but I've found some potatoes in a floating barrel.I can see a shark that is looking me with this kind of hungry look.Day 2 - I can see a small island passing near me, but I've got nothing to stop the boat or make it change its direction.I made a water purifier, and a grill. Grilled potatoes and beetroots are pretty bland without seasonning, but at least my stomach doesn't bother me anymore.I made my raft a little bigger, even though the shark had eaten a part of it.Day 3 - This ♥♥♥♥er will no longer bother me. I've got a spear now ! I started fishing too, but for now the only I've got was... a boot.I'm thinking of making an anchor.Day 4 - Thanks to seagulls, I have now meat to eat. Made a crop plot. Well, now I've got no more potatoes, but well...Also made some stairs. and started to build a roof over my head.I've looted metal and hinge. One bolt too. It was on some dirty construction.... can't say where exactly. We're on the ocean, I suppose. Don't know exactly.Day 5 - Finally ! Finally !!I've killed the shark !Made some delicious steak.I started to plan a trophy room.Make the first trophy. Because I'm alone here, I think it may be a good buddy. I've called this one "Sashimi".Another appear a few moments later. Is it the land of infinite sharks ?Day 50 - I'm now the master of the sea. I've got plentyfull of resources. Sashimi got news friends, called Fish head, "not fast enough", "wood eater", etc...I've explorated the seaworld to the underneath darkness. I've looted an incredible number of islands.The shark is now my favourite prey, since it gives a lot of food.I make barbecues on the 8th floor of my tower (the highest). And I fish from there.My raft is now really big also.There's nets all around it, so I can sleep all day and end being rich anyway. Most of my storages are full, and the others are near full too.I only miss alcohol and Wilson.There's just that bird and that cat with his moving hand. But it's not the same as talking to a human faced ball.15/2 would kill the shark again.

Twerking Potato	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/twerkingpotato4/	 Review So far in my 9 hours of gameplay, I've been playing on hard difficulty. I've found it not really challenging, Although the game is still in early access I haven't seen any bugs really (except the shark can swim through rocks). Also so far not a really long story line, unless there is more to it then just finding the white board so far. There are some coordinates but I'm not sure how to use them at this stage in time. All in all this game so far is still about a 6/10, still plenty more work to do on the game, but I'd wait till the game is on sale to purchase. 
caffine1	Recommended	18.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001091215/	I would call this a good game. Finished in 13 hours over two days (in 2 play sessions), both of which with 2 friends.Your enemy: Entropy. Just getting settled in? SHARK. Got him beat? Mind your air! Got your diving down pat? Time for food! Got all that done? Well that nice spear just broke and your fishing pole is on its last legs and you are out of rope. Time to keep moving.Pros:1: The game is smooth to play and a joy visually. While not photo-realistic, the aesthetic is very nice.2: Build paths are fairly straightforward, but with a bit of grind. Nothing horrible, just the realities of survival games.3: Very smooth building system! Everything foundation-wise snaps together nicely. Furniture is nicely designed and places easily.Cons:1: The problem inherent with all survival games, you reach a certain point and things become easier. (although this is mitigated by the requirement to keep moving to get more resources)2: Your primary enemy gets old after a while (especially after metal is aquired). This is also mitigated by resource scarcity and the durability system, but still a thing3: Island climbing. Its a pain, mainly due to no portable ladders or climbing ropes (may be fixed in future releases). Every island is a jumping puzzle that sometimes doesnt reach the top.Overall: Even in early access (with much hope for future additions) a decent buy for solo play at current prices (20USD June 18, 2018). A good buy for play with a few friends.
BuckleBD	Recommended	23.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rinascita/	A little bare bones right now, but very enjoyable regardless. I'm having a great time with friends sailing and building our ever growing raft. I can't wait to see what else is added. I'd especially love more threats.
SaberXZ	Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099351577/	Overall it's a good game, especially when you play with a friend and then die because you've made some stupid mistake (Yeah, we make fun from our friends' stupidity).The cruising, surviving in the early stage are quite interesting, gathering materials and farming from an island are also quite interesting. But after few hours delving into the system and understand the system, the game start to get repetitive. Most people compare this game to Minecraft, but I would like to compare this game to Don't Starve.The mechanics in Minecraft, Don't Starve and Raft is that your character has survival bars which warn you what resource you have to fetch afterwards. However, Minecraft is on the extreme end of creativity while Don't Starve is on the extreme end of survival (What is that? Is that a gigantic tentacle that looks like it can be made into a huge Takoyaki? [You Died]).Raft lies in the middle, it provides you with a limited amount of creativity (building your own raft), but it also gives you a challenge (?). However, the challenge only remains as challenge in the first 1 hour of the game, once you have enough resources to have the luxury of making weapons, the challenge (shark) becomes the moth in your bedroom that always smashes into you face and disturbs your sleep.As a early access game, this game still have potential and opportunity to change direction. And I think what this game need is the depth of Don't Starve. The lack of enemies, limited number of surprises on the sea and the lack of varieties in resources have put a boundary to the end-game content, once you've made your raft become a fortress, this game becomes a age-caring-and-sea-admiring holiday trip game. Developers ought to add in new enemies or even systems to alleviate the boredom in end-game.There are some suggestions:- Furious Weather (Tornado, Tsunami, blizzard or even sun-bake. This requries the sea to be divided into several random regions.)- Varieties of sea creatures (When you dive into the water, you can see creatures other than that annoying shark, maybe dolphins, jellyfish, starfish, whales, etc.)- Many dangers out there + a room for imaginery fantasy (Pirates that will rob your raft, sunken loot box, a kraken, Umibosu [Japanese sea demon] and even one piece(x))- More islands (Islands in this game only provides resources, which is quite repetitive. Maybe the developers should add enemies on the island like skeletons, apes, ghosts or even donkey kong(x). Also, the developers can add bigger Islands(El Dorado) that allow the players to explore the island + find the treasures on the islands. Most importantly, is to add different designs of Islands: snowy islands, rocky islands, tropical islands etc.)I can see the potential of this game, and lots of features that can be added into this game. I understand that some contents require further financial support, so DLCs may be a viable solution (but only within a reasonable price).Overall: 3/5.
CHAT OFF (I got it!)	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/arasftw/	The game is great and has lots of potential. The developers are actually listening to their community, and the community itself is really friendly and helpful. Would recommend the game to everyone who wants solo/multiplayer survival adventures and wants to grind their way to the top.
IntrepidH	Recommended	19.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007262411/	Good game! if they add more dynamic events that can happen as you cross the ocean this will be a great game. (same with new building options)
♥Ján♥	Recommended	124.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/janjancimelich/	It's a good game, it has potential. But more content would be better, but it's still playable and enjoyable especially with friends (about 40h then it's just boring (for me of course)). Achievement Survive 365 days is pain in the ♡♡♡, you have to play more then 100h in one world, so i'm mostly afk listening to music or watching movies (just sometimes alt+tab to the game to eat and drink to not die and farm days) to get that achievement. :)
Operation40	Recommended	86.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960952974/	Without very much content at all, this game has easily become my favorite in the genre.  It "fixes" one of the main issues with these games -- you normally set up a base somewhere and then venture out in an ever expanding circle to gather resources.. ie: the grindHere your base is your means of travel.   You're collecting resources, crafting, cooking/eating/drinking, and base building -- all while traveling.  I really can't go back to any another surivival game now.. The thought of running back and forth from a base endlessly is just mind-numbingly boring.
sennyk4 rustypot.com	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/S4LChance313/	This game has so much potential I enjoy it alot but I feel like it lacks content for the type of game it is. Its really fun right nowbut so many things could be added to it to improve the game.-Harbors; more things to run into in the water-wider variety of islands; all islands pretty much offer the same thing, maybe add some boss islands or treasure island-Maybe add some ancient aspect to this game like atlantis or something-Add more to explore underwater and add a larger variety of materials underwater-Make fish visible and be able to swim around and spear fish as an alternative to fishing-Add different weapons like a harpoon gun or a flair gun you can find which will signal a helecopter that atteps to rescue you but crashes or drops food and materials for you-Add more variety in PVE; just sharks will get boring really fast, maybe add dolphins, whales, ect.-Add bigger and more random shipwrecks floating around.-Make the loot on shipwrecks and islands harder to get to-Add more types of buildins ex.(wood, leaves)-Make hidden loot above and inside islands -Add underwater volcanoes that make larger above water volcanoes over timeSo much more could be added then what I just put 
Mar	Recommended	24.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarMarie/	Quick review about this game! :)▸ Pros: - The game is very easy to understand. It does have it's complexity, but it's easy to get into.- Enough content for an early access game (Not enough for a full release though)- Game works smoothly, didn't have any FPS/Lag issues.- The graphics are very nice, I enjoyed them. :)▸ Cons:- There are sadly some issues in the multiplayer. If you disconnect, it happens that your inventory is gone. I wish it would recognize players individually, so their stuff doesn't get lost. - I have only played for 7 hours so far, but I'm sure this isn't a game that you can play for a long time, after some time there's just everything done. I wish there would be big Islands, like, super big islands that would take a long time to explore, this would be very time consuming for the player, but you'll be very curious about the island.- More character customization! If you'd be able to craft clothes and accessories that would be great!I do recommend this game because it's so much fun to play :) 
Trustor	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trustorgaming/	Amazing and fun game, for a while.... When you reach the "end" and you've done everything, it kind of loses re-playability.

[Jurassic Gojira』	Recommended	49.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_real_godzilla/	This game is awesome. For a player like me who is really into adventure and Co-op games, this is recommended for you. There are some pros and some cons though.Pros:-Creativity can be expressed here. (creative)-Perfect for survival game lovers. (survival)-Great entertainment-Can build many different things (creative)-Creative is unlimited-You can never get tired fast.Cons:-In survival, freaking sharks attack every 2 minutes-Seagulls can be pests when it comes to crop plots.-Limited suplies (survival)Overall Rating: 8/10
ThePeskyAce	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThePeskyAce/	Really love this game! So much fun! I really love crafting survival games, but my only issue with this game is you can beat it in 10 -15 hours. After that there's not much to do. You've crafted everything and all you can really do is kill the shark and swim underwater and scavenge but that gets old pretty fast.BUT.. I still recommend this game, its just really short at the time being. Can't wait for future updates!

GlassO'Brandy	Recommended	10.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198238225306/	"This hooking s**t is worth $20 alone." - One of the people I was playing Raft withI'm a person who is fond of survival games; when a few of your friends have the game as well, it's a great bonus. 3 of my friends bought the game (so then I jumped in), and we loved it. This is all we really played for 3 days. However, it felt like there was something missing after a while and it felt to simple. We "beat" the game in 6 hours and haven't done much with the game sense. Overall, Raft is a game you should purchase and you will get a few hours of fun out of it. I'm curious where the developers go with the game; hopefully, they make it more of a challenge (Ex: add more enemies like AI Pirates and an octopus). 7/10, S**T I FELL IN THE OCEAN.

BluePrince21	Recommended	26.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051567522/	Have you ever wanted to be out on a raft in the middle of a never-ending ocean, fishing for scraps and hoping a shark doesn't kill you while you sleep?I didn't either, but it's too fun not to try.Before the release of this game on early access, I got the pleasure to play back when it was an itch.io creation.  Free, and wanting of content, the game was too good to be true, and sought to redefine what it means to survive.  Did it get there?  No, but that's the point of playtesting on a free platform.  Now, it's on EA and doing very well.  I recommend this to a gamer who is sick of playing in a forest, on an island, or in a nuclear wasteland (I know who I'm mentioning).  Get this game and get eaten or starve with friends!!!

On the first hour of gameplay it may get boring but as soon as you expand your raft and build, learn stuff, the game levels up that level of "fun". I suggest play with some friends, choose hard mode and enjoy beeing shark food and dying of hunger and thirst <3 
하나님	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cayvx/	This game is grreat but don't get me wrong this game has a lot of flaws such as being able to be beaten in under 3 hours and being such a quick game I will probably re-buy this game if such elements as Online Multiplayer are added for more player interaction which will for sure promote more popularity among this game not much to be said but this game is good but it is fast and if you are looking for a game that you are probably going to be playing 3-5 times I would recommend this game but if you are looking for a game that is never ending this is not the game for you.Mixed Feelings about this game but overall was a fun experience.

KosmykTrigger	Recommended	51.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997270493/	Raft is an amazing take on the survival genre and reminds me of Minecraft (in the best of ways!).

If you have never played a survival game, this is the best game to begin with!

FireBeard	Not Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fire3eard/	There's not much to say about to say this game. Good concept but the execution so far is nothing amazing. You have a vast ocean that's filled with little to nothing, above and below the water. You gather resources to build up your raft. All in all your playthrough of this game is finished in 6 - 8 hours. I don't want to spoil the end game for you but yeah it's lacklustre. I wasn't moved. I understand it's early access but there's simply no content here yet to justify the price. If it was less than $7 I could potentially recommend it, but there's really not much to see here. I hope they build to improve it and flesh out the game.

Since its just only 300 mb to download and there is this much content into the game and decent graphics i think you should give it a try especially if you are into survival games.
noof	Not Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198325213869/	This game is really good and enjoyable, and you may be question my negative review.The game is fun in the beginning portion, trying to survive, struggling with the shark attacking your small raft every few minutes and keeping me entertained.But after a good 5 hours into the game, it gets boring and stale.There isn't much to do after that point, and it gets repetitive.I would recommend this game in the later future with more updates, and maybe more Sea Creatures that could attack your raft. (Kraken, Megalodon, etc.)So, if you want the game now, I insist you wait until more updates and use that $20 for something else.

Papa Kool-Aid	Not Recommended	2.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096691750/	I think that this game is garbage. the game seems like your avrage survival crafting game with its own twist, and its an intresting idea on paper but at the end of the day its still bad 98% of the game is grinding in the worst way possible, all you do is sit in one spot and throw a hook at passing garbage... with the same moddels... the same thing... the entire time. whats that other 2% you may ask, well the other 2 percent is the mild satisfaction you get when you finally against all odds find what you were looking for to build a thing so that you can then use that thing to help you grind again and its an endless cycle and not the good kind like other survival games. being on the raft is a cool idea but again on paper it sounds good but its still not because theres no expance to explore sure you can build out the ship but once you get it to a decent size theres never a reason to expand again. you will occasionaly come across a small island with soem things on it but the island is no wider than the decent size i mentiond for your ship and you may also come across another raft that when you hop on will start sinking you grab the one supply box on it and its never seen again untill you come across another raft that does the same thing. point is this game is very boring and not worth 20 bucks. maybe it will be in the future and i get this is an early access game but in its current state i'd say its worth about 5 bucks.P.S. I did not forget about the sharks they are just as boring as the abandoned raft and the island you build up to kill it and then another one comes you achive nothing but getting a useless shark head and some meat.Fin
Droek	Not Recommended	0.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Droek_/	Played for 40 minutes and then a shark ate on of my pieces and the whole raft sank. Couldnt reload it or anything without it being underwater, tried creating a new world and the raft instantly sank when I spawned. Deleted my saves and everything but when I load a new world I instantly sink. Maybe one day this will turn into something fun but $20 is too steep to sit on an unplayable game. Refunded.
Deivis	Not Recommended	16.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038233544/	Super simplistic game, you drift in the ocean, collect floating resources, upgrade your raft, occasionally loot the island or another raft, in the end find platform, that's it. Around 5 hours of content in a duo coop (including roleplaying) so there is even less content than 5 hours. For the price it is asking, it's way too low, so if you aren't into the decorating and painting of your raft, do not buy it, wait for more content, especially if it gets abandoned like most of the early access games do.

Pros: It could be a good game in a few months or next year.Cons : nothing to do once you have a raft built.Its very repetitive your tools brake so fast you run out of food so fast etc etc.You find an island you can not build on the island lol Nothing to do in the game after a few hours. 
Pie Master	Recommended	20.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/foxraidr/	Really great game to spend with your friends, solo just feels so lonely ;( For the hours I speant on it I enjoyed every bit of it. Graphics are nice, the shark can be a deek which puts edge on you if you fall off your raft, the crafting elements is wonderfully executed. I have technically finished this game, crafting everything you can finding a certain area.... the only thing I'd like is more craftables, maybe more danger? The one shark wasn't that bad to be honest, only attacking every 5 minutes and taking 1 piece off my raft if i missed the chance defending. Maybe add diferent types of sharks? enemies? Possibly in the future the game will branch out into something like an open world where theres pvp. I thought it was odd the game had a friendly fire option when ur gonna just play with friends, unless theyre gonna be bastids than yeah I can understand. Overall tho I say get the game it's really well made for an early acess game, and supporting the developer can help them push out more updates faster.
#FREELLAMA	Not Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FREESHALEV/	This game is fun especilly with friends but if you are you are playing about  5 hours you will finish the game and it will be very boring and thats not worth the money
Tricky	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Truckydurr/	I tried to like the game. At first it was refreshing but as soon i progressed i found myself in constant harrasing of the shark. As soon you start there is a shark that WILL destroy your boat eventually, so you need to gather resources as soon you can. Even in the night so i feel that defeats the point of crafting and appreciate the nice aspects of the game, the night with the big waves was so immersive but i felt in constant harrass of the shark it wasn't fun. I think they should fix this omnigod shark. Sorry for the review hope something can be done about it.
illuminati Cat	Recommended	41.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/illuminatiCatYT/	I think the game is realy fun, its greate to play with friends and alone. me and my friend just "finished" the game. i won't spoil anything for anyone. i think for $20 its worth, couse think about this when its is fully released it will prob be $30-$40. i would give the game 7/10 at this stage in the game development.So over all the game is worth buying at this point. if you dont like games like this i would suggest to look somewhere els.

Jack4Lope	Not Recommended	22.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jack4Lope/	It's a pretty bland game, the main enemy is over used and bceomes really predictable, momentary events of excitement also become really mundane at worst being a nuisance to development. You are really just waiting for things to float into your raft, collect them, store them, expand... So the game doesn't really develop anywhere, it's a raft building game, it's barely a survival game except for the first few hours when you maybe don't realize what you have to do to keep up your draining stats. However once you become fearless of the shark, or you decide to do the more arduous farming, and once you figure a better water purification system, it's just not a thing to worry about anymore.So the shark being the one other constant in the game, could do with a little personality, maybe be a little less predictably evil and menacing behaviour. Sharks are far more interesting when you don't know exactly what they will do. It would be great if it wasn't there, ALWAYS, or if it was, it wasn't 100% of the time going after you once it gets within a certain distance after which is will always come back. Rather, would develop as a threat if you kept doing something, like injuring yourself in the water, splashing arround on a makeshift paddle board. Fish a lot for sustenance, or spend a lot of time under water. If all you are doing is farming potatoes on a boat, relaxing in the sun, it's just annoying that the shark keeps attacking your boat. Sure you could playcreative, but again this is just to illustrate that this game is a constant bland stream of content and upkeep. Hats off to you if this is what you want, there is comfort in repetition and prep, this game has plenty of it. I just got a job so, got that quota filled. Progression is convoluted, mostly just "Hey did I do this? Yep, what abouit this?" as you look in the research book for things to click research on. It just doesn't feel like proper development and you are done with it pretty quick. It would be fantastic if this was some kinda game that required time, al lthe while that f'ing shark is chewing at your raft. The tommorrow children had a great slider puzzle system, that took either skill or time, something like that to make it a little more involved. Crafting feels very forced, with everything wearing down. I'm surprised the sail doesn't just wilt before my eyes, clearly the most valueable thing in the game. Resources are also just too random, untill you start farming, yey. Then it's just a calcuilated trade of scrap metal (Really important) into wood (get a ton of this, from floating around) The game should be called Floaty Farm with the ammount you'll be doing that. Just research collection nets, make as wide a raft as possible, basically a big circle and just wherever you go you're in the loot.Otherwise as said above the game is just a constant flow, it keeps going, nothing ever happens. Untill you build everything and you get a nominal payoff from playing the game for roughly 10 hours, after which it just returns to the same game with one extra thing you can do to make farming (collecting) stuff easier. It's like a cookie clicker with a hunger and thirst system that threatens to end your game before you want it to really. It's portrayed as a chill experience but does its best to just annoy you with little things constantly, while you're trying to get to that zen moment of not needing anything more, guess that's the end game. It comes arround eventually, once you make the choice to just farm materials for a few hours, you'll have enouigh to just quit, build as impressive a raft as you want. I've played maybe 13 hours (I spent a lot of time in the menu, having left the game on over night once or twice)It could use a bit more polish, especially in the sound department, it's mostly just a collection of white noise looping, doesn't really bring out the feeling of being on the ocean. Music is awkward, pseudo Minecraft kind of stuff, first thing to do in game is to turn it off. The game starts off with a huge musical score for no aparent reason, get hyped for waiting for trash to float by you, wooh! Music should be there to focus and draw your attention to the little details, not just randomly played for the sake of having it.The gameplay could do with a little polish as well, it's very stunted, and jerky feeling. Things feel delayed, slow, and badly paced. Even being in the water is awkward, basic swim up and down controls would be good, but right now you only go forwards and backwards and up. For some reason the developer decided to add in space controls, so you can turn the world upside down if you look down far enough, but when that happens left and right are reversed so... Vomit warning? It would be really cool if the game properly simulated the sensation of being in a moving fluid, but that's maybe asking a little too much consdering the hook physics are as basic as they are.You'll be sure to go over your 2 hour trial so really consider what you do in the first hour, as that's the game for the next 13 hours too! Here's hoping my 20$ goes to developing the game further, but right now it's just not worth it. Now many people would say, "You got 13 hours of gameplkay out of this game, how is that not enough for 20$?" and I'll say, that was more like 10 hours of work, and lets give a generous 3 hours of wonder and actual excitement to the different keystones of the game. And it is work, it's not enjoyable. You are kept away from even looking at the game, islands pass you by as you try to figure out a better way to sort your stuff out. The game really needs a bit of adversity. Storms are things that should be avoided, navigation should be eventually possible (In a sense it is, with the radar, however this is just a way to reliably find islands in a sense, abit more creative though.) What I'm really hoping this game does is eventually make a larger explorable location and I'm guessing that's their plan. It would really be nice if you could explore a larger space before leaving and starting the "travel float" to find a new such location. The game also needs more variety in terms of enemies. Finding eels when collecting scrap on the side of islands, jellyfish schools drifting arround, maybe even predator birds that you need to hunt down. That shark needs to take a chill pill, maybe have more of them though, a little variety maybe even entire schools of sharks to make it so you defineatly don't want to make the mistake of catching their attention. It would be great if your actions, like trapping fish for too long in collection nets is what triggered the shark to attack your raft rather then it being a timer based eventuallity. Storms and being next to islands while they happen should be among the most dangerous events, if you see/hear a storm coming, you just go. Being in a storm , you'd want to hunker in, the waves could wash you off. Would mean you'd want to build a home more then a sea trash collection rig. If the game had these systems in such a balance that you could loose your raft, compeltely but survive with a makeshift flotation device/vest and find yourself on an island or something to start again would be great. Once you have a set of tools, all the research done, you kind of want to start again.Anyway, that's a long rant. I really want this game to be more survival, less Raft... Not quite the same level as Subnautica, even 2 years ago, but it's got a glint of something in it's eyes. I guess once twitch streamers that normally don't play these kinda games start playing this game, pay attention, but otherwise, maybe if it's priced down to 10$ or less get it. 10 or so hours of gameplay pretty much assured, it has multiplayer too. Didn't try that though.
Foxy	Recommended	6.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/charliebluefox/	Great game, but can get boring quickly. Can't wait for new content though.

A Brussel Sprout	Not Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259158180/	At first glance, Raft seems like a fresh take on the survival genre. The vast ocean and slow progression from makeshift raft to fully-equipped survival cruiser provide a unique and in-depth first experience. But, like so many other survival games, it fails to maintain a long-lasting replay experience. First and foremost, the endless, procedurally generated ocean (although a unique environment for a survival game) is quite empty and far from stimulating. Even the islands and abandoned rafts, the only notable parts of the water, are nothing more than overglorified resource nodes. They fail to make any real mark in memory other than giving the player a few neat resources that allow them to progress.As with so many other survival games, Raft's moment-to-moment gameplay consists of mundane and repetitive tasks that are periodically disrupted by events, some helpful and some detrimental. In Raft, however, there are few events which truly challenge the player or demand a redical change in gameplay. There are no massive storms that threaten to tear your raft apart or exceptionally rare encounters with danger and loot. Rather, there are simple and mundane events like the occasional shark attack and a small, mostly empty raft off in the distance. The shark attack - intended to be a feared peril - has no real consequence besides losing a piece of your raft which costs next to nothing to replace. The abandoned raft, likewise, can be ignored without any consequence as its loot is just more of the same stuff you can find elsewhere.While Raft is certainly an interesting title for the first few hours, I cannot see many sticking aroudn for longer than the first impression. The replay value is extremely limited; once you have seen it once, you've seen it all. I understand that Raft is an early access title, but I don't feel that small content additions can solve its issues. No amount of cool new items or encounters can solve the fact that the core gameplay (eat, drink, repeat) wears off a bit too fast to justify a $20 price tag.

Locodemotive	Not Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Locodemotive/	If your on the fence about getting this game, I would advise you not too. Now the game is in early access but the content of the game can be easily done in 8 hours and even less if you don't spend 30 minutes chasing the shark around in the water in a revenge frenzy for taking off a piece of your raft, though this issue might be more unique to me. Nether the less though for $20 even in early access is a price that in my opinion is too steep for the content currently available especially when you compare it what they had on Itch.io a while back. I would be remiss if I did not mention though short, everything I've done and experienced has been quite fun and enjoyable.Now I will say I'm waiting patiently for each update to come out and will update this when they have worked on and released some updates or when the game fully releases, but until then I cannot recommend this.
herr tugendbold	Not Recommended	1.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsharby/	game just simply isn't worth $20, but why?was kinda excited for this, but at a glance now, this version of the game is virtually no different (apart from intefaces/few animations) than the same version I played in alpha over a year ago- and that was freeSeems like you've really tried, but i'm not feeling it, especially since the games baseline replay value is pretty much nil as you're relying on having friends who are willing you drop 20 bucks on a game that's barely even taking it's babiest steps after 1-2+ years of "dedicated development", and don't even bring up matchmaking to me in a game like this, that's just a recipe for disaster with people griefing your builds, dropping items and wasting your timetry again next time, or lower the price to suit the games realistic genre: casual/co-op 
Wicked Jester	Not Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040810586/	So I played the Alpha build of this game, and it was surprisingly stable. Following the full release of the game, everything is much nicer looking, and mechanics have been refined. Islands are nice, when they're not three stories tall and therefore impossible to climb onto unless your raft is somehow both tall and agile enough to anchor nearby. i've got about six hours played thus far, and have already run into an issue where the game completely locks up, seemingly for no reason, causing me to force quit. The other issue occurs when the camera stops responding, so I can no longer turn to face different directions, making it pretty much impossible to keep playing normally. I like that you can now dive under water, but with how long it takes to kill the shark, how crappy shark bait is, and how quickly the shark respawns, it might as well be an unused mechanic. Having played on both Easy and Normal, I can say that Easy is still very challenging, or should I say frantic? It is a constant grind to keep food and water up, such that I am missing crucial supplies as I rush to and fro, watering plants and catching fish to keep from dying for the next two or three minutes. Speaking of supplies, the crafting recipes are so expensive, and gathering bulk supplies is so tedious, that I found myself forgoing anything beyond the basix necessities for survival. The Research table was a luxury I found myself avoiding after I built it, as my most basic materials went into the constant mainenance of my raft and replacement of the tools I so desperately needed in order to keep myself fed. Overall, a disappointing experience, one I found myself sighing and groaning over time and time again. Definitely not worth the 20 dollars I spent to play this as soon as it came out.
Eri	Recommended	28.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198250817198/	This game is 10/10 in my opinion.Me and my friends finished the game so far, but we are still playing it because it's not boring, grinding never stops.So far it is in Early Access so the game is not yet complete. Expect more updates because this game has pretty good devs.So let's proceed with its PROS and CONS.PROS:- Early Access but you can do tons of stuffs with your friends (unlike other games out there)- The game is challenging, i recommend everyone to play it in hard mode if you have friends with you. We really enjoyed it.- When you're with your friends you can get specific roles like someone in charge of cooking, sailing, diving and island hopping. Role playing is really fun!- Griding is not boring, you can really craft good stuffs and the amount you need is not that high or low.- There is a cool backstory in this game, i'm sure people will love creating theories about it.(just check it out)- Everything in this game has it's own purpose- Controls are really good- People can express their creativity in their raft.- After many hours of grinding you should see something awesome. (just check it out)- Suprisingly Chilling even tho it's a survival game.- Graphics = really good especially when the sun rises in the morning- low specs needed, really optimized and will improve sooner i guess- This game is worth the price, and it's pretty cheap tbh. (it's indie)CONS:(I HATE TO SAY THE CONS IN THIS GAME BUT PEOPLE SHOULD KNOW THIS BEFORE BUYING THIS EVEN THO I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH)- Sharks and seagulls (only creatures you can kill or if you include your friends)- Loading the game with the host might be hardTIPS: -If you have friends with you, the host should save the game always and be the first to exit the game.-if you got disconnected, the host should save the game and exit or else you will have no items left in your hands when you joined.(so that's all the cons i can think in this game tbh, the game is really good the only thing you should worry is the progress saving in this game.)This game is really good, solo players might think this game is boring, but i swear this game will not bore you in your first 5 hours gameplay. This game is CO-OP so its meant to be played with someone.That's all thank you for reading my review, sorry for the bad english I hope i helped alot.EDIT: IT'S NOVEMBER, 4 MONTHS AFTER I POSTED THIS REVIEW, THE DEVS ARE DOING THEIR BEST TO IMPROVE THE GAMEPLAY, THIS GAME IS REALLY IMMERSIVE!
Rosenthal	Not Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rosenthal92/	Devs keep on making giveaways of keys instead of actually adding content, they added a craftable axe, some trees and a fish school (which you can't do nothing with) in the span of six monthsBought the game on the release weekend and did everything in under 7 hours, dead game for now.
My Gangster => Rembo	Recommended	15.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198378249215/	Good game.
Amplitude Problem	Recommended	32.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/amplitudeproblem/	Nice twist on the survival genre. I have a wishlist for features but I fear adding them might kill what's great about this game.
MrStump	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrStump/	Played the free version and enjoyed it a lot. It felt like it boiled down a lot of the enjoyable bits of survival, removing boring thints like watching progress bars go as your chop trees or dig. Instead, the supplied just sort of roll near you and it is up to you to collect them. There was still a nice challenge as you tried to manage your meager supplies with your constant needs.This is a great extension of that, from what I have played. I feel like the origional was worth $10 on its own, and this feels like it is worth $20 right now. And there seems like there will be even more to come. Can't wait to see it.
RTG F3ARZ Twitch.tv	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WowIssaBIGman/	Raft is a very simple yet fun survival game. You are stranded in the ocean and you survive by building up your raft. The game is very new yet made pretty well. I have found few glitches, although when playing with friends it can be a bit laggy at times. The game needs a lot more though. While yes the game feels full and is entertaining it needs more things and item which will come with time. I am only writing this at update 1.01.
Mampf	Not Recommended	10.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198160544253/	Too less content for $20 and lots of bugs like friends out of sync. So everything is lost.Also mod support would be great.
tristris.	Not Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tristris/	You're stranded in an endless sea of garbage on a small raft. Scavenge enough garbages and you can expand your little raft to titanic proportion. Occassionally you get to see small uninteresting islands and abandoned rafts for you to loot. The sea is a lonely place. And that loneliness creeps up to you, as you realized you're building your raft all for nothing. No NPCs to keep you sane except an unrequited love of a shark that follows you everywhere you go. Rating: 2/5Verdict: Get it during sales or if you really like sharks.
KIA	Not Recommended	91.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198136007695/	I enjoyed the free version, and was hopeful for this, but the game has not really expanded too much to be worth the $20 price tag. Yes you can dive for ores and such and build a sail but it's still pretty much the same, With in one day, you have accomplished all you can do and have loot coming out your um yea that thing. Check my screen shots for a picture of my nets over flowing and I have only had the game 1 day had two large chests full and 4 small chests full of just building mats and had no need to expand anymore (no need for creative mode really).  I'd say at it's current state it's worth 10 to 15 max. I honestly don't know how they plan to expand this or what they can add to make it much more interesting but I guess time will tell. Fun game to kill time and come back to and start over once in a blue moon (I did that every now and then on the free version), but don't expect a lot of game play as there are very little difference in land and the random rafts, they are pretty much all the same, nothing new to explore. Sadly I just can't give this one a thumbs up at this time. But again it is a fun little game, just not for the current price tag.
暗闇フェニックス	Not Recommended	102.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059412832/	This is a peaceful and relaxing game.This game is enjoyable but gets boring after a while due to the lack of content.I recommend you to play this game with friends.A lack of content for its price tag.
hamdiggy	Not Recommended	9.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hamdiggy/	I understand this is early access. But I just spent 10 hours playing a world, and when I came back the next day, I was dropped into the middle of an empty ocean with no raft in site. That is a hard stop on suggesting this game to anyone else, if the save files are so incredibly corrupted.
..::GooBaLL60	Not Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gooball60/	I wanted to get into this game and really have some fun, but it's just not there yet. It could be a bit more fun with some friends, but things are just too boring by yourself. Give this game a year and it might be a lot better, but for now, save your 20 dollars.
E. Blanskiy	Not Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jagmeshwchc/	A game has lot of potential but without the contetn its very boring to play. You are doing the same things again and again. Game need something big as an update, like new generated islands or ships or smth like that. But for now its just a game for 4-5 hours, not more.

Me comeré a tus bebés	Not Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/notsnoj/	  Unless you have a couple of friends who have the game, it can get really boring- even if you are playing with friends. If there were more things to do in the game, it would be a lot more interesting.

Ser Slojanko - The Third	Not Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Slojanko/	The concept is great. You flow through the open ocean on four blocks and scavenge resources that come your way to turn that raft into a true sea-worthy vessel. It's the concept itself that compelled me to purchase this game. But the execution is why I refunded it with such little play time.From the start the repetitive nature of this game quickly sinks in. You spend a few minutes throwing a hook to get resources that are just out of grabbing reach. You then exchange plastic, plants or wood for something you need. Maybe another hook, maybe a water purification station. Then you repeat the process again. Hook the unrealistic amount of debris randomly flowing through the waters in your direction. Make something that might be useful, the shark attacks your boat. You fight it off, you scavenge some more. Maybe an Island appears. You hop on it to grab some free food and maybe a seed. You hop back on your boat.You repeat infinitely...The game had so much potential but for the most part this game is just you crouching and picking up debris that come your way, or using a hook to drag them in and using those resources to make something that might be useful in prolonging that gameplay loop.It's not fun... You can't even join public lobbies, only your friends games. I can see the potential. But in its current state its just... not fun.
MetalPotato	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Metal_Potato/	Early Access Review
EpicDignewt	Recommended	17.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049477546/	It feels like the original barebones demo, but with more detail. Which is good! I'm glad the original elements that drew me into the demo are still present in the updated version.Features I like (in no particular order):The planting system, there are a lot more things to grow.Fishing is cool, good variety of things to catch, plus some goodies.Islands! It's cool to stop by the islands to get things like palm seeds, scrap metal, etc. The trade-off is that you stop floating by the normal materials (like plastic, palm leaves, etc) which means you need to be careful about how long you stay. It keeps you moving, which is awesome!Large amount of items to craft, which means there's always something to upgrade/make as a quality of life change.Asthetics! You have more options for platforms, roofs, windows, doors, etc, you also have the option to paint anything you make if you make enough dyes.Personally, I'd love to see more stuff done with islands, more things you can float by, basically more events with more of a game impact. There could be more animals than the seagull and shark, as well.I'm definitely going to update this with any other thoughts I have about it, this is just my initial thoughts.

Atmos	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/joshmann97/	This game is super fun, even by yourself it is real fun. Yes, there isn't so much to do just yet but the survival is engaging and it you will have a FAT laugh if you play with friends. Kinda reminds me of minecraft skyblock.
A Purple Manatee	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/apurplemanatee42/	I bought this game a few days ago and I have been obsessed with the game. I had enjoyed the game Stranded Deep but was looking for something a little more casual and multiplayer, and thought this looked like a good alternative. Here are some pro's and con's of it thus far (as of writing this, it is still in Early Access Alpha here on Steam). Note that I'm only a casual fan of the "survival/crafting" genre of games like Minecraft. + Easy to understand crafting+ Art style; this ain't no Minecraft cube stuff+ Various levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Creative+ Multiplayer; I think this game is probably most fun with friends but not absolutely needed like in Rust+ Small download - 250 MB+ Rewarding crafting - being able to survive "easier" as you go along- Content - as it is EAA there COULD be much more, and there should be more to come. Needs more enemies, weapons, etc.- "Variety" - I would like to see more variety in terms of what you find (different islands have different materials, different enemies, etc)If you're looking for a game where there is a straight line Start ------> Finish, this won't be a good game for you. But if you're looking for a fun, easy to learn (and even relaxing, at times) crafting game to play solo or with friends then I suggest picking it up. If not in its current state, at least sometime down the road.  
Michael Scott	Recommended	25.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198233783112/	Really great game. Love the possiblities with customization and building. Few changes i'd like to see - bug fixed (can't open storage on the second level while anchored)., bow and arrow added (can use planks for arrows and the bow, stone for arrowheads, and vinegoo/rope for the string), and WE NEED NUMBERS ABOVE THE HOTBAR like asap. All survival games have those, why not this? TBH, these are like the only thingsi dislike. And this game has a ton of features. Overall, really really good game. Hope the update happens ASAP.

Polly, Do you know him?	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/czepolly/	After 5 hours of playing single and multiplayer I would recommend this game.Great idea with raft and sea. Sharks are bit annoying for a moment at the beginning.After you got basic stuff it is going to be great.You have to still do something so not boring as other survival games.I would like to see more content or expansions for Raft in near future.Also would be nice to add any other "enemies" except Sharks, or atleast more possiblity how to defeat Sharks.
Ash449	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040121118/	I thoroughly enjoy the game, I first played it when it was on itch.io and since then it has improved greatly! Well worth the buy, I'm excited to see what they continue to do with it.

dachemika	Recommended	39.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030592911/	I love this game.Even though as seasoned survival-crating-game-player you dig through the current progression rather fast, I loved every phase along the way.Bonuspoints for the game to allow you to half-automate a lot of the challenges of the early phases (grappling for floatsam, purifying water). Basic tasks often become busywork later on in other games.And I equally hate that shark as I am terrified by it.I still reliably jump out of the water onto the raft and spent the next few seconds screaming in pent-up terror from diving.But I do love my raft. It keeps me above said shark. :)(I am aware that you can survive a countable number of bites from it and it bites only once each approach.But try not to calculate your dives that way and the game keeps being so much more immersive.)about immersion: If you start to get bored on a has-everything-I-need raft, imagine how you would like your raft if you were actaully on that thing. In a storm. At night.With the shark about.See how much more walls you will add then.  ;)It's one of the games where I consider my money well spent.When / if they add more content, I will be even happier.If you have played it to your heart's content, give it a rest and maybe check back in a few months/updates later.I find that a working aproach for these types of early-access games.

Bubblebeam	Recommended	18.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bubblebeam09212/	For an Early Access game it's really fun and challenging. The game gets even better with multiplayer. The landscape/water is super pretty with it's cartoon graphics. And the build mecahnics are simple/straightforward. It's a nice well rounded survival game. However....It does lack content...and I look forward to updates that start to add more to the game. There's not a whole lot of replay value sadly, and I would like to see that fixed. Possibly more obstacles (besides that ****ing shark), more plants, character customization, decorative items, larger islands and island building, multiple rafts, more things to dive for, tons more research, etc. All and in all, I will continue to enjoy and play the game. I look forward to the many updates ahead.

BENICOPTER	Recommended	17.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198278007536/	This is one of those games that you just love to grind. The gameplay is quick, but I thought it was worth the $20. There is so much potential for this game to be even better. I wrote down some ideas as I was playing:More animals to kill, on land and in water. More enemies. Currently you just worry about the one shark. There’s an occasional storm but it really doesn’t affect anything except vision. Would be interesting to have a rare storm playing on the old saying “red sky at morning sailors take warning” and the storm can cause damage to the raft if it isn’t secure. The storm could also knock you overboard. Other players. Whether computer or PvP, other characters try to steal your supplies. Bigger islands with room to explore. Land animals to hunt. Allow for building on land for better safety during the storm. Ranged weapons (guns, harpoons)More advanced tools and suppliesSteerable ship (rudder, propeller)Larger and better sails (certain sails are faster but harder to control, others are slow but have great agility)Treasure hunting. Find treasure maps to track down loot. **Change the way the characters walk. Currently it looks like the Grinch creeping around during Christmas.

We either just beat the game, or we just started it. I'll admit, I'm intrigued. We're looking forward to seeing where Redbeet goes with this.
Kurylo	Recommended	70.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kurylo/	I was playing an earlier version when it was still an Itch.io project and it was already amazing. When i saw the Trailer I instantly wanted to buy this game when it came out and I wasnt disappointed. When I first played this game I never thought that it would have that much content. 9/11 Would buy again!
Cartoonkiller™	Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cartoonkiller9/	My life was so empty without the empty ocean to survive in
Bubblebeam	Recommended	18.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bubblebeam09212/	For an Early Access game it's really fun and challenging. The game gets even better with multiplayer. The landscape/water is super pretty with it's cartoon graphics. And the build mecahnics are simple/straightforward. It's a nice well rounded survival game. However....It does lack content...and I look forward to updates that start to add more to the game. There's not a whole lot of replay value sadly, and I would like to see that fixed. Possibly more obstacles (besides that ****ing shark), more plants, character customization, decorative items, larger islands and island building, multiple rafts, more things to dive for, tons more research, etc. All and in all, I will continue to enjoy and play the game. I look forward to the many updates ahead.
butcherbrouillette	Not Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/brouillette/	This game is glitchy for me. I hate to give it a poor rating, wish I could vote neutral because I think the concept is pretty neat.  But I would play for a couple hours then nothing would respawn in the water.

fckshoes	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198451891538/	This is a fantastic early access game as is.  The only thing that would make this even better, would be to add larger islands to explore with more "enemies" other than a stalking shark.  Weather patterns, graphics, sounds and mechanics are all great.  Hope to see many updates for this game.
xzachhattackx	Recommended	27.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198827931331/	I LOVE THIS GAME, ive put 26 hours in sofar and im still going. all this game need is pvp and i could litterally play this game forever!
danmerey	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/danmerey/	This game is surprisingly catchy and fun! At least multiplayer (I player with a friend).Not very easy at start (even on Normal difficulty), and still very good after playing for 5 hours. Game should have pack for 2 or 4 players, because it's getting way more better when playing with friends (ship control, separation by duties, healing downed players, emotions, frien talks etc.).You have to buy it if you like survivals and sandboxes. Devs did good job!
DBS	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DBS2500/	Cool game, looking forward to the updates.
ʜᴜʏɴʜ	Recommended	15.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/huynh69/	There is both pros and cons about this game.First of all, I really do like the game!Quite cool survival game, its gives you the "end of the world" feeling, just water and polluted water.BUT, the game has a lack of content, its quite expensive (19,99€), and its not really worth it if you're searching for a long-lasting game.Ofcourse there is negative aspects in every game, but I'd still say this game was worth it(although it was quite expensive). I like these survival games, and the cool "end of the world" feeling made it almost better. Especially that you're stuck on a raft in the middle of the ocean.I haven't played with my friends yet(since I'm the only one who owns the game among my friends), but I'm almost sure that the game would be superfun to play together with a couple friends!The game have everything a survival game needs:(few examples)- Fishing.- Crafting. - Farming resources.- Hunting(in this game - Sharks).- Exploration - New islands/underwater areas.- Building and expanding of your starting territory.And much more!I'd recommend the game.I'll give it 8.5/10 Hungry Sharks. 
Beene	Recommended	11.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968045596/	pls more content, love the game
Gang Doge	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198174799574/	I highly recommend you get this, it's fun, challenging and you can play it with friends! Raft is a game about surviving on a raft, collecting resources passing by you. If you would rather build an insane boat then you can also play creative mode! Theres really not much to say about this besides it is a fun survival game, anyway you should get this if you haven't already!
TheGutlessTurd	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NickAteABrownieOnce/	Fun and boring at the sdame time.... it's foring.
Mordecai	Recommended	34.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DouglasAllen/	Raft is fun but I would love to see more in game like a graple hook to pull the raft closer to an island or raft, perhaps more weapons like a harpoon , I don't  really like the shark atticking the raft constantly and the spear is weak idk why we can't use the axe as a weapon as well but other than that the game is fun.
Free Wifi	Recommended	7.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FreeWifififififififi/	Pull the original survival idea alarm!
WarCook	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198170363797/	Game is pretty good. BUT:- IT's not worth 20EUR.- IT's possible to FINISH in 10-20 hours (Depends what you "want" to do)+ IT will get more updates (So you can back to this game after 2 months, and there will be new things to do [HOPLY xd] )+ IT's fun to play with friends+ You can chill out while playing this gameIf you have more money, and you like surviving games you should buy this.
adidi2110	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198113543694/	good game
HieronymousFlask	Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042362199/	Great co-op game that is super chill. Devs seem invested with updates as well which is very exciting. Hope to see this one expand!

Billy Boo	Recommended	0.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198297810286/	{*Rip Servers}  I brought this game to play with some friends but the servers are really bad (at least here in Greece) and we cant really play together cause we laggin hard.Anyways the game is good as an idea,reminds me forest and i liked forest a lot so...i recommend this game only if you have good internet..otherwise  you will end up playing single player.
joeletto	Recommended	13.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283971895/	Overall the game is an enjoyable one. The biggest thing I would like to see encorperated would be larger islands that you can explore and maybe a few more threats to keep you on your toes. Maybe animals on the islands? Also if there was ever a way to somehow run into other people that would be awesome.

Cashew #blessYou	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/souldev7/	Am so happy to see this finally make it to market. You guys did an EXCELLENT job on this title, and have been waiting for it to come out.A very well made game, which is so RARE these days with early access. The addition of multiplayer was spot on for the game. And I quite enjoyed playing it again.Thank you and good day :)
LlamaMoustache42	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308118084/	This game is truly great.It is very fun and the multiplayer is probably the best part.It is quite challenging in the begining, but don't be discouraged! you just need to keep playing and once you have the basic neccesities it is a lot more fun. I love playing this game with my friends and family.10 out of 5

EpicDignewt	Recommended	17.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198049477546/	It feels like the original barebones demo, but with more detail. Which is good! I'm glad the original elements that drew me into the demo are still present in the updated version.Features I like (in no particular order):The planting system, there are a lot more things to grow.Fishing is cool, good variety of things to catch, plus some goodies.Islands! It's cool to stop by the islands to get things like palm seeds, scrap metal, etc. The trade-off is that you stop floating by the normal materials (like plastic, palm leaves, etc) which means you need to be careful about how long you stay. It keeps you moving, which is awesome!Large amount of items to craft, which means there's always something to upgrade/make as a quality of life change.Asthetics! You have more options for platforms, roofs, windows, doors, etc, you also have the option to paint anything you make if you make enough dyes.Personally, I'd love to see more stuff done with islands, more things you can float by, basically more events with more of a game impact. There could be more animals than the seagull and shark, as well.I'm definitely going to update this with any other thoughts I have about it, this is just my initial thoughts.
Stabf	Not Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/stabf/	This game is so close to being the game I've wanted for so long. I want a game where you start with nothing and build up your own little camp to higher and higher technological levels. I want ATITD but single player. I want RUST without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Sadly, instead of being a fun construction game with survival elements, instead it suffers from the major problems of most modern survival games.First of all: the hunger and thirst bars. They drop WAY too fast, even in easy mode. You will CONSTANTLY be scrambling for food and water while trying to build your raft/fort. On top of that, the tools break constantly, so you're always trying to grab everything floating towards you to build new tools. And then the shark is attacking your boat so you have to poke him off. And don't even bother tryign to get into the water, because the shark will take you down immediately. Birds assault your crops. Even if you kill them, they always come back. Same for the shark. Take a pass on this one if you want a nice construction/building up kind of game.Its all just too frantic.
OwlyChan	Recommended	28.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OwlyChan/	Played it alone so i became friends with a beetroot and called him winston, and then i lost it i think i ate him but im not sure anyways i might or might not have gone insane after two hours on a raft with a beetroot, anyways i enjoyed the game a lot for my two first hours i nearly died from water and food because i was busy doing dumb stuff, i bearly survived 3 times from that mistake and i love the gameplay mechanic, another thing is i belive its made by the same peoiple who made scrap mechanic if im not wrong.
Kiwie	Recommended	23.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shortnameisping/	Wish there's more shark spawning because it's kinda boring if you've reached day 10 or more because there's only one shark to kill. I also hope the updates will be active since it would be good if there's more item to craft :)btw, the video shows that we hook birds, but it's a lie.
svindler21	Recommended	43.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/svindler21/	Pretty nice gameplay, also enjoyable in solo and coop.Only need a some target role after the utopia and maybe more chance to research better stuffs.
Jake The Cat Gamer	Recommended	15.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JakeTheCatGamer/	A good game (5 Stars), it is like Minecraft but on the sea. It is game where you can play by yourself or play with your friends , a great game eventhough it is still in its early access. It is already promising enough that the basic gameplay is already fun. I hope to see more from Raft.

fuzzlepan	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283203741/	This game is amazing, the graphics are so good, i cant even explain how good the gameplay is. i really recommend you get this game!
Venom	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ve6om/	Fun game, get boring after 10 hours.
RagingRook	Recommended	62.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/confixil/	A fantastic game for building the best damn Bass Pro Shop raft you could ever find on the neverending ocean that is Raft. I purchased this game with one intention, to mess around and have a good time. And the game did just that. The game itself could use some more things such as a Boat Motor, Harpoon Gun, Dangerous Weather, more Dangerous Creatures, more Decorations, Shipwrecked Boats, Island Variation, and maybe some Triangular Raft Foundations? Nonetheless, I purchased four copies of this game to give to my friends to play together and it has been amazing. I told them the game is still in early access, so there will be more things at some point in the near future. This game also has a distinct artstyle like Sea of Thieves, which makes it very pleasing to the eye.   This game is keeper for sure, a fantastic game with so much potential. A must buy, even for the price of $19.99.-Glibberd
Physics	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198313238377/	Although I see alot of similarities with this game and The Forest, this game is pretty well made. The first few things you need to make are the spear, the builder hammer, and the ocasional water purifier. Other than that you're on your own. This game requires focus and stategy, other than that I would recoment it to all.
Patience	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ArtsyChristian/	I'm blown away, I'm well pleased with how I spent my $20. This game is super fun!

MissHooligan	Recommended	219.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LilMissHooligan/	I love the game.. a friend gifted it to me.. and oooooooh.. so stoked for that.. any who.. the glitches of the shark attacking nothing is funny.. one thing i wish it had was numbers on the "toolbelt" slots.. easier to figure out which keys are which quickly.. I also learned that hitting ESC to view the "menu" doesn't pause you.. I died of starvation talking to my aunt! GOOD TIMES! I like the challenge,, i've died so many times on easy.. and the fact that that happens makes me happy.. means gotta work hard.. or i'm just HORRIBLE at this game.. I love survival games like this.. i played 7 days to die RELIGIOUSLY.. and to see something new is awesome.. i know it's early access.. so i know there will be glitches.. but even with those happening sometimes.. it's tons of fun! i'm about to buy it for my best friend for her birthday! it's magical!
Sly Noodle	Recommended	39.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SlyNoodle/	Stayed up all night playing the game with a friend. I was not going to get this game because of the 20$ price tag for a game i have to base off of the first raft game but it is really worth it plus i see so much coming for this game. Also the graphics are very pretty
Dreetion	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dreetion/	This is a great game with the potential to be even better. The devs have a solid and enjoyable base here to build a complex and rewarding survival game off of. There isn't too much to do right now but you have to remember, this is in early access. The potential here is enormous and I would love to see this game advance. I highly recommed it to anyone who is a fan of the genre. The concept of being on a raft that you can customize and build while only occationally stopping on land is fun and refreshing. The mechanics work wonderfully and it is a very polished early access game overall. With that said I have a few suggestions to make the game better. Make it easier to get to the higher islands without having to create an obnoxiously tall raft. Being able to build on land is a poential solution or maybe implimenting some kind of grappling hook or portable rope latter. Any kind of climbing system would probably work. Increase the ability to get scrap or decrease the amount of items that need scrap. In my humble opinion, scrap is too hard to come by for the amount of items that need it to craft. The only two ways I am aware of to collect scrap is to harvest it from under an island or get it randomly from a barrel. Either increase the spawn rate for these two methods of collecting, or creating a third method would help alleviate the great scrap shortage. The ability to create a seperate raft than a friend in the same world and sail in different directions and still be able to find each other. I know that more fundamental things should be implimented in the game before this but I feel like this would make the game much more fun to play with friends.I also noticed that sometimes, when my raft is anchored by an island, the game gets a little laggy. Otherwise, great game, highly recommended, and I'm looking forward to continued support from the devs with new and exciting things to craft and places to explore!
Vanhorts	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008173993/	Great fun for the price!Not much content atm, but I enjoyed every bit of it!
getthestrap	Recommended	28.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198122694403/	It's a really good game,Lots of potential,I have faith in this gameBut there's nothing much to do when you've researched all the crafting recipes and built your dream raftI had a LOT of fun playing with my friends.Needs something like a quest to keep the gameplay interesting and also more weapon.I highly reccommend for you guys to try it out.

Michael Scott	Recommended	25.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198233783112/	Really great game. Love the possiblities with customization and building. Few changes i'd like to see - bug fixed (can't open storage on the second level while anchored)., bow and arrow added (can use planks for arrows and the bow, stone for arrowheads, and vinegoo/rope for the string), and WE NEED NUMBERS ABOVE THE HOTBAR like asap. All survival games have those, why not this? TBH, these are like the only thingsi dislike. And this game has a ton of features. Overall, really really good game. Hope the update happens ASAP.
Ro	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156319737/	Sometimes when you use the hook it glishes so even when the hook is realed in you cant switch items (this killed me multiple times)
Loch	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lochmantay/	Isnt enough gameplay for price, however it is a fun game. Took about 10 hours to complete it for me, should be around half the price though.

RedHead	Recommended	0.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356200471/	Fun game, although there is no tutorial or place to pause, so it can be difficult at times to figure stuff out. Took me 10 minutes to build 3 planks of wood. Also, the game experiences a lot of bugs, like sometimes I cannot use my tools. I understand that this game is in its early stages of game development, and it already has a ton of potential. However, I would say that you should buy this game after a few bugs are patched.

Cryokhai	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cryokhai/	Raft.. Well Raft is just swell, I'm looking forward to seeing how it progresses, I'd like to share a small adventure with you;*Clears throat*We load in, 2 people on a small 2x2 Raft... Debris floating on the waves that crash towards us... We begin to gather these materials and expand the size of our raft, we start crafting the essentials... Methods for food and water... I take it upon myself to make a fishing rod....After a couple of fish... I catch a Shoe... I make a "Raised platform" I place this shoe upon it and begin the Religion of the Holy Shoe... my friend then makes a fishing rod as we begin what our savior put us on this raft to do... Catch items for us to place upon his shrine so that he might bless us with Barrels of Materials... A third friend joins us on our raft, He does not agree to follow the ways of the Holy Shoe, He mocks the Holy Shoe...As he slept that night, We drove our spears through his body, he did not return.Long reign the Holy Shoe, Guide us on our path to salvation.
Dartz	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dartzz/	Fun but can get very boring at times it is a good and unique game though i would reccomend this to anyone willing to play multiplayer or with friends or if you just like going solo. The shark is your friend :)!

aercher_28	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083043771/	Good game only one complaint there should be a tiller to control thedirection of the raft or what side the raft is facing
Turmoil	Recommended	6.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Turmoil90/	After playing this game with a group of 3 players I must say it's probably too easy for groups. Once the initial problem of food and water are addressed and the group has a constant stream of supplies it's really just a waiting game to build things. Even the shark in this game poses no danger to the point where we would actively throw ourselvs into the water just to fight it for entertainment.From a single player standpoint I think it would be much more challenging to keep up with the demands of survival but as it stands a coordinated group trivializes the game.Things I would like to see. More random events, storms, hurricanes, shark schools, anything to add difficulty to groups. There needs to be more end-game as well. Is it worth the $20? I would say if you like survival games and have a group to play with then yes it's definitely worth it. In its current state I would not play it solo but thats just because I believe the added players add something to the game.
Roadworrieor	Recommended	20.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roadworrieor/	Very fun, but lacks stuff to do. I completed the game in under 2 hours. I ran out of stuff to do and just started building which got boring fast.
HECTOR	Recommended	24.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZedigPenis/	This game is so, so great, i picked it up with a friend 2 days ago and we just couldn't let go of it, for an early access game, there is so much to do and learn, it's crazy.It's beautiful, it's clever, the mechanics are great, the concept is awesome, the shark is scary, i can't wait for updates to see what the devs are up their sleeves, 10/10
TheJFKexperience Skinhub.com	Recommended	21.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198247890112/	This game is great the cartoony art style the constant updates and 3 different modes to fit your style of how you want to play. overall buy this game especially if you have someone else to play with sence its multiplayer. 
icecreamflinger	Recommended	34.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/icecreamflinger/	Can plant radishes in a shoe. 10/10 would recommend.
how do i play this game	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198298920296/	i died like 8923765 to the shark.......
SeeK.	Recommended	24.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SeeKy12/	I'm exploring an island for a few resources and suddenly i'm in the middle of the ocean with a huge fog .14/10
Jennifufu	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005917155/	So, what to say about raft.. um.. I don't normally do these but let's do a pro con thing, I'm going to use some of these things twice because they could be considered a good or bad thing depending on who it is that's playing the game.Pros: -It's calming (once you get a basic survival setup going).-It lacks a story driven narrative.-There is only one shark enemy at a time.Cons: -It lacks a story driven narrative.-Can't craft some basic items such as a bow and arrows.-Can't build under the water (if you had the resources available and wanted to build something to keep you safe from the shark while diving for resources for instance).-A single shark is the only enemy.-There is only ever one shark at a time. -Sharks can swim through islands and rock mounds and bite you through them without you ever actually seeing them.-Waves go through the base level and base level walls of your raft as if they weren't even there.-There is no anvil nor metal hammer so it doesn't make any sense that you can make nails, bolts, hinges, and metal tipped spears.         -Base raft platform only takes wood and plastic to build but you can clearly see 14 nails in every single one of them and that wouldn't be a big deal is nails weren't so difficult to make.-There is a limited amount of playability, once you have a basic setup there is no particular reason to do anything other than stock up water and food and once that's done that's pretty much it, you just sit there and persist.All in all I find the game enjoyable, I believe the $20 price point would be better at $15 due to the somewhat limited amount of content though I'm sure more will be added to the game so it's more than likely a moot point. I personally would wait until there is more content added before purchasing, if I had it to do again. Still, it is enjoyable. 
Glacial Impala	Recommended	9.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/glacialimpala/	I was very sceptical (and hopeful) after seeing other reviews, mentioning that lack of content justifies Returns and that there's no more than 90min of gameplay.Well, I just finished a 4h session with 2 friends and we'd play more if we had the time!The game is excellent and has a ton of potential! We managed to research pretty much everything but didn't build it all because of lack of resources (some you can only get underwater near the islands). You also lose EVERYTHING on you when you die so we lost a lot of complex things that way.And the shark ate like 5 anchors and a sail.I hope it gets the developer's dedication for years to come.If you're a single player I suggest you try it out but keep an eye on that 120min Return mark... I'm afraid it's nowere near as much fun without friends that have voice communication.Oh, and as far as bugs and glitches go, we only had one, when a friend tried to drop 18 Wood the 'box' hung mid-air for a minute, then disappeared. Not too bad.
Gang Doge	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198174799574/	I highly recommend you get this, it's fun, challenging and you can play it with friends! Raft is a game about surviving on a raft, collecting resources passing by you. If you would rather build an insane boat then you can also play creative mode! Theres really not much to say about this besides it is a fun survival game, anyway you should get this if you haven't already!
ActiveGamersNL	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198167851914/	I really liked the game for the first 10 hours. After that it became boring. I like these kind of games and I really hope to see more updates in the future. For example more items to craft, more animals and more exploration. Now you can only find islands and these other little rafts. I hope more is about to come because it is a really nice game. I understand it is only early access but I hope the developers will add more updates soon. I rate 6.5/10 for now. Keep up the good work!
Boring	Recommended	39.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GamingPatat/	Amazing Game doesn’t even feel like It’s an early access
bluebaron201	Recommended	2.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000806935/	3.5/5The game needs a reduced boat bounce for motion sickness. I do not have this problem in other games or on a real boat.
MissHooligan	Recommended	219.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LilMissHooligan/	I love the game.. a friend gifted it to me.. and oooooooh.. so stoked for that.. any who.. the glitches of the shark attacking nothing is funny.. one thing i wish it had was numbers on the "toolbelt" slots.. easier to figure out which keys are which quickly.. I also learned that hitting ESC to view the "menu" doesn't pause you.. I died of starvation talking to my aunt! GOOD TIMES! I like the challenge,, i've died so many times on easy.. and the fact that that happens makes me happy.. means gotta work hard.. or i'm just HORRIBLE at this game.. I love survival games like this.. i played 7 days to die RELIGIOUSLY.. and to see something new is awesome.. i know it's early access.. so i know there will be glitches.. but even with those happening sometimes.. it's tons of fun! i'm about to buy it for my best friend for her birthday! it's magical!
SaiaJombloMz	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NaikSepeda/	Hope This Game Stay Alive Forever
Cryokhai	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cryokhai/	Raft.. Well Raft is just swell, I'm looking forward to seeing how it progresses, I'd like to share a small adventure with you;*Clears throat*We load in, 2 people on a small 2x2 Raft... Debris floating on the waves that crash towards us... We begin to gather these materials and expand the size of our raft, we start crafting the essentials... Methods for food and water... I take it upon myself to make a fishing rod....After a couple of fish... I catch a Shoe... I make a "Raised platform" I place this shoe upon it and begin the Religion of the Holy Shoe... my friend then makes a fishing rod as we begin what our savior put us on this raft to do... Catch items for us to place upon his shrine so that he might bless us with Barrels of Materials... A third friend joins us on our raft, He does not agree to follow the ways of the Holy Shoe, He mocks the Holy Shoe...As he slept that night, We drove our spears through his body, he did not return.Long reign the Holy Shoe, Guide us on our path to salvation.
Dartz	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dartzz/	Fun but can get very boring at times it is a good and unique game though i would reccomend this to anyone willing to play multiplayer or with friends or if you just like going solo. The shark is your friend :)!

Aeren	Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/meganmegan171/	Super addicting. Better with friends as solo is a bit tidious.
Panda	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/itrpanda/	Really fun game, totally recommend if you have friends to play with.
WolfAttackz_YT	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198259997791/	This game is a ton of fun played it for only a fem hours and im hooked already (get it) Anyways everything about this game is amesome and its so simple to play easy for my computer to run lots of stuff to do and so on! One thing i do have a problem is and thats the multiplayer part of it... at the moment it seems you can only play with your steam friends so if you have no friends that have RAFT dont expect any multiplayer action! This is the ONLY problem i have with the game and i wish they would add a feature where you could join a random game with someone or where you can post looking for a game or post looking for players to join! :D I think a lot of players would agree with me!
Matt	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008185938/	Lost boat in creative mode. Lost at sea. Send help.
CrazyMan21405	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/crazymangaming21405/	I Have been supporting this game since it was on itch.io now i am able to play it with multiplayer on steam but its a realy fun game so i hope you brought your hook and lets start building a raft
ttv/DontScreenPeek	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/longdongleo/	Game reminds me of Minecraft at sea. A lot of fun and different things to do. Game has not got repetitve to me yet as there is a wide variety of things to do.
Ramone	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/iiVexation/	To be honest, this game is so amazing.Me and a friend have been playing this non stop after work and when we have free time, it's amazing.I'd honestly recommend.It has bugs, annoying ones at that, but it's early access, what do you expect?It only came out recently too, so we expect it.Recommend 10/10 would buy again.
Gigtronics	Recommended	15.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/akamikazel/	Great game. planning to stream it soon.
NB	Recommended	24.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/propma/	This game will cause you to have a growing hatred for sharks, and condition you to salivate and become excited when you come across barrels
meattape	Recommended	17.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chickenpiev2/	This game still makes me feel glad that people eat shark fin soup
Preben	Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148899969/	Great game! it is already adicting to play, cant wait for the updates! 8/10.Please try this when you desperately try to look for games to hook you.
Violent	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119404968/	9.5/10 Would buy again very fun!
Baby HyumI	Recommended	50.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/elynd/	A simple survival game which makes you intense. Nearly finish the game within 15hours. (Not rushing to end)Since this game is still early access, will look forward for more updates. Hoping for:- New tools - Add in more interaction like using hook while sitting on a chair- More raw ingredients- MAKE STONE USEFUL- New sea creature will be nice- New weapon etc bow (high hope)Content is the most important things that need to be added. Make the game less easy to end even in easy mode.9/10 for the graphic7/10 for the content10/10 recommend playing with 3-4 friends to make the game more harder as more resources is required to make bigger raft and more food is needed to feed everyone. 
degususaskulusku	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198296929870/	Sure, it's a simple concept; you have a tiny raft and a hook, go make it bigger and live, but it sure as hell is fun to play (at least with friends). Give it a go and you will probably enjoy it.
Chicken.tv	Recommended	26.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bwachbwach/	This is a game that has been needing to be made, Don't let that survival tag fool you this is an adventure like no other. I wish there was more to the story, hell there might be they are still adding stuff to the game as we speak. I played it with my fiance and we both are addicted even after finishing up to what the end is.
Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/snackbae420/	Game is great. Had about 6+ hours of game progression and adventure with 2 other friends. $20 well spent-- I look forward to future updates.

Fizzy [Wflizzi]	Recommended	14.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016180889/	Very fun game, fun with friends and a great experience for all, can be a little boring end game where there is nothing to do but your journey to end game is amazing!
Frost Vanilla	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198180292450/	More updates please ! Thank you Buy it you will love it but it gets boring when you collected all more challenges too !
Depressed Sloth	Recommended	52.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DepressedSloth/	This game is extremely fun and very enjoyable to play. Whether you decide to play on your own or with friends it's a great sense of enjoyment and well worth the purchase. This game is still early access so please keep that in mind when deciding on buying it, there is plenty of ideas to be added for the future and I do hope those updates continue to create such an enjoyable atmosphere when playing!-As a small sidenote there is an official RAFT Discord and the suggestions/ideas players have to input are left amongst channels within the Discord. Dev's are listening to us and we may see a huge variety of updates in time to come so be prepared for consistent future updates because I'm more than sure they're coming at some point!
Pugfert	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ipinti/	I like this game, me , my brother and some friends of mine bought this game and we had a blast so far , but it is kinda pricey. I live in Romania and 1 euro it's like 5 Ron , so 20€ it's about 100 Ron which is pretty expensive in my country. But I like this game. Recommend
snakeyes27	Recommended	24.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/snakeyes27/	Amazing game! Been a while since I enjoyed a survival crafting game, and this one does that in a great way! Tons of fun, but needs more content, much more content and things to research. I recommend:1- Map: make it huge and I want to know where I am and where I was and where I am going2- More island varieties: islands with beach, or wider islands with forests, or islands with volcanoes with a large number of ores to mine3- Sonar and deep water scuba diving gear: deep underwater exploration is what I really wished I could do. I enjoyed the diving part but I wanted to go even deeper. Have an underwater flashlight, bigger oxygen tank, goggles and go! Sonar to detect underwater treasure!4- an electric generator for sonar and radar, radar being able to detect multiple things above water, and also rotary engine that uses electric power5- weapons and enemies: have more, maybe a retractable harpoon gun or build harpoons out of stone, and then metal for more damage. As for enemies, maybe a large octopus during the deep sea dive?These are just some ideas I had in mind as I was playing the game and wished were there. But overall love it to bits and wish to see more and more content. Recommended! 
╰☆╮Acacia╰☆╮	Recommended	24.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ultimateweapon1/	Buy this!I had no idea what this game was going to be about, but I jumped right in it in Hard Mode, which is kind of Permadeath if you play solo. It took me 5 retries to eventually get a stable start in which I could survive and reach the endgame. That's a great balance: not too difficult and not too easy either.I recommend you to play it the same way in your first playthrough.It was a real joy to figure everything out and getting a few surprises along the way.It doesn't need a tutorial and plays entirely self-explanatory, like a game should be.The sound is good, the music is great, the graphics are really sweet.I didn't come accross any bugs nor stuttering. The loot, items and crafting are all very well balanced. I've played many games and I really can't find any fault in this one.It was a real joy to play from beginning to end.Considering it's still in early access I hope the focus will be on adding more content, more surprises. The game reminds me of Portal 1. And I hope they'll take this concept and explore it further storywise, similar to what Valve did with Portal 2.20 bucks is justified.Don't wait for discounts, Buy this!
suicidalkittens_	Recommended	12.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/suicidalkittens_/	Amazing game, managed to finish it with a friend in 8 ours and loved every minuite.fishing is nice and relaxing and i love collecting the resources amlost a mini game to get them (wood has very precise hitbox and it spinning and you missing is common)cant wait for more late game tech as the last thing you get requires a battery would like to see things likea motor and scuba equipment.also needs more enemies even if the shark is supoer cool.will return to this game futher down the line to see what fun and exciting stuff has been added
SoupJesus	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198384304170/	A simple yet entertaining concept, though hopefully more content to come, including a storyline instead of just surviving.
|U.B.C.S| LoneTuber	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xxlonewolfxx12345/	My brother and I Purchased yesterday (got the 20% discount assuming for owning Scrap Mech?), We managed to get in just over two hours of play, we were a bit sceptical at first like many however after a few deaths and some learning we ended up being extremely engrossed in this game but unfortunately sleep was needed due to work the next day so was forced to stop.The game play is fun and keeps you on your toes (or on your raft) with the sharks, there seems to be plenty of things to craft although I have not managed to craft everything yet.I do however think perhaps there should be more rafts or wrecks to obtain supplies from and less drifting as although I know the ocean is full of rubbish, the amount passing by seems to be rather a lot.The islands need to have a shoreline and not be a mountain styled thing you have to build stairs to get onto along with being bigger.Not sure if it is just because I have rubbish gear but I do see that hunger goes down very very fast and water seems to be reasonable slow so I do think some balancing needs doing on this part as I think this needs to be the other way around due to water being the main requirement of our bodies.Graphics! What can I say but awesome, if you crank the settings to max you will have a brilliant experience and it does not even require much of a powerhouse as I only have a 1050ti 4GB (I was also using Steam Streaming over wi-Fi on host and client).Not quite sure why some people are giving poor reviews due to them dying or unable to get something as this to me just seems like they are incapable of learning how to play the game as it cannot be much more straightforward, the menu systems are clear and easy to navigate, I have not once since playing looked under controls in options as its got your standard survival setup.There are however things I would add/change but obviously this would be why the game is in EA so I look forward to what the future of this game holds especially seeing the amount of sales this game has already produced.
Honest Nun	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198405406757/	Excellent survival game!  I can not wait for it to evolve
Den Kraftigste Magikern	Recommended	43.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028759231/	I LOST 3 FRIENDS, BUT GAINED 3 MATEYS! JARRR!
Puttnix	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999773049/	Not bad! Only around 4-6h of content so far but there is great potential for this game!
Tomless	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/timmythewizard/	Pros: Easy to learnGreat art style, soundtrack and creativity Replayability Pretty relaxing after a long dayFun to play with friendsCons: (Although most of these I feel will be fixed since this IS early access) (Although I feel this is more or less a personal preference) The Shark is quite annoying, I find it just too much of a risk to go out and get supplies because the shark will always stay in a radius around you, and attacking your raft as frequently as it does  does  get quite annoying and frustrating. Multiplayer is extremely buggy. Two players is alright, but any more and the game will bug out frequently. Aside from the shark, food and water, there aren't too many challenges.Aside from those, a really amazing game! Loads of fun and I highly recommend buying it!  
Ultimesia	Recommended	58.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079210991/	The game was much more fun and strategic then I thought it would be. I would strongly advise that you play with multiple people this way you're not struggling to manage food, water, a shark, and the seagulls on your own. We had a bug where things would freeze in mid-air when tossing them out.
Trollid	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trollid420/	This game feels like it has alot of potential. I bought this game with two friends and we've had some pretty fun hours in the game. But i would never imagine playing it solo. Keeping in mind that it is Early Access i think it still is a pretty fun game to play with a couple of friends. We've hit the 10hour mark and we feel we are getting to the endgame content so there is still alot of room for upgrades that i hope the developers are working on.If you and your friends don't know what to play one day this should be fun to play together. If still in doubt to buy then wait for more content or a discount on it.
Austin	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/198497561/	FIrst of all I want to say that i dont write review for many games.I also dont play that many Survival Games.but RAFT is truely one of my favorite games of all time and i havent even played co-op.Raft is a simple game but has lots of content to go with it.Very Noob friendly.But Is it worth the $20Yes.i even bought it for 3 of my other friends because i had such a fun time playing by my self.

TheOnlyJordan	Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theonlyjordan/	Good game, only 2 hours played so far but could easily be many more, as it's one of those games that sucks you in for hours at a time. I would reccomended playing with friends though, I can imagine it'd get tedious playing alone, but with friends it can produce hours of fun.
Superkebabbie	Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superkebabbie/	An amazing game to just "dive" into. It's laid back, immersive and has that subtle motivation of survival to keep you going.

voidz	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198269370663/	raft takes a turn on those resourse grinding crafting type games as you float through an ocean filled with junk. the objective is to survive there is no real ending as of 8/18/2018. you fight of sharks while trying to get the materials needed to build a cummunication device of sorts. so far its a good game however the story is not finished so dont bother looking for utopia. the only real downer is if you lose your raft say it moved to fast for you to get back to your done for. you cant build a new one even if you have all the materials. once you spawn on those four squres you cant live without them.

Atmos	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/joshmann97/	This game is super fun, even by yourself it is real fun. Yes, there isn't so much to do just yet but the survival is engaging and it you will have a FAT laugh if you play with friends. Kinda reminds me of minecraft skyblock.
A Purple Manatee	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/apurplemanatee42/	I bought this game a few days ago and I have been obsessed with the game. I had enjoyed the game Stranded Deep but was looking for something a little more casual and multiplayer, and thought this looked like a good alternative. Here are some pro's and con's of it thus far (as of writing this, it is still in Early Access Alpha here on Steam). Note that I'm only a casual fan of the "survival/crafting" genre of games like Minecraft. + Easy to understand crafting+ Art style; this ain't no Minecraft cube stuff+ Various levels of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Creative+ Multiplayer; I think this game is probably most fun with friends but not absolutely needed like in Rust+ Small download - 250 MB+ Rewarding crafting - being able to survive "easier" as you go along- Content - as it is EAA there COULD be much more, and there should be more to come. Needs more enemies, weapons, etc.- "Variety" - I would like to see more variety in terms of what you find (different islands have different materials, different enemies, etc)If you're looking for a game where there is a straight line Start ------> Finish, this won't be a good game for you. But if you're looking for a fun, easy to learn (and even relaxing, at times) crafting game to play solo or with friends then I suggest picking it up. If not in its current state, at least sometime down the road.  
JECTION!	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jection/	Awesome game looking forward to further updates couple. Simple Well thought out. Needs tweaking here and there but overall. Fast download, ran great friends were ale to drop in and drop out via steam. didnt crash . Hits all its marks. Awesome work looking forward to more.
Texas Red	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094366658/	They added a FOV slider, games Gucci now
123	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198166116903/	Very fun and relaxing! But I think if they want you to play more than 50 hours, they need to do something, because I think I will get bored eventually. There is also some problems that they should fix, getting stuck in nets on your raft and that only one person can be in the same storage box at the same time.
dimitri_2018@hotmail.ru	Recommended	19.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tf2isbad/	first of all , its worth it.this game is so much fun like the alpha version maybe boring but this version add so many things.also there is multiplayer and playing with friends is insanely fun. 
hda20	Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198411544002/	very laggy but once that has been fix it will be a very good game
Aloof	Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cdmOwl/	Might sound kind of weird but I got really motion sick by the 1 hour mark. Its weird because I can't remember the last time I've been motion sick. The game is pretty fun to progress through and upgrade your boat but not sure its worth the sickness if you are sensitive to that kind of thing

Kurylo	Recommended	70.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kurylo/	I was playing an earlier version when it was still an Itch.io project and it was already amazing. When i saw the Trailer I instantly wanted to buy this game when it came out and I wasnt disappointed. When I first played this game I never thought that it would have that much content. 9/11 Would buy again!
Mex	Recommended	94.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198825838911/	It's  Awesome
TheOnlyJordan	Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theonlyjordan/	Good game, only 2 hours played so far but could easily be many more, as it's one of those games that sucks you in for hours at a time. I would reccomended playing with friends though, I can imagine it'd get tedious playing alone, but with friends it can produce hours of fun.
Superkebabbie	Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superkebabbie/	An amazing game to just "dive" into. It's laid back, immersive and has that subtle motivation of survival to keep you going.

Protonic	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/liamcase0102/	Good game but at the moment every easy to do everything.I only got the game yesterday and now i am done with the game i have crafted everything and been everywhere. but the game is very good and and become something great.By the way i played on hard the hole time didnt know when you die your ♥♥♥♥ed so yea that was fun and also hard so to easy xD
George Castanza	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086008567/	Went into this game blind, but it paid off big time! If you love medium core survival, building, and exploration, this game is for you.Pros: -Fluid animations with minimal glitches.-Fun online multiplayer (friends only)-Sea diving exploration; hidden chests, somewhat hard to find resources.-Decent variety of building shapes for more boat designs.-Entertaining game mechanics; fishing, fending off the shark, farming.-Decent amount of things to craft for your character and your ship.-Rewarding progression (for the most part).Cons: -Non rewarding engame (end game is a radio antenna to track abandoned ships)-Repetative gameplay after the 15 hour mark-Islands are very boring/small with nothing to explore upon.-A lot of materials, but most only serve one purpose.-Besides exploring the sea around islands, there is NOTHING to explore underwater.-Hunger and food system is tough at first, but becomes easier later on.-No girl player models Kappa-Shark is intimidating at first, but can be easily exploited.-Only 2 tiers of gear at the moment.Overall I would say that this game is great. It has a lot of potential going for it, and if done right will be worth hours of more fun. Right now "end game" is my opinion is building your boat to your hearts desire, but with that being the only real engame right now, it gets very hard for me to play longer than an hour or two at a time.     7/10 TL;DR, 7/10 Great game to play, but wont hold your attention for longer than 30 hours of game play in my opinion,   
tiger	Recommended	12.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tigerphyre/	Love this game so far! Can't wait to see where it goes in the future but definitely excited! I had no problem spending $20 on this game ( I even bought it for my SO) and after playing would say that $20 is a fair price. I think that if you're interested but unsure, take the leap!I have almost 9 hours on record before posting this review but can honestly say I enjoy it loads. I have found very little bugs considering it's Early Access status. Smooth sailing B) with Online Multiplayer/Co-Op, haven't had any considerable issues. The game is cute. Buy it. Have fun with friends or make the coolest friggen boat in creative.
Maple Bacon Pancakes	Recommended	2.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dogeinataco/	It's good
Lazar93	Recommended	17.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040273026/	Had a great time with the game while it lasted.It is in early access but still after an hour of 6-7 when you have everything and know how its done there is nothing left to do.I would recommand this to anyone wanting to play it with a friend. It is great fun but a bit shallow in the end (pun not intended) Great Co-op survival. Wish more games did this.Can't wait for what they will add.
Bassykins	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/basbro/	Still a bit lean but felt very good - barely encountered any bugs and none of them gamebreaking, had lots of fun playing with a friend, no multiplayer issues at all.
TimeSauce	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TimeSauce/	THIS IS SOOOO GOOD!!! I just started playing with my friend and im already hooked! I recommend this game to everyone!
Pennywisepuma	Recommended	28.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198123632305/	I thoroughly enjoyed the idea, and the game it's self. I found myself enjoying the building, and crafting. The game as an early access is very well executed, and feels great to play. This big bonus is it's price, 20 dollars is perfect for a game that is unfinished. Here is my list of pros, and cons:PROS:-The game looks good-The game handles well, and proforms well-Getting loot is fun-Building is fun, and limitless-It allows the player to figure it out as it is played, leaving questions, which makes the game more imemersive-The ability to play co-op adds so much more fun to the game, and the experience-The differences in difficulty are reasonable, and well adjusted-unique and new idea all around-immersive-can be challenging if played on hard-rewarding loot system-the soundtrack is excellent-graphics are good and original in a sense-loot is spread out fairly based on its uses-the ability to customize your raft, is fun and you could spend hours just making the coolest raft you could think of-overall fun with friends, I will say it 100 timesCONS:-There are slight bugs ( but the game is early access and being updated and fixed frequently)-Lot's of dead space in the gameplay, not a terribly negative thing, just feel there is a lack in the amount of materials, and craftable items-friends are unable to build their own rafts if playing co-op-combat with the shark is a bit off. I feel the spear should be long enough to reach the top of the water and hit the shark when it is surfaced. ( more of an opinion)-Fast moving, I leanred all the craftable items in like one hour on hard, and the just spent hours diving and throwing a hook-The game has little replay value, unless you want to spend all day making the worlds biggest raft, once you get to the pressumed end game, there is very little for the player to accomplish. I got to the end game in 3 hours and although I enjoyed the assumed story, it happened way to fast and left me wanting a goal to reach or and new item to craft.OVERALL:Overall I believe this game is new and refreshing. It is worth the purchase, for the basic play of the game, but mostly the potential future of the game as it's updated. The mysterious feeling of first loading in and trying to figure out the mechanics, loot system, and surroundings, is a good feeling. Many survival games have failed to impresss, always answering questions and not allowing the player to learn as they go ( the easy way or the hard way ) I 100% would purchase this game again, while it leaves more to be desired, the idea that there could be anything added to its mechanics, or story makes me excited for the future of this game. I just want more craftable items and more of a goal based system after the endgame, besides floating around and making a giant raft. I would recomend this to anyone, and had a lot of fun playing it. The biggest selling point is the ability to play with friends, haven't laughed that hard in a while.

Windows 98	Recommended	16.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nayrisian/	For an early access, this is one of the few aspiring for a stable and fun experience.There's a lot of waiting around, relaxing... Cooking continuously. So don't expect high action octane... Unless you fall off the raft through de-sync and you cannot get back up because that same de-sync thinks you're still in the water.The gameplay is reminiscent of Minecraft Skyblock, where you start with nothing and through farming methods, you create a large 'island'. Except, this game is actually entertaining compared to Skyblock.The raft customisation is great, modding will make that better. This type of game would probably work well with the Rimworld style of development in that regard. Where they only work on the core game, letting modders build upon the game themselves.The first experience you have when beginning the game is well done. It lacks a tutorial, which is great. Games don't need tutorials when they're fundemental like this. Just flash some hotkeys for basic tasks like opening inventory and throwing your hook. There, done, no more. The quality of mystery adds a lot of replayability for the rest few times of your experience.The current game state at 30/05/18 lacks and would probably benefit from these... - Features neededOfficial Steam modding support.FOV slider. (Like FPS, good feature)Thirst draining multiplier/sliders.Hunger draining multiplier/sliders.Raft rotating mechanism. (Rudder? Trying to wedge your raft around an island for this is painful)Item stack limit changes.Durability multiplier/sliders.These ones border on the improbable to implement... - Features that would be goodRaft pirating - Stealing other rafts?NPCs - Trading, ties into pirating too.Progression system of enemies after sharks.Dolphins that could act as 'teleports' to take you to your raft if you're far away. Like on an island. (If not on a hardcore difficulty, because ♥♥♥♥ you for forgetting to monitor your raft) - Current problems with the gameItems stop spawning, you have to realign your raft sometimes with a sail.Crashes seem to be consistent in multiplayer, for the clients. [Semi-fixed?]Player positions have a tendency to be offset from their actual position for the remote clients.Within 2 days of the review, the severe problems were fixed. Seems great so far. 
Kashaadri	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kashaadri/	This game is really fun with friends. Very intuitive and awesome concept. I highly recommed. I'm having a blast with my gaming buds. It's definitely something new and I've played many survival games and this one is the bees knees. Graphics are nice, and gameplay is smooth! For early access, this game was well worth the cost.
Edge	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Edge1991/	This is an AMAZING game! I've played like 16 hours so far and I love it.

Demasis	Recommended	89.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Demasis/	I remember more than a year ago when I stumbled upon this freeware game, I absolutely fell in love with it!I bought this game the hour it was released!I wish the game had some more dynamics that could make the game more interesting during multiplayer and also story-line wise.Thoughts I had playing the new releaseDozens of messages in bottles that float down gradually explaining the story-line (non-inventory burdening)Multiplayer features where someone can take control of a 2nd shark to bite you in the water or destroy the ship.Tier 2 raft objects for everything that makes them sturdierScrap metal barbed wire lining for Anti-shark around the raft. Thank you to everyone developing this game and keep up the good work!
Trashboat	Recommended	3.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtrashboat/	Don't make any judgements about this game before you buy it. I know it says "Early Access", and "Survival" in the tags, but this one... this one is different. This game has so much potential. I find little to no bugs in the gameplay, making the experience even better albeit unfinished. It's great in singleplayer, and 4 man co-op makes the game more interesting.
meeksorad	Recommended	27.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165259256/	This game is amazing! I do think that $20 is a bit much but if they continue updating it then it will be totally worth it. It does need more in it though. My thoughts on some additions:Motor: To move against the wind and move faster.Description: For when a sail is just not enough.Map: To see where you have been within 10k meters.Description: Explore the unknown with renewed vigor!Gunpowder: Made from sand and rock(Change it how you will.)Description: Used to make something powerful!Pistol: Able to shoot the shark at longer ranges.Description:  For when a spear is just not enough!Rifle: Able to shoot the shark at even longer ranges.Description: Able to shoot enemies from long distances.Scrap Foundation: Stronger foundation than normal wood one.Description:  Sharks will have a tough time chewing through this!Foundation spikes: They stab the shark when he tries to eat them. (Maybe has two durability? Two shark attacks?)Description:  Stop them from even getting close.Tiller: Turns your boat around. After getting hit by a island or ghost boat.Description:  Able to turn your boat around.Harpoon gun: Shoots a hook at extreme distances. Able to hook onto the ghost boats and pull you it closer to you.Description:  Able to reach the farthest loot and boats.I will update this at a later time. I hope you enjoyed my suggestions!
iNfeC	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IneffectiveTaze/	Great game and very relaxing. Needs some more items to build and some endgame stuff so lets see what the early access has to offer. Needs FOV options though.
Maveric0484	Recommended	30.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069573755/	This game is pretty awesome! Worth the $20 I paid for it. When you play solo, it's not laggy at all, but when you play online with someone, whomever the host isn't, the game is very laggy, and hard to play. That's my only complaint for the game, The creators just need to fix the online play. I highly recommond this game. 10/10

Trollid	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trollid420/	This game feels like it has alot of potential. I bought this game with two friends and we've had some pretty fun hours in the game.

We've hit the 10hour mark and we feel we are getting to the endgame content so there is still alot of room for upgrades that i hope the developers are working on.If you and your friends don't know what to play one day this should be fun to play together. If still in doubt to buy then wait for more content or a discount on it.

Lemonmoon	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/icklepei/	My favorite game in the survival genre so far.What I love about it is probably what a lot of people don't like about it.  It's a causal survival game with an end goal other than lasting for 365 days. You don't have to sink a ton of hours into it before you can start crafting the fun stuff. I love the puzzle aspect to exploring the islands which are often solved with parkour as well as building.The only con is that there is little replay value, however at the time of this review the game is very new. The game foreshadows more story content. I would play again with different friends for a fresh feel.I feel it was worth paying 20 bucks for a very enjoyable 11 hours of game play.

Dorian	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DorianDirban/	It took me about 7 hours to go through all the content that is currently available and I had a great time doing it. The game has a gradual progression where you first collect swimming resources, then make your way onto islands, and finally underwater. There is a final goal already in the game, which might become the beginning of a greater story in the future. You should be aware that this game is a survival "light" experience, where there are dangers in the environment, but you can relatively easily evade them if you know what you are doing. I did not experience any game-breaking bugs and it was overall a very polished experience. If the price tag seems a big steep at the moment, I recommend holding off and waiting for more items, more quests, and more enemies, which are sure to come.

KGB666	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154670854/	this is a great little game, can be quite challenging for new comers but pays off when you have a mansion of a raft.its a great game however i feel it's lacking content and i would say wait for more before paying $20 having said that i have enjoyed the game very much.
DanielGamer63	Recommended	12.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DanielGamer63/	The game is sooo good i recommend to everyone. The game has grown so much from itch.io but it has some bugs and i think they need to add more uses for brick just little things like that. i also think they should add a better shark bait that you could pick up or poison the shark for some of its health. Over all its a great game and im hooked to the game.
Determination	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Blueshirt/	This is a fun game, a nice new experience and a bit casual for busier people like me and not overpriced too badly (it should be with more content and gameplay systems though). You start out struggling to survive and in an hour or two you achieve a point where you're established in food, water and basic resource harvesting (wood and scrap primarily). At which point you sort of do what you like.In its current state its playable and fun, but underdeveloped for content and has its problems (early access duh). If the games satisfies all these issues below its perfectly suited for its price of £15 and even possibly worth more than that. Its current frustrations to me mainly are:A distinct lack of pathing/collisions for the shark and birds. They dont play by the rules you do and are annoying/unfair for clipping through your raft and the island.A lack of physics in general. Rafts not damaging on collision with islands, sails not turning the ship when they're placed off centre and a general lack of need to not change your ship from just being a floating island with random stuff strewn across it. And as far as I can tell being able to build it as top heavy as you like.Seeds, my reccomendation is to take a "Oxygen not Included" approach to seeds. You harvest the plant and you automatically replant a new one, then keep current seed drop rates or make them rarer. You're already wasting time/resources on chasing seagulls and buildings scarecrows or axes, not being able to 'keep progress' is a bummer. Especially when food is a non issue with fishing. Scarecrows not being repairable with wood or plastic is really annoying for some reason, I cant figure out why but probably something to do with not really fixing the problem.Upgraded tools. These dont really feel like upgrades, the durability rise doesnt provide more value than the consumption of metal and scrap. I'd reccomend them having durability but being repairable with plastic/wood or at least being able to keep some of the metal from making them when they break. Its better to make the armoured platforms than the metal spear especially as the worst culprit. The one exception is the upgraded hook, but I only use that for scuba scavenging so that is still wasted potential really. An upgraded axe feels disctinctly missing. This problem applies to the equipment like flippers and oxygen bottles too, they could use upgrades, but they feel like a waste of vinegoo especially when shark bait doesnt have an upgrade either.Inventory management. Its so easily cluttered and I find its easy to accumulate junk resources. A button and filter to throw unwanted items overboard, more uses for junk items (mid/end game), these being the veggie drops, rocks and plastic. (Plastic is especially frustrating, I want to keep it because you build with it, but it just isn't as useful as wood)A lack of danger. This is funny when you consider there is a shark stalking you 24/7 that never seems to starve to death but still disctinctly acts like you're its only food source rather than all the fish everywhere. But a basic need for shade from the sun would really help encourage building rafts as homes rather than a project after you're 'established'. But being isolated out on the ocean should mean storms or sun all day should both come up with their own threats to you that you need to build around.A lack of content. I know this is planned anyway, but I do agree if the price bothers you and you might not pick this up again later once you buy it. Its probably not content filled enough right now especially when it lacks complexity after you are regularly smelting

coolit	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020524272/	Raft is a fun game that needs a lot of updates. You start on a raft and for the first 10-20 minutes or so you are just basically playing a minigame of collect the ocean trash. After a bit you start getting a hang of the crafting system. 1 shark is always chasing you. You kill it and another one pops up about a minute later. You find islands and try collecting resources underwater, but the dang shark bites you everytime. An hour or two in you no longer worry about food or water because they are so easy to obtain and you have so many auto collection baskets on your raft you don't bother even hooking anything unless it is a barrel. At this point you are playing a raft building simulator.That is my initial impression at least. I assume there is some way to dive deeper or explore new things as the raft gets larger or something but that is unclear in game. Thankfully the game is very new and now that the developers have a slightly more steady cashflow from steam and their publisher I am hopeful the game will get a lot of attention and work. Despite Raft feeling a bit repetitive I would still recommend and will probably continue to play and follow its progress.
franktank9956	Recommended	16.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101492057/	Bought this game hoping to check it out before the two hour window, ended up playing 12.2 hours straight and didn't even know. The game plays smoothly. Only lag was when breaking down extremely large, unneeded structures. (Tallest thing on raft was 5 blocks other than random 100+ tall tower.) For only being out two days, I am pleased with the game. That being said, there is plenty that can be added to the game. Everything was researched within 4 hours of playing with one friend. Playing with someone else makes the game a lot more fun becasue you can each focus on different aspects to continue to expand your raft.
dom	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982574116/	A very nice survival game. I am looking forward to test the multiplayer.

Helikaon	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038484249/	I played this game with a friend and we had a blast for about 5 hours. It is a relatively short experience for 20 bucks but even so we had a great time and I'd say it was worth it. Hopefully they keep adding content as they have been, this game has a lot of potential.
AceBini	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053492455/	Neat game, living on the raft is fun but getting thirsty and hungry at unrealistic speeds is a pain to deal with. Not a bad game for twenty dollars especially if you have friends to play with.
Timbazi	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/timbazi/	You wake up on a small Raft, debris floating towards you. Gotta stay alive and build your Raft biggerRaft has gone a massive transformation since early-early development stages.So far, I've played only the single-player mode, but things are looking really good.The devs obviously understand what people mean with "Keep it simple." I would like to see some bigger islands, and maybe cave systems in them.Ratings: 1-10Graphics: 9 (Don't exactly know what it is but needs that tiny bit of extra"umph")Audio: 8 (There isn't really much of it but what you expect to hear in the middle of an ocean?)Gameplay: 8 (You'll understand once you play the game)Control: 10 (Nothing bad about the controls, everything works)Story: 2 (This is where the game falls short, there's nothing to the story except that you wake up on a Raft, hoping to see a story opening from like... a message in a bottle type of thing?)Content: 7 (Not much of it... yet.

annedl	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/annedl/	Good to play here and there but not a game you could spend a lot of time in.  Hopefully the future will bring more ontent.Collect materials, build tools, build your raft, attack sharks when they attack you or your raft, keep fed and hydrated.  That's basically the game.
Shalubadubub	Recommended	32.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/closet-furry/	Very fun game. Does get kinda grind-y after a while. I notice others have said that $20 is a bit much, but it seems like just the right price for this game. Things I like:1) SHARK2) Scrap Mechanic duck3) The incredibly hilarious animation of the seagull attacking your cropsThings I dont like (some may be bugs):1) I dont like that the shark attacks your raft, but i understand why its there.2) I understand that the game is about a raft (hence the name) but eventually you get to the point where your 'raft' is a boat, or even a ship! I feel more boat/shiplike building blocks would be great.3) I dont like the craft screen. The Scrap Mechanic spawn menu would work great here.4) If you've made it to this review im sure you've heard others mention that if you lose the raft, your screwed. This is true. Not sure how they're gonna fix this one.5) I dont like that you cant discover full on islands full of loot and stuff.6) I dont like that you need to have so many pillars in order to have an open room. It is realistic, but so is malaria, the flu, and pirates. And those would not make a good addition to the game. (maybe pirates)What I would change:1) add more tiers of items2) add more items (such as lore friendly diaries that you can find on other rafts floating about)3) add a map4) add an advanced raft foundation that would resemble that of a real boat.5) add interior doors that look just like household doors6) add a harpoon gun7) add whales and other fish to hunt with said harpoon gun8) give shark a hat9) add a volleyball with a face drawin on it  like this [cdn.images.express.co.uk] 
MagTheMercenary	Recommended	17.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/magthemercenary/	4 hours in and I'm loving the improvement over the Alpha version so far. Single-player is solid for the first few hours but once your raft expands, co-op is the ultimate way to go for the best experience.Few quirks I have to comment on would be how annoyingly fast your hunger and thirst levels deteriorate as well as the constant threat and presence of the shark during calm waves. Even after you kill one, the next one spawns in rather quick.Will update this review as I progress, as of now I definitely recommend playing this with some friends. It's like a cartoonish Stranded Deep in which I hope the devs never abandon updating it with more and more content as time goes on.Edit 1:So my friend and I finally reached the supposed end goal and it took us a grand total of about 13 hours plus minus. We honestly did not expect that shocking reveal we discovered.Overall it is definitely a fun game to play in co-op, singleplayer can get lonely and tiresome because you'll be repeating a lot of the same thing over and over again.However, there were some bugs we encountered throughout our 13-hour journey; the most jarring is when we want to drop items for one another and it ends up being suspended mid-air and cannot be picked up at all, essentially losing it. If it were common items it'd be fine but let's say you wanted to drop some food for your partner (20 cooked shark for example) and it ends up just disappearing right in front of you. Really frustrating at times because it happens at random.Speaking of dropping items, the devs definitely need to implement a way to drop a certain number of items instead of the entire stack. Something like splitting it in half or dropping 2 at a time rather than all 20. It's a minor improvement but it's helpful to have.Someone said this before and I agree fully, the shark respawn time is way too quick and it attacks far too often. I understand that it's probably a game mechanic whereby there's some form of threat to the player instead of just the hunger and thirst, but the shark really needs to cool it. Also, sometimes the shark just spawns and attacks our raft right smack in the middle rather than the usual edges (which makes more sense). This can be quite a serious issue if your raft has important items or structures placed in the middle, the antenna and receiver for example.So that's all from me, I will return to this game again once a new update drifts in but other than that I'm pretty much happy with how it turned out compared to the original Alpha version from itch.io. I do hope any and all added content will be compatible with existing save files. It'd be a shame to have to go through another set of long hours to rebuild.
DizzyFox	Recommended	23.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197992287404/	Amazing game, wonderful. Not much content atm, I completed all the tasks in about 6 hrs of playtime. But still, it's early of development.
Smoey	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982456724/	This game was designed my Redbeet intereactive and Axolot games (they make Scrap Mechanic) liked the look of it so much they picked up the publishing for it.Scrap mechanic is an amazing game and its influence can be seen though Raft. (check that once out)I have been playing though with a friend and the beginning was tough, with 2 or 3 people you double or even tripple your food demand and thats tough right off the hop. Building works as it should and as you would expect. We have a good sized raft and 24 nets across our spaceship themed raft. I have found everything works well and as it should. nothing game breaking has crossed my path yet.There is always something to do, or should I say there is always 3 things to do. Managing hunger thirst, shark attacks and resource gathering.  A game that's a lot of fun and I'm having a blast.On normal when you're 'killed' you're incapacitated and need to be carried to a bed by a team mate. this had lead to some INTENSE *I'm being chased up the stairs* feelings and I love it.Some things I have come across.1. Our raft is quite big, We cannot hear shark attacks on the other side of our raft. That audio should be tweaked, 2. Leaving a game you are not the host of and returning wipes inventory, have a chest set aside for logging off.    in 7 hours nor me or my friend was disconnected, not once. However I assume a disconnect would reset inventory of     non host players,  this should also be tweaked.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395160750https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395160892https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395160620https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1395160977 
RoastedSquirrel	Recommended	22.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118257103/	RAFT has come a long way since its release on ITCH.IO.  RAFT makes the grinding for resources enjoyable and relaxing unlike most survival games where resource collecting becomes a nuisance.  As of writing this review, I have just completed the game which only took about 8 hours.  I hope that the development of RAFT continues far into the future with more variety in it’s virtual world.  I don’t think it's worth the $20 at the moment, but I would definitely keep up to date with it’s development.  In conclusion, RAFT is on its way to becoming a great game.

However, there are a few buggy features that do need to be addressed such as loss of inventory when joining a friends world and occasionally if you drop an item it becomes impossible to pick it back up due to it  glitching out.

Shuffle - Cuck's New Groove	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shuffle_11/	Brilliant game. Almsot a mix of minecraft survival island/skyblock in the theory of gameplay but with a more realistic yet cartoony art style.The "boring parts" of the game would be the gathering of resources by hooking at floating items in the sea, yet this is almsot like it's own mini-game within itself. The game is more enjoyable with friends (especially with the hooking) and also gives a challenging survival if you don't have a system going of replensihing water/food and getting resources. Woudl recommend if you enjoy surivval games in general or if you were an old fan of minecraft survival worlds in the past. Improvements?- More items/ reosurces would be a good thing but i'm sure that is ont he "to do list" for development.- Toning down the amount of plastic/ making the amount of plastic that you gain form the sea less (I frequently found     plastic to be in abundance and i was tossing it overboard for more inv space/chest space).- The idea of creating more than 1 raft would also be cool so that you and your friends could have a raft each?- maybe a map so that you can colonise onto an island snd return to it later?TL;DR - Good game, survival game with an interesting new twist - very enjoyable. 
Beachbum3204	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198125585331/	For now, the game has a great chemistry with the survival gamer. Starting from scratch, to creating a massive raft with multiple different aspects is very appealing and enjoyable with the right group of freinds. I do hope that more will be put into the game. For instance, after playing for 4 hours straight, I couldnt help but feel a little bored that all I was doing was purifying water, cooking meat and collecting resources that were drifting in the water. The island system is nice, but I do hope that bigger islands could be made with hidden treasures and possible enemy threats throughout the world. The game runs great, and the developers did a phenominal job with the optimaztion. Cant wait to see what else they add!

Well, welcome to Raft. You wake up on a 1x1 raft in the middle of the ocean with nothing, and by nothing I was unable to get out of first person; i suspect my character was completely naked, so you start with absolutely nothing. Somehow the devs expect you to survive. Even before you start feeling comfortable by expanding your raft. There is this shark that has a personal vendeta against you. I mean no matter how far you travel, s/he has decided that your life MUST be ended.I highly suggest this game if you like survival exploratory games.

Branchminer1	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/branchminer1/	After playing the game mostly blind for 3.2 hours (accoring to Steam), I have to say: I love this game! Despite a few minor issues--such as framerate drops, no fullscreen toggle, no FOV toggle, and some confusing gameplay mechanics--I thoroughly enoyed the experience.For those who are considering purchasing this game, here is a summarization:     You play on a small raft in the middle of an endlessly generated ocean, and your mission is to survive by using your grappling hook to reel in junk passing by in the water. From there the game is about building up your raft, researching new crafting recipes, and trying to defend yourself against the ever-present shark that stalks your raft throughout the game and occasionally attempts to take a bite out of it.Some things that I particularily liked about the game are: . The crafting system. Once you figure out how to work it, it's really good. . The research system. No blueprints? Just stick a piece of wood or plastic into the thing and discover a plethora of new crafting recipes! . The artstyle. What can I say? Beautiful water, items, and creatures. . The random events. The islands, abandoned rafts, and natural phenomena give a sense of life to the world, and the chance that the shark will attack your raft keeps you on edge. . The music. If you've played Minecraft, then the relaxing orchestra hailing the dawn or wardning of the night will give you a sense of familiarity. . The sound design. All the sound effects are a bliss to listen to. . The hand gestures. This is by far my favorite cosmetic feature, and watching my character give a thumbs-up whenever I build something tickles my soul. . And of course, the building. I've built one staircase, and I'm already in love with the designing element in this game. I can't even imagine the possibilities once I unlock more items and raft parts.And now, some things I don't like are: . The field of vision. There is no way to change the FOV, and on top of being extremely unsatisfying, it constantly causes my to misjudge distance when throwing my hook. . The item durability. While durability is well-balanced on most of the tools, a few key ones break much to quickly for how much I'm constantly using them (the spear and paddle in particular). . The lack of a fullscreen toggle. What the game doesn't tell you is that it's constantly running in window mode unless you choose to launch it in full screen. . The lack of a pause function. Seriously, bringing up the menu doesn't pause the game. . The lack of a method by which you can change the rotation of the raft. . The general emptiness of the word. The islands and rafts are really the only difference in the environment this game has to offer; otherwise, you spend your days staring at the endless ocean, and, despite it's beautiful graphics, you still get tired of it after a while.Now, take what I say with a grain of salt, as the game has literally come out a few days ago, and all of my major criticisms are likely to be fixed. Plus, i still had an insane amount of fun during the three hours I played, and even though I'm not sure the game is worth twenty bucks as it is, I am more than confident that it will outgrow that price as it is updated. Still, your decision, your money; do with it what you want.In conclusion, I, Branch, highly recommend this game to you.

toast	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/affx/	Do I recommend the game? YesIs it worth the money? Not really (CURRENTLY)(The game is well-optimised and runs very well, to be expected seen as its a pretty simple game)This game is fun, don't get me wrong, especially with friends when they fall in the water and struggle to get back on the ship because the sails are picking up wind, it can be hilarious but the issue is that the game doesn't particularly feel replayable. Not to mention when you're getting towards the end of crafting recipes, you're literally sat there for a long period of time just waiting for resources such as metal.My advice would be if this is a game you're wanting to spend your money on but you're unsure, i'd hold off until a later point when there is more content to the game.
|U.B.C.S| LoneTuber	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xxlonewolfxx12345/	My brother and I Purchased yesterday (got the 20% discount assuming for owning Scrap Mech?), We managed to get in just over two hours of play, we were a bit sceptical at first like many however after a few deaths and some learning we ended up being extremely engrossed in this game but unfortunately sleep was needed due to work the next day so was forced to stop.The game play is fun and keeps you on your toes (or on your raft) with the sharks, there seems to be plenty of things to craft although I have not managed to craft everything yet.I do however think perhaps there should be more rafts or wrecks to obtain supplies from and less drifting as although I know the ocean is full of rubbish, the amount passing by seems to be rather a lot.The islands need to have a shoreline and not be a mountain styled thing you have to build stairs to get onto along with being bigger.Not sure if it is just because I have rubbish gear but I do see that hunger goes down very very fast and water seems to be reasonable slow so I do think some balancing needs doing on this part as I think this needs to be the other way around due to water being the main requirement of our bodies.Graphics! What can I say but awesome, if you crank the settings to max you will have a brilliant experience and it does not even require much of a powerhouse as I only have a 1050ti 4GB (I was also using Steam Streaming over wi-Fi on host and client).Not quite sure why some people are giving poor reviews due to them dying or unable to get something as this to me just seems like they are incapable of learning how to play the game as it cannot be much more straightforward, the menu systems are clear and easy to navigate, I have not once since playing looked under controls in options as its got your standard survival setup.There are however things I would add/change but obviously this would be why the game is in EA so I look forward to what the future of this game holds especially seeing the amount of sales this game has already produced.

Multiplayer is extremely buggy. Two players is alright, but any more and the game will bug out frequently. Aside from the shark, food and water, there aren't too many challenges.Aside from those, a really amazing game! Loads of fun and I highly recommend buying it!

The game has grown so much from itch.io but it has some bugs and i think they need to add more uses for brick just little things like that. i also think they should add a better shark bait that you could pick up or poison the shark for some of its health. Over all its a great game and im hooked to the game.
Determination	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Blueshirt/	This is a fun game, a nice new experience and a bit casual for busier people like me and not overpriced too badly (it should be with more content and gameplay systems though). You start out struggling to survive and in an hour or two you achieve a point where you're established in food, water and basic resource harvesting (wood and scrap primarily). At which point you sort of do what you like.In its current state its playable and fun, but underdeveloped for content and has its problems (early access duh). If the games satisfies all these issues below its perfectly suited for its price of £15 and even possibly worth more than that. Its current frustrations to me mainly are:A distinct lack of pathing/collisions for the shark and birds. They dont play by the rules you do and are annoying/unfair for clipping through your raft and the island.A lack of physics in general. Rafts not damaging on collision with islands, sails not turning the ship when they're placed off centre and a general lack of need to not change your ship from just being a floating island with random stuff strewn across it. And as far as I can tell being able to build it as top heavy as you like.Seeds, my reccomendation is to take a "Oxygen not Included" approach to seeds. You harvest the plant and you automatically replant a new one, then keep current seed drop rates or make them rarer. You're already wasting time/resources on chasing seagulls and buildings scarecrows or axes, not being able to 'keep progress' is a bummer. Especially when food is a non issue with fishing. Scarecrows not being repairable with wood or plastic is really annoying for some reason, I cant figure out why but probably something to do with not really fixing the problem.Upgraded tools. These dont really feel like upgrades, the durability rise doesnt provide more value than the consumption of metal and scrap. I'd reccomend them having durability but being repairable with plastic/wood or at least being able to keep some of the metal from making them when they break. Its better to make the armoured platforms than the metal spear especially as the worst culprit. The one exception is the upgraded hook, but I only use that for scuba scavenging so that is still wasted potential really. An upgraded axe feels disctinctly missing. This problem applies to the equipment like flippers and oxygen bottles too, they could use upgrades, but they feel like a waste of vinegoo especially when shark bait doesnt have an upgrade either.Inventory management. Its so easily cluttered and I find its easy to accumulate junk resources. A button and filter to throw unwanted items overboard, more uses for junk items (mid/end game), these being the veggie drops, rocks and plastic. (Plastic is especially frustrating, I want to keep it because you build with it, but it just isn't as useful as wood)A lack of danger. This is funny when you consider there is a shark stalking you 24/7 that never seems to starve to death but still disctinctly acts like you're its only food source rather than all the fish everywhere. But a basic need for shade from the sun would really help encourage building rafts as homes rather than a project after you're 'established'. But being isolated out on the ocean should mean storms or sun all day should both come up with their own threats to you that you need to build around.A lack of content. I know this is planned anyway, but I do agree if the price bothers you and you might not pick this up again later once you buy it. Its probably not content filled enough right now especially when it lacks complexity after you are regularly smelting
クトリ・ノタ・セ Music	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cherprangareekul_bnk48/	Great Game
coolit	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020524272/	Raft is a fun game that needs a lot of updates. You start on a raft and for the first 10-20 minutes or so you are just basically playing a minigame of collect the ocean trash. After a bit you start getting a hang of the crafting system. 1 shark is always chasing you. You kill it and another one pops up about a minute later. You find islands and try collecting resources underwater, but the dang shark bites you everytime. An hour or two in you no longer worry about food or water because they are so easy to obtain and you have so many auto collection baskets on your raft you don't bother even hooking anything unless it is a barrel. At this point you are playing a raft building simulator.That is my initial impression at least. I assume there is some way to dive deeper or explore new things as the raft gets larger or something but that is unclear in game. Thankfully the game is very new and now that the developers have a slightly more steady cashflow from steam and their publisher I am hopeful the game will get a lot of attention and work. Despite Raft feeling a bit repetitive I would still recommend and will probably continue to play and follow its progress.
franktank9956	Recommended	16.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198101492057/	Bought this game hoping to check it out before the two hour window, ended up playing 12.2 hours straight and didn't even know. The game plays smoothly. Only lag was when breaking down extremely large, unneeded structures. (Tallest thing on raft was 5 blocks other than random 100+ tall tower.) For only being out two days, I am pleased with the game. That being said, there is plenty that can be added to the game. Everything was researched within 4 hours of playing with one friend. Playing with someone else makes the game a lot more fun becasue you can each focus on different aspects to continue to expand your raft.
dom	Recommended	10.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197982574116/	A very nice survival game. I am looking forward to test the multiplayer.
Valhala	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/koketsu/	This game is a LOT of fun.
Helikaon	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038484249/	I played this game with a friend and we had a blast for about 5 hours. It is a relatively short experience for 20 bucks but even so we had a great time and I'd say it was worth it. Hopefully they keep adding content as they have been, this game has a lot of potential.

fuzzlepan	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198283203741/	This game is amazing, the graphics are so good, i cant even explain how good the gameplay is. i really recommend you get this game!
GunnaGecka	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rainbowsix4life/	Hello developers I really hope you see this and consider my changes to the game, ive played this game for about 8 hours and I love it. Id give this game a 4.5 out of 5 and ill tell you my changes from most important to least important.1. Obviously add more things to the game but it is a fairly new game so I wouldn't judge it that way, because there are most likely going to be many updates.2.When you start a game and play with your friends I think you should be able to give privlages to your friends so they can play on your game even when your not on. This is because I hate it when my friends want to play and I can't just because Im not on it really sucks that they can't play so please please add that.3. I wish there were bigger islands, more of them, and iconic structures places on the map.4. Overall just add upgrades to the items like maybe a better shark bait that is made of salmon and other big fish that lasts 2 to 3 times longer, and maybe a repair system for tools. Thank you and maybe consider these things. I will gladely suport your game and report any bugs and do these every once and a while.
Cavalier Crusader	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cavalier_Crusader/	Me and 2 Friends had a lot of fun playing through this game. We researched everything and ventured to the radio signal in a little under 7 hrs. The game in it's current state is not worth $20 as it doesn't have enough content but, it's still enjoyable. Me and my friends still have plenty of stuff to do to our raft, paint it, add more stories, put decorations on it, etc... I bought this game knowing it wouldn't be full of content but, I believe the Devs will continue to make massive updates and better the game (The radio signal proves this).
BasketofCheese	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075555292/	TL:DR: Raft is awesome. Buy it, especially if you have friends to play it with. Solo is still extremely fun and relaxing too. I'd give it an 8.5/10 if I had to give it a number.I've been playing Raft for about a year now on and off (mainly off) from the prototype on itch.io. Once I saw the game was released I immediately purchased thinking "how much could they have added"? The answer is alot. The basic premise of Raft is that you're dropped in the middle of the ocean on 4 planks, which is barely enough space to even move. As you float along however you find floating trash all around you that you can collect and expand your raft. At first it will be little things necessary for survival, but as the game goes on you can make your own little mansion if you set your heart to it. Being a survival game you also have manage hunger, thirst, health, as well as last through the lonely nights and storms. Of course there are sharks too, so you have to be extra careful when you go into the water to grab some supplies. The grind isn't terrible and feels pretty rewarding as you make a bigger and bigger boat. The survival elements tend to be more of an obstacle than an annoyance. It sucks when you're trying to collect a number of barrels, kill the shark tearing up your boat, and board an abandoned raft for its roof while moving at 50% because you're low on food. It's a slow game but if you're not paying attention then you can miss everything. Raft is an amazing game that feels great to play and that will hopefully be updated more. I was surprised to see multiplayer was added, which is awesome and works great. I'm excited to see where the updates takes the game as it seems like there is endless potential.  There is also a creative mode so you can see just how big these rafts can get.Now that I've said everything I like about the game here are a few suggestion that will make the game even crazier in my opinion. I'll edit if these things get added or if I find out that they've been added:1. Pirates - there are already abandoned rafts within the world with loot to get. What if there was a survivor or group of survivors who try to raid your raft forcing you to fight them off?2. Multiplayer Battle - I don't want to call it a battle royale, but maybe something similar to Arma 3 survival or DayZ. You spawn in a server in a random spot and begin collecting tools and whatnot only to find a player out on the water. You can then fight that enemy for their boat and supplies, or even befriend them.  The developers are already heading in the right direction with this idea as they have added friendly fire in multiplayer, but without servers setup for raiding this won't be in the game for awhile.3. Oil Spills / Shipwrecks - I read about this in another post, but someone on a forum was saying that the ocean is too clean and there should be things like oil spills and wrecked ships. (There might be wrecked ships but I haven't come across one yet so I'll change this if I find it.)4.  Monsters - They have the sharks, but in the endgame it can become so much worse. I'm not trying to steal from Sea of Thieves, but the Kraken is a great idea and things like this should be implemented so people with mansion-like rafts have something to contest. Some other ideas for monsters could be something Mermaids, A sea variation of Nessie, a giant lion turtle (Avatar: The Last Airbender is a perfect show), and white whale like Moby♥♥♥♥♥♥These are just a few suggestion that seemed interesting to me. The developers have said they are already have ideas in the works, so I'm excited. Can't wait to explore the world more this weekend and see how it grows over the next few months.
Comets2224	Recommended	16.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308462060/	Raft is a great game! The idea is very nice and I like the way the game was built. Theres so much to build and create even at this early access stage, me and my friends love to create huge ships or just play the normal survival mode. If you like construction, adventure and eastereggs, this is the game for you.
Robert Draven Jr	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198174945882/	solid game! main thing is just to add more content - but im sure the devs know that already!ideas include - more animals in the sea, more customization for the characters etc :) excited to see what the future brings
White Squall	Recommended	25.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010386277/	Wow, what can i say about this game that hasnt already been raved about? I have just about 6 hours in this game, and that was all in one sitting. If you can, play it with friends, the experience is far greater for it.    now for the review:The Game:this is a survival game about surviving the open ocean, I wont go further than that, the trailer shows it well enough. It has a heavy focus so far, on one resource i havent seen in other survival games; your attention.playing Alone isnt just hard, its for the pros. i survived alone for about an hour on my second try before my friends joined in, and i was about ready to smash my computer. its very easy to become overwhelmed by everything happening in the backround. ( food, hunger, the need to stop on an island, the constant current, the F***ing shark....) So where does your attention come in? Well, every so often, the shark (my friends an i affectionately named "Shannon" after a friend, yea that got awkward when we started mounting her head.... lol) will swim by and take a chunk off your boat. or at least try to. you gotta stab it 3 - 5 times with a spear to stop it. you have to be vigilant for it, lest it take apart your raft or the most important pieces. ( ive had that POS take 3 collection nets in a row. THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE DAMMIT!) later when you have crop plots, problem number 2 shows up. the seagull. the seagull will attempt to steal your food, so in addition to your survival stats (food/water) you need to watch for the shark and seagull. your attention in this game is demanded of you. i realize i havent said much to sell the game to you. but honestly, its amazing. my friends and i all had work in the morning, and we couldnt stop ourselves from playing till 1 AM. every hour one of us would say "wow its X oclock" and be met with a group "wow damn..." and then we kept playing. if you get a group of friends together, this game is pure fun. if youre alone, this game is a worthy challenge.*this review was written from the standpoint of a player using Normal difficulty*

456qwejos	Recommended	27.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/456qwejos/	Raft is a great unique game that satisfies the mindset of many players as it includes: action, adeventure, creativity aswell as being relaxing (when the shark is not attacking your raft and you are not dieing of hunger.) Great game, many items. While at this point I have only played it for 1.4 hrs I have seen many videos on it and know I will enjoy it soo much.
Tigerking385	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tigerking385/	It's like if Subnautica and Stranded Deep had a baby but the baby knew how to create multiplayer
Detective Geralt	Recommended	10.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057835781/	You catch catfish from the ocean in this game. 10/10
aercher_28	Recommended	34.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198083043771/	Good game only one complaint there should be a tiller to control thedirection of the raft or what side the raft is facing
Turmoil	Recommended	6.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Turmoil90/	After playing this game with a group of 3 players I must say it's probably too easy for groups. Once the initial problem of food and water are addressed and the group has a constant stream of supplies it's really just a waiting game to build things. Even the shark in this game poses no danger to the point where we would actively throw ourselvs into the water just to fight it for entertainment.From a single player standpoint I think it would be much more challenging to keep up with the demands of survival but as it stands a coordinated group trivializes the game.Things I would like to see. More random events, storms, hurricanes, shark schools, anything to add difficulty to groups. There needs to be more end-game as well. Is it worth the $20? I would say if you like survival games and have a group to play with then yes it's definitely worth it. In its current state I would not play it solo but thats just because I believe the added players add something to the game.
Roadworrieor	Recommended	20.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Roadworrieor/	Very fun, but lacks stuff to do. I completed the game in under 2 hours. I ran out of stuff to do and just started building which got boring fast.
DOOVEY	Recommended	25.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198215694777/	This is a great game. Very addictive and extremley fun. I wish there were more threats other than the shark and that there were more variants to the islands. For example a giant squid and or shark frenzy and island types that are flat and much larger.
big idiot	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DRILLY/	So far ive played this game a lil bit and i must say that this game can be very challenging and fun! i love this game there are so many thngs to do and many things you must do to survive. once i started up the game the main menu gave me a stranded deep vibe which i liked alot. i highly recommend this game if your into stranded deep or the forest, the survival part atleast!! AND its multiplayer!!!! 10/10 would buy again for twice the price!!!! cant wait to see what the devs have for us.
MeatSauce	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Malleboy/	This game is very good. Its fun alone and with friends
[x] Dark Duck	Recommended	128.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017591292/	Realy nice game ! You have to survive and make a bigger and more complex Raft. You need to get enouth resources to do it and sometimes your life is in danger cause of that. For me the only bad thing is that when you do all the things that you have to it get boring. The game needs more things to do. Since is early access i am w8ing and hoping to see a lot more in this game that will make it more interesting.Lets survive in a world full of WaTeR !
Subzero	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198328766702/	Raft, a wonderful oceanic survival type game with lots of potential. There are still a few bugs and not many features added as of yet but this game has much potential if the project is not abandoned, I would recommend it to anyone who likes survival type games.Pros- Ocean survival, not many games like it.- Decent building mechanics and pretty good graphics imo.Cons- Annoying sharks destroying everything.- Islands don't spawn very often.Things to add?- Add like a mining system so when you go on these islands you can get stones and ores and whatnot, adds a whole level of playability including getting better tools, adding a forge or some sort of option like that.- Make the random islands larger and maybe add some sort of animal or mob on the islands, remove the shark maybe and replace it with something else?
iAmTaooo	Recommended	8.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198308541740/	========== pro ========== game is not buggy for early access unlimited building on raft.  genuinely a fun challenge.========== con ========== $$$ Too pricey for early access. Probably should get the game during sales. A lot to do in the beginning, very little later on. Difficult in the beginning, very easy in the late game. Which seems weird. Too short. Take 6 hours to complete the game and I am not pro. A bit laggy and requires a somewhat decent gpu.I got the game to mainly support the idea of it. Moreover, it is cool to get a feel of the game at its beginning stage. Axolot games will also update the game almost at a weekly / bi-weekly basis like how they update their other game, Scrap Mechanic.  So I'm sure there is more to the game on the way.
BKcam	Recommended	26.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052086319/	Awesome game just needs more content. I would like to see the addition of caves, speargun, fish that you can spear, a trolling net for fish, diving cage that mounts to raft and can drop down below safe from sharks, bigger islands with animals like monkeys you could tame as a pet that could have an ability like pooping and you can fertilize crops for higher yield, building multiple rafts on the same server, being able to build on islands, hidden treasure chests that you can search for using a map, jet skis + wakeboard, kites you can fly, some musical instruments to play with friends, mini submarine that can dock on the raft, maybe a boss battle like a kraken, a shovel to dig up resources on the islands and the addition of beaches, minigames to play with friends like paddleball or a small soccer net and ball... just some things off the top of my head. Some of them may seem like a bit much but we need creative ideas to keep the game fun.A couple things I think could be changed/fixed - be able to collect water from the collection net, add the ability to repair tools (mat cost doesn't need to be reduced),
Demasis	Recommended	89.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Demasis/	I remember more than a year ago when I stumbled upon this freeware game, I absolutely fell in love with it!I bought this game the hour it was released!I wish the game had some more dynamics that could make the game more interesting during multiplayer and also story-line wise.Thoughts I had playing the new releaseDozens of messages in bottles that float down gradually explaining the story-line (non-inventory burdening)Multiplayer features where someone can take control of a 2nd shark to bite you in the water or destroy the ship.Tier 2 raft objects for everything that makes them sturdierScrap metal barbed wire lining for Anti-shark around the raft. Thank you to everyone developing this game and keep up the good work!
Trashboat	Recommended	3.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrtrashboat/	Don't make any judgements about this game before you buy it. I know it says "Early Access", and "Survival" in the tags, but this one... this one is different. This game has so much potential. I find little to no bugs in the gameplay, making the experience even better albeit unfinished. It's great in singleplayer, and 4 man co-op makes the game more interesting.
meeksorad	Recommended	27.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165259256/	This game is amazing! I do think that $20 is a bit much but if they continue updating it then it will be totally worth it. It does need more in it though. My thoughts on some additions:Motor: To move against the wind and move faster.Description: For when a sail is just not enough.Map: To see where you have been within 10k meters.Description: Explore the unknown with renewed vigor!Gunpowder: Made from sand and rock(Change it how you will.)Description: Used to make something powerful!Pistol: Able to shoot the shark at longer ranges.Description:  For when a spear is just not enough!Rifle: Able to shoot the shark at even longer ranges.Description: Able to shoot enemies from long distances.Scrap Foundation: Stronger foundation than normal wood one.Description:  Sharks will have a tough time chewing through this!Foundation spikes: They stab the shark when he tries to eat them. (Maybe has two durability? Two shark attacks?)Description:  Stop them from even getting close.Tiller: Turns your boat around. After getting hit by a island or ghost boat.Description:  Able to turn your boat around.Harpoon gun: Shoots a hook at extreme distances. Able to hook onto the ghost boats and pull you it closer to you.Description:  Able to reach the farthest loot and boats.I will update this at a later time. I hope you enjoyed my suggestions!

WarChallenger	Recommended	37.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205374768/	I definitely have to say that I recommend this game for others to use.  Although some parts need improvement such as how the shark can suddenly attack any random panel on larger craft, I quickly became so addicted to the build mechanics of this game that I decided to make a Nimitz Class carrier out of my raft, and so far it seems to work well.  Overall the gameplay is great, except I wish you good luck in finding enough scrap metal to really make the foundation armor.
Squidmeister	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/squidmeister2/	Unique and different from other survival games, but (I know it's in early access) it needs to be optimised better (dosn't run the best) and they need to add a FOV slider. The default FOV is pretty small for MY standards. And so far I've only played singleplayer and I like it, so i'd imagine it'd be much more fun if played multiplayer.
..STL..	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/stellhost/	Mult mai bun decat precedentul
Luqe	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/listentoluqe/	not bad at all, very colorful. yet color does not play a major role in this game. 5 star colorblind friendly game. however, like any other survival game, it is very repetitive and tiring. still, would recommend this game for survival gamers.
Janitak	Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042363338/	A good game but unless you have a beefy computer, I'd wait to buy it. Hopefully updates will improve its performance.
One-Eyed Nick	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/surkrem/	Raft (as of 12/06/2018) has a fairly strong foundation.What the game needs is more enemy types for players who have found the rig, more items to research and new resources that only players who have reached the rig can collect/refine.Development seems to be somewhat active since there has already been at least one patch sine the last time I played (patch 1.02, which added bows and arrows and a much-needed FOV slider).If you have some disposable income, then throwing it at Redbeet Interactive (the developers of raft) wouldn't be a bad idea. The game is however not complete and there's no guarantee that it will ever be. Because of that, I cant recommend this for most people unless you're certain you'll get your money's worth.
BlaizeRay	Recommended	37.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/captainblaizeray/	This game is the best game I’ve played in a while, ranking right up there with Subnautica. It is a bit laggy, but the extremely engaging gameplay completely makes up for it. As I’m writing this, Raft is still in early access and has only been out for a week, but it it has minimal bugs and the multiplayer works great! Keep up the good work!
Pavalon	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Pavalon1337/	Fun game, very polished for early acsess.All this game needs now is a proper end game goal.Perhaps some random events and missions.
123	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198166116903/	Very fun and relaxing! But I think if they want you to play more than 50 hours, they need to do something, because I think I will get bored eventually. There is also some problems that they should fix, getting stuck in nets on your raft and that only one person can be in the same storage box at the same time.
dimitri_2018@hotmail.ru	Recommended	19.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tf2isbad/	first of all , its worth it.this game is so much fun like the alpha version maybe boring but this version add so many things.also there is multiplayer and playing with friends is insanely fun. 
A Land Down Under	Recommended	16.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198106238799/	This game is probably one of my favorite games I've bought in the last year or so. I love all the mechanics with the shark and the way of getting resources with a hook is a really good idea. My only complaint, as someone who loves multiplayer experiences, is that when your on a world with someone else you can't keep your items after disconnecting from the server and lose anything you log off with. Hopefully the devs fix this but other than that I definetly recommend you buy this game it has so many places to go and is looking good!
toast	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/affx/	Do I recommend the game? YesIs it worth the money? Not really (CURRENTLY)(The game is well-optimised and runs very well, to be expected seen as its a pretty simple game)This game is fun, don't get me wrong, especially with friends when they fall in the water and struggle to get back on the ship because the sails are picking up wind, it can be hilarious but the issue is that the game doesn't particularly feel replayable. Not to mention when you're getting towards the end of crafting recipes, you're literally sat there for a long period of time just waiting for resources such as metal.My advice would be if this is a game you're wanting to spend your money on but you're unsure, i'd hold off until a later point when there is more content to the game.
Tinfish	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006708192/	The island I was on disappeared and I was let floating in the sea.  I swam towards a floating building then that disappeared too.  Still like the concept.  Hope it improves.4 hrs Update - ok so I was so wrong!  You have to stay on raft and stick with it.  i.e you cannot get off and try to start on an island at the beginnig.   It's like jumping off the bus, and trying to run after it and get back on.  You have to stay with your raft.... and it's not a bad thing.The trick is to steer your raft and use the current to get 'stuck' on an island and as quickly as you can, remove all the resources from on and under!  Nets on front of raft help to collect resources great idea after initial scramble to pickup everything you can.Great game - ongoing.
Skecilia	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SexySKuRnn/	Yes. I don't do much of reviews but this game. Yes.I play this game alone atm but its fun too.You start with a 2 by 2 platform and its very hard on Normal alone.I've started several worlds already just to get started to get the hang off it.Its very hard to get materials but at the same time very simple.Sometimes you'll get that much wood that you'll think you'll never need it,But then there is a storm or then there is litterally nothing in the ocean that all that wood you spent on gathering is gone and your thrist and hunger is depleted.In this game Wood is the aspect of life.You need wood to get water.You need wood to build and repair.You need wood to make stuff.You need wood to get food.Everything is wood even though everything is water.The cons of this game are :+ Another aspect of surivalism that will get you hooked if you played minecraft for a lifetime.+ There is friendly fire if your on multiplayer.+ there are islands and Abandoned Rafts to loot from.+ sharks hurt so beware off it which is good.+ Calendar to keep track of your days.+ realistic weather system (for example : The boat goes where the wind goes)+ you can actually swim underwater alone or with friends. Cause alone you'll use an anchor to make the boat still.Or with friends you can move it so you don't need to go the whole way back.-+ I should buy it if you don't like it however you can still refund it on steam refund but, 2 hours is the max amount of gameplay. So play it for 1 hour and see for yourself ( you can set the 1 hour on your phone ( android or Iphone doesn't matter ) )- No lore (might be for the future)- If you play solo you have the feeling your missing someone or something- Sometimes you'll get almost out of the boat if your opening a door but you'll not fall off.- I think we need some npc's in the solo world or even in the mp world.

fckshoes	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198451891538/	This is a fantastic early access game as is.  The only thing that would make this even better, would be to add larger islands to explore with more "enemies" other than a stalking shark.  Weather patterns, graphics, sounds and mechanics are all great.  Hope to see many updates for this game.

Lady Kianna	Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyKianna/	Very good game. Been watching a few videos and finally picked this up.We NEED a pause button though, or even better auto pause when opening the main menu or tabbing out. Easy mode should also have less shark. (I'm a filthy casual XD) I'm having a hard time with him I can't imagine how bad normal/hard modes would be.  More sea creatures? Octopus maybe?  Alternate rope recipe using kelp.

RoastedSquirrel	Recommended	22.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118257103/	RAFT has come a long way since its release on ITCH.IO.  RAFT makes the grinding for resources enjoyable and relaxing unlike most survival games where resource collecting becomes a nuisance.  As of writing this review, I have just completed the game which only took about 8 hours.  I hope that the development of RAFT continues far into the future with more variety in it’s virtual world.  I don’t think it's worth the $20 at the moment, but I would definitely keep up to date with it’s development.  In conclusion, RAFT is on its way to becoming a great game.

✦ Valicy ✦	Recommended	38.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Valicy/	Hey there i have some good and bad points on Raft if u agree with me like it thankspro:-just everything performance quality ... i love the gamecon:-no crouching-no voice chat-no ladders (or something like that) to build on islands-no FOV optionsbugs: i only found one bug its when u swim on a island u can get stuck inn the island from the wavesThanks for reading and keep playing that awesome game
One-Eyed Nick	Recommended	13.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/surkrem/	Raft (as of 12/06/2018) has a fairly strong foundation.What the game needs is more enemy types for players who have found the rig, more items to research and new resources that only players who have reached the rig can collect/refine.Development seems to be somewhat active since there has already been at least one patch sine the last time I played (patch 1.02, which added bows and arrows and a much-needed FOV slider).If you have some disposable income, then throwing it at Redbeet Interactive (the developers of raft) wouldn't be a bad idea. The game is however not complete and there's no guarantee that it will ever be. Because of that, I cant recommend this for most people unless you're certain you'll get your money's worth.
The Endleader	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028273763/	SEAGULL! SHARK! KILL EM ALL! Keep the updates coming! 8.5/11
Chaddius Thunderloins	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963758560/	Pretty fun for around 10 hours, but then it get's kinda tedious. Gameplay is very intuitive and easy to learn. Simple and fun, but lacks content for longer play at the moment.
BlaizeRay	Recommended	37.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/captainblaizeray/	This game is the best game I’ve played in a while, ranking right up there with Subnautica. It is a bit laggy, but the extremely engaging gameplay completely makes up for it. As I’m writing this, Raft is still in early access and has only been out for a week, but it it has minimal bugs and the multiplayer works great! Keep up the good work!
WarChallenger	Recommended	37.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205374768/	I definitely have to say that I recommend this game for others to use.  Although some parts need improvement such as how the shark can suddenly attack any random panel on larger craft, I quickly became so addicted to the build mechanics of this game that I decided to make a Nimitz Class carrier out of my raft, and so far it seems to work well.  Overall the gameplay is great, except I wish you good luck in finding enough scrap metal to really make the foundation armor.
Nat	Recommended	16.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/psychological1337/	It's better with friends with 10hrs worth of content for just $20. We like to get drunk, play sea shandys, and have an awesome night.
Squidmeister	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/squidmeister2/	Unique and different from other survival games, but (I know it's in early access) it needs to be optimised better (dosn't run the best) and they need to add a FOV slider. The default FOV is pretty small for MY standards. And so far I've only played singleplayer and I like it, so i'd imagine it'd be much more fun if played multiplayer.
R O S H I	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sceptrawr/	Very playable and doesn't really have any game breaking bugs like other early access titles. The game has potential to be great once more content is added.Pros: - Not a singleplayer ocean survival game. (Though you have the option to play alone.)Cons: - No FOV option. 
chinadoll20	Recommended	86.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057634734/	I'm having a real blast with this game, building my house boat, sailing the sea's, hoping I have enough stone to make a bucket ancher so I can stop at the islands to gather what I need, while all the time fending off that big shark and pesky gulls.                                                                                                                                                                                          The game runs well, a few FPS drop now and then nothing game breaking, its looks beautiful.Adding a survivor stranded at sea, who you can recruit and give commands like, fend off shark, repair, garden or just have someone to potter about for us solo players would be nice (Optinal ofcouse), Other rafters who maybe you can trade with etc, pirates,  new encounters, occtopus attack, piranha, storm damage to raft etc, I know animals are being added that you can tame, so cant wait for that.                                                                                                                                                                             This game is a breath of fresh air to the genere it has so much potential, I'm giving this tittle a big thumbs up, and hope it becomes a big tittle.
TLK95	Recommended	7.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198063890978/	It's a fun game with friends, would never play this alone.

sidΞWay	Not Recommended	25.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024168202/	Game feels way too easy. The first 4 hours are amazing, you can really feel the struggle of staying alive. Sadly, after that it suffers from your typical survival game problems. You already have almost everything, food and water are no longer a problem and the shark can't really kill you. Your raft is indestructable, no storm can damage it and collisions with the islands do nothing.Keeping thirst and hunger away is simply not enough, I'd say this game needs some kind of sickness mechanics, if you swim in the cold water or you have no roof over your head in the storm. Raft could get damaged in the storm as well, that would make the weather your biggest enemy.Great idea, but it would benefit greatly from improved multiplayer and additional challenges. There is no "Endgame" and you can't "win", unlike Subnautica for example.I can't say I'd recommend the game in it's current form. I know it's an early access, but it needs A LOT of content to be enjoyable for more than a day.I will continue to monitor the updates, hoping we'll soon have a reason to actually get this "Survive for 30 days" achievement.
☭ Big Base ☭	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CheatsAndYouKnow/	much shark good game, died
SlipperyJade	Recommended	12.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198154209426/	It puts a nice positive spin on minecraft because it's not minecraft but it keeps the open world sandbox theme to the game. It is getting constant updates and most of those are coming from community recommendations so this game definitely does it right when they add content that gamers want. I'd rate this game a 8/10 and probably a 9/10 if it still wasn't in early release. There are still bugs in this and still work that needs to be done on the game but for what it is currently it is fantastic and definitely a must play with friends. It is definitely a relaxing game and very cool to play... starting out is pretty rough but once you get started building your raft out the game becomes very addicting...

Thos Beans	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ReignOfRatch/	Poked a shark to deathI rate it at 7/10 pokes.this game is pretty relaxing and exciting at the same time. It can be a bit difficult to understand at first. Learning is a big part of the game. It took me a long time to realize you can dive to collect items that are needed in order to build some of the more advanced items. There is definitely a strategy for what to build in order, though I never got close to that point. $20 is kind of pushing it on how much it is worth. If it went on sale for $10, I would purchase it. I can definitely see myself playing it again later and sinking ~50 hours into it over its life.
ANTHONY MARS_	Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/absoluteuphoria/	I ate my friend's shark meat and he can't do anything about it ahahahahaha 10/10.
fallonfireblade	Recommended	99.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127397754/	Okay, I LOVE this game. I saw a few people's reviews who were like "Yeah? Well I 'beat it' in like 5 hours and then that was it, though it is 'nifty.'" I would like to say that that sort of review for this kind of game quite frankly makes no sense. You have to survive CONSTANTLY. Yes, you may find the secret "end game content" but that's not really beating it. Even if you do find that, I would say possibly more than 75% of this game is about the BUILDING. Yes, you've managed to survive. But can you SURVIVE. Are you living on a completely self sustaining raft? Do you have the giant raft mansion you want? Did you build your ENTIRE TOWN for any survivors that you may run across that may even help you to repopulate the earth? Well, if you're saying "I already beat it, it's over," then no. No you haven't. Not only do you get to have some of the combat element, but you can build basically whatever you can imagine. Make the KING of all rafts and show it off to all your friends. Don't take this platform for granted.

Bearded Cheg	Recommended	41.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/beardedcheg/	Hello everyone!This is one of the most chill and new player friendly survival games on the market. It's also very bright and does not give you an injection of anxiety. Progression and learning curve are perfectly set, you feel like you are learning with each hour played. The end game, when the game launched, was lacking a lot, and you would feel kind of sad for not having more of it. However, to my surprise, they are still adding content, and its more and more fun. It might seen overpriced, but I'm telling you, you will squeeze 100s of hours from this one, especially with friends!

ethan	Recommended	38.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ETHN01/	Raft is a simple game, you spawn on a 4x4 with a hook, whilst getting attacked by a shark.It appears you are in this endless sea of floating salvage and junk of which you collect and use to build your raft into a home.This game provides countless hours of fun, it is constantly being updated by a very active team, and enjoyed by a very active community. I can see this game becoming a big hit.

๖ۣۜKen†eLL	Not Recommended	38.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kentelljd/	Raft is great to play with friends. This game provides a lot of entertainment. Unfortunately, after a while of building up a raft the game will become unplayable due to extreme lag. The amount of lag is crippling, and is present on multiple systems of varrying hardware components (even high-end systems). This game is not yet optimized to properly handle large rafts. When this issue is fixed, I will certainly recommend picking this game up.
jhnnid	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaureguii/	The game gets really addicting the the first few hours. Although the game is seen as simple, (no tutorials, basic health system, given just a hook at start) It’s fun to go around and figure out the best way to survive, after a million failed attempts and ugly rafts. Pretty chill game to play and talk with a friend, until you go close to starving yourself to death and it gets intense.. The game is also fun to play by yourself too. The devolopers seem to be updated with the community and willing to plan on updating the game often, listening to community feedback. On the other hand, I really think the graphics could be improved. (I play on ultra and it doesn’t really seem like ultra, but it’s not at potato level.) More weapons would be great and more food, maybe another animals on the islands or more visible sea animals/enemies. The only thing you need to survive from is the shark and your thrist/hunger. At the moment, the game is a 7.5/10. Could be higher if added a bit more content and enemies to improve survival system. But it’s still in early access, recommend the game anyway.

Bad Wolf Legacy	Recommended	268.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077043245/	This game is a game that you can play whilst listening to podcasts, which is great, because I like to do things whilst I learn things. There are potatoes and beets (the beets are dumb dont invest in them), there are also other stuff you can hit with an axe. I really like the game cause you can build stuff, stab a shark and somehow melt down seaweed.My only grievance is you can't seem to window the screen so when you have duel screens its a bit tweaky. Also, they need to have some more use for plastic, like... so much damn plastic.Oh there also seems to be a bug with the anchor/sail achivment but thats not a big deal.If you are looking for a chill relaxing game where you just kind of build cause you can this is it, but with sharks! and everything is better with sharks!Also, if you get this and start a potato farm like me, the seagulls are mean jerks, garbage birds ! 
toX!c	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197973359892/	Very nice game...always fun with the shark. ;)Also good content and quick patches and updates. Looking forward to get more content updates.
Lubitz	Recommended	11.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrt2150/	i fell in love with this game right off the bat, maybe the best survival consept that i have played, i really reccomend this.i have had so much fun playting it and it was even better with a friendit also got a great story when you reach the endgame, but i hope the developers put something more to it.i reccomend buying cause you are really going to have a good time
J o h n s o n	Recommended	47.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/el_blanchio/	Okay so i played raft for a while now and there is a few ideas that would improve the  game- NO PIRATES we do not need another sea of theives already a game - make an actual map (with a main hub in mind) - have the ability to trade with friends or load their raft into your world- instead of having random floating rafts make those rafts have traders on them, so you do not end up with 10,000 plastic- Work on some npc that you can interact with - Work on that poor excuss for a story line if they are going to hint at things make it happenThe game just gets repeatitive so they need to change the game alot if they are going to have a player base,.also the game is relaxing and you do not have to focus on the game which is nice the building in the game is great minus the glitching through the floors every once in a while, but the game lacks depth and you end up in creative mode, which is fun don't get me wrong, but the game just isn't enough of a game more like a beta still.All the game is is chop down some trees swim for some scrap, ore, clams, and loot floating abandoned rafts, dealing with a shark that glitches and eats the middle of your raft destroying the work you have done./Please get a good storyline or a main hub, npc's and more furniture and building options.All in all i give this game a 6/10 Fun for about 5-10hrs, just not enough to do to rate this game any higher
HaxTheAssassin	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198201566785/	I like this game. It looks like it has a lot of potential to be amazing. I like how you need to constantly gather material to build up your raft into anything you want.
LePetitLapinouRose	Recommended	26.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LePetitLapinouRose/	Yes, but should be a yes and no. This game is fun, yes, but only for a limited number of hours, after 15 or 20, you just don't have anything left to do than building the largest raft possible. So, if you are a kind of minecraft fan (i am not) that could still be enjoyable, if you are not... another game taking dust on your virtual shelf. Keep in mind that i didn't test the latest large patch but tbh i don't think that large islands and new ennemies can renew the interest, missing a goal or some good  lot of achievement to make an interesting game out of the early access. Difference between a game and a good game is probably a good story, unfortunately Raft doesn't have any so far.
Trash Can Man($)	Recommended	18.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/680366/	This game needs work, but it is alot of fun to play!  The game really keeps you busy and teamwork is essential!

-ChriisKay-	Not Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChriisKay/	In the state its in I can't recommend it at all. I understand its buggy but like theres so much basic♥♥♥♥♥♥that can be fixed. The most annoying are as follows:- Eating and drinking goes down FAR too quickly on normal and hard modes. By the time you eat + drink and them go to do another thing, you need to eat and drink again.- Sharks glitching into the centre of the raft destroying foundation. Understandable if the ones on the edge are destroyed but the sharks glitch into the middle of the raft which seems to be a bug. If not then the animation for the shark biting the raft needs fixed.- Shark bite damage. The shark does literally no damage when you are in the water. It takes off so little damage apart from the first five minutes of spawning its basically no threat at all.Until at least the eating and drinking♥♥♥♥♥♥is fixed the game is unplayable. Other than this the game building etc is quite fun.

Funkopedia	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkopedia/	Instead of going to the survival, the survival comes to you. A refreshing change from the usual, incorporates what are basically contruction legos into the hut building part of these games, AND you never have to leave your camp! Exploration is not yet totally worthwhile - all the islands are basically the same (except for the secret location), and there is no remembering places, and no need to remember them. Far from finished, but so much potential.

Bad Wolf Legacy	Recommended	268.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198077043245/	This game is a game that you can play whilst listening to podcasts, which is great, because I like to do things whilst I learn things. There are potatoes and beets (the beets are dumb dont invest in them), there are also other stuff you can hit with an axe. I really like the game cause you can build stuff, stab a shark and somehow melt down seaweed.My only grievance is you can't seem to window the screen so when you have duel screens its a bit tweaky. Also, they need to have some more use for plastic, like... so much damn plastic.Oh there also seems to be a bug with the anchor/sail achivment but thats not a big deal.If you are looking for a chill relaxing game where you just kind of build cause you can this is it, but with sharks! and everything is better with sharks!Also, if you get this and start a potato farm like me, the seagulls are mean jerks, garbage birds !

LePetitLapinouRose	Recommended	26.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LePetitLapinouRose/	Yes, but should be a yes and no. This game is fun, yes, but only for a limited number of hours, after 15 or 20, you just don't have anything left to do than building the largest raft possible. So, if you are a kind of minecraft fan (i am not) that could still be enjoyable, if you are not... another game taking dust on your virtual shelf. Keep in mind that i didn't test the latest large patch but tbh i don't think that large islands and new ennemies can renew the interest, missing a goal or some good  lot of achievement to make an interesting game out of the early access. Difference between a game and a good game is probably a good story, unfortunately Raft doesn't have any so far.

moist men	Recommended	11.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tstudz/	The beginning of the game is a huge struggle trying to get resources, managing your food and water meters, and dealing with the shark. After about 10 hours of gameplay, you have pretty much found everything in the game. Through those 10 hours though I found the game to be very fun to play with others. I look forward to see how this game develops more over the next year or so to provide more things to do. I reccomend this game to anyone looking for a short, fun survival game to play with others. I do not recommend this game if you are going to play it by yourself.
Lovexender	Recommended	9.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198358352642/	I have played this game for one day, and i think that is is BEAUTIFUL! Let me explain. Raft is an early access game, which many players assume it has bugs. As it does have bugs, they occur very rarely. I encountered one that if you have a bad laptop or computer, it might crash. I play on a mac and run it with Geforce Now. The graphics are beautiful and not much graphical popping. The only complaint about graphics is when it is night time, it is very dark, and you can barely see anything. If you don't have a bed yet, you must suffer through the night. You can play this game singleplayer or multiplayer. You also have creative mode, so if you don't want to gather resources and build, then you can do just that!

:'(	Recommended	11.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BrokenIntoPieces/	I absolutely love this game, for similar reasons why I fell in love with Minecraft about 8 years ago. I grinded out this game in roughly two days with two other friends and while I didn't advance too much with the cosmetics I unlocked all of the tech to find the seemingly end game. I think I could do everything (content wise) this game has to offer in about 25-30 hours of playtime. With that being said, the single player aspect will eventually become stale, even if new things are added. Similar to what Minecraft did super early on, I think the Raft developers should be working towards a multiplayer option within the game, public servers that can be bought and hosted by players, with plugins or modifications to make the game more competitive if the player seeks that. I think this has potential as a wonderful multiplayer game if executed properly. Either way, well worth the buy and had a wonderful 10-ish hours playing the game with friends. I'm currently holding off of the game to come back and start fresh with whatever they impliment down the line. Would recommend to any and all singleplayer-survival game lovers!
Mashiex	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IWMWOW/	Honestly, an extremely fun game to play with friends. It takes you out on a journey on survival, and the entire concept of being trapped on a raft is really cool. There's a few downsides in my opinion so far, but its nothing that wont allow you to have an amazing 10 hours with this game or so. The game would be way better with a story, there's barely any story right now, and whatever there is, its pretty poor. The content there is right now, is pretty limited, it needs more, but im sure with time we will see this. However though, summed up. Buy this is if you want to have a great evening with your friends, its a laugh. However, it gets dull in the long run.
Mortal_Wombat	Recommended	93.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975310237/	Great little aquatic survival game.The only downsides I can see to it so far is that it's short.. I mean, really short. And the constant grind for materials while being harrassed by a god-like shark. You kill it, and it's back in 60 seconds.The most annoying thing is that when you reach a certain amount of foundations, the game starts to chug. And I mean CHUG-A-LUG down to to around 5fps.Don't be discouraged by reviews. I highly recommend this game to anyone.

Roebot01	Recommended	19.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031504568/	I am really enjoying this game so far, I hate sharks so I am actually scared everytime I went in the sea.Two things i think would be a nice feature-An option not to have a shark, just nice to chill - Be able to create a brand new raft, early game wise I was down to 3 blocks and the shark took one in the middle and destroyed my Raft. Would be good if I could have made another 1 block raft and built up again.continuing this. it Would be nice to have mutiple rafts so you can go explore and build, so a map too is needed.End goal and playability wise could helpBut i'm still loving every minute of this game!

Dr_V	Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000408251/	Overall: Raft is a relaxing and casual take on the survival genre. Its a good and fun way to spend a day (but not much more). If you are looking for a serious or challenging survival game - this is not it.Raft is a survival / casual type game. You wake up on a 2x2 raft drifting in an endless ocean. You collect materials that pass you by with a hook and used them to build up your craft and make food / water to survive. You also visit occasional small islands or abandoned rafts to gather additional resources. You are threatened by a shark that follows your raft and attacks you if you step in the water as well regularly attacking the craft itself.Pros:- Scavenging: The collection of materials that pass by as well as collecting from islands has a good balance and feel to it. Its a bit addictive to constantly be adding to your pile, and you feel rewarded when you manage to strip an island of its resources.- Building: The craft construction and expansion is nicely done, and like the scavenging it feels addictive to constantly expand your little raft and slowly turn it into a nice home.- Setting: The look and feel of the game is nicely done and things feel more or less polished. The gameplay is mostly relaxing. The end game reveal has a good tension buildup and left me eager to find out more.Cons:- Enemies: The shark is an uncreative and repetitive monster that generally is uninteresting to deal with. While he may be a challange at the start, the repetitive nature of his attacks (and the fact that another shark replaces a killed shark in short order) makes what should be interesting challange into a tedious management task. It does however add an interesting angle to collecting resources underwater. - Casual: If you are interested in a more complex/challenging survival experience, this is not it. The research system is pretty basic and kind of pointless, the hunger / thirst systems quickly becomes irrelevant and survival is not at all difficult. The content is also pretty limited - the game can be done from start to finish in about 6-8 hours at a slow pace.- Island design: Many islands are hard to access and have steep ledges that require bascially cheesing the physics or building system to get to the top. I honestly don't understand this design decision - its neither challanging or interesting - just fustrating till you understand how to cheese it.- Lack of raft rotation: This might be a big or small issue depending on your personality but for me the lack of an ability to rotate my raft after a collision has left it facing the wrong way is really annoying. It prevents you from making your raft an interesting shape since anything other than a square will eventually end up at an angle.Overall raft is a pretty well done game, despite some questionable game design decisions. Hopefully with more content and tuning of the mechanics it will turn out to be a great game someday.

jeffreypfenn	Recommended	42.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198129254574/	I love this game, some could say I'm hooked. I don't feel it's completely worth $20. But how cares, do to the fact that the game is growing constantly, and with the development team hopefully listening to feedback. It's worth it. Because I said feedback here are my thoughts on how this lovely and sometimes scary game can improve.The life(of pie): It's a vast place full of garbage for some reason, but i'm not complaining. It is however devoid of all life except sharks, fish you can't SEA, and seagulls. It's pretty lonely if you don't consider the shark that always follows you a friend and have no one to play with. So what i'm saying is add more life, like turtles that could be friendly and have a lot of food but are tough to kill. whales that are pretty but dangerous, damaging your raft if you get too close and attracting a tun of sharks upon death(if it dies, maybe you could find a dead one floating). schools of fish where you need to move through them with a net device to get them but they could also attract unwanted friends to show up. The islands are no different except they do have or plant life, but no animal life. So maybe have snakes on some islands to make them have a threat to them, or a cliff face full seagulls nesting ready to protect their eggs ,but not being the most effective at it. There could be cards as well(not much to talk about on the crabs either then they come out at night). now to another topic.The islands: All though pretty and a place of rest, They are all a bit the same. It might be do to the fact the game wants you to stick to your raft, but it's always nice to see something different. Islands more wide and close to sea level, or ones with old ships that ran into them with supplies. I feel they could also be different types of island biomes. instead of just having only the tropical and rocky ones, you could have volcanic ones that are dangerus and unpredictable with there hot water and lava but have raw metals. there could be desert islands with washed up trash every where and small animals too. Now moving on to beneath the ocean blue next to the islands are amazing but elsewhere not so much.The ocean: It's dark black-ish blue and scare but if you are not next to an island it's always that way. maybe have a bottom it filled with life but just out of reach unless you have the right gear for it, and in other areas it be have nothing there to have that feel of there could be something down there and general scariness. having these two would complement each other because knowing whats below you then not knows is a scary jump, but also a reason to go down in the ocean making you actually grasp the feel of the ocean(of course also loot in areas too maybe in those ships I talked about). As well, maybe add big things sometimes big swim under you, or have a gaint squid attact you. You could maybe have a swearm of jellyfish slowly rise from the depths with an erie glow slowly surround your raft making it unhealthy for you to take a dip. This would make the depths a scare place to float into for sure, but I feel that's not enough. Having weather events happen like they do but with more kick, like a storm with lightning striking the raft catching in on fire also rotating the raft as well. Possibly have a tsunami happen, as well.That all I have, I'm done. I know I said a lot but I hope you have listened. This game is wonderful. It's future is bright and has a sea of potentail. I do love this game.P.S. maybe have the shark chill out sometimes or make it so you came scare him off some how. Maybe through the use of befriending dolphins or having longer respown times for it. so it would be easier to do all of that stuff.

Blindstar	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035357147/	I don't really write many reviews, however, this is actually a very fun game and has a lot of promise.  The one shark is more annoying than anything and doesn't really do much, just randomly attacks your raft.  I recommend the game, however, more stuff needs to be added as you learn everything pretty fast.  I feel as though the devs are doing a fantastic job and hope they will develop more for the game, i.e. monster islands, megalodons, or anything their brilliant minds come up with.  It would also be cool to see other people/pirates or other stranded individuals.

Rusty Nutz	Recommended	47.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356965300/	First off, I feel 6 hours is enough even for me to give this review. First and foremost, I'm the type who can get pulled into the simplicity of a game especially when it involves building/crafting. This game offers quite a few good ideas you can work with and when I play, I binge play. Once you get past the first hour and realize you're getting the hang of it and finding ways to keep the shark content just munching on non important parts of your boat, your gold! Anyone who has put nets down to collect the trash finds out quick NOT to put them on the edge of the boat, the shark seems to take to them and rebuilding cost is kinda steep at the beginning. So just a tip, build them 1 block away from the edge or closer to the middle to start until you become the ultimate hoarder. I know once I get close to the 100 hour mark of this game it'll either be time to stop for a while or start all over again which is great because like I said if you you're the type of person who can be creative, you'll love it!Finally, EXPECT TO GRIND NON-STOP! This game even on Easy is constantly requesting to either get your munch on or consuming clean water. Not that any of this is hard, fishing is very easy but until you upgrade your cooking and water abilities you go through a lot of wood it seems like. Just a note for the devs to maybe cut it back like 20% because 1/4 of my time if not more is spent doing just that. All in all the game is great IMO.
Phenomonox	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Phenomonox/	10/10 would stab the bird to death again
Sparrow	Recommended	26.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028181157/	Not a lot of content right now, but worth picking up anyway. There's very little to do so far, but what you can do gives a glimpse at some kind of story planned, and I'll play again when that update comes.As of right now, the only thing to do is build a raft, and there are some problems with that in the current iteration. Once your raft gets big enough you can't hear the shark attacking anymore, the game begins to lag, and the waves will start to crest far above the surface of your raft. So instead of creating a large ship, you're basically creating a nuisance. Looking forward to the future of this game, but for now it's just a couple hours of fun.
fulab	Recommended	53.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016511117/	Ok, there are alot of problems with this game, content is one, crafting is a bit wonkie. Can hit some nasty lag spikes, and i have not tried multi-player. But I like this game...there is alot to hope for in the future with this game, the Dev team seems to be putting in the effort. Yeah it's grindy..but it has potential...and for early access...thats ok.
OneFakeBoi	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/onefakeboi/	For an early access game, this game is impressive. It starts you off on a tiny raft with only a hook to gather supplies. It presents the opportunity for expansion beyond your wildest imagination. Just look at the community pictures at what some people have built. However, I found starting off can be quite difficult (On normal or harder, where your food and water meters deplete quite rapidly). This game is grind heavy and it will take some time to make something you can be proud of.  I recommend this.  The developers are constantly pushing out updates and the community is positive so I think it's worth the investment.

Roebot01	Recommended	19.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031504568/	I am really enjoying this game so far, I hate sharks so I am actually scared everytime I went in the sea.Two things i think would be a nice feature-An option not to have a shark, just nice to chill - Be able to create a brand new raft, early game wise I was down to 3 blocks and the shark took one in the middle and destroyed my Raft. Would be good if I could have made another 1 block raft and built up again.continuing this. it Would be nice to have mutiple rafts so you can go explore and build, so a map too is needed.End goal and playability wise could helpBut i'm still loving every minute of this game!

But theres 2 issues though. 1. when theres items in the nets and i save the world, and when i come back. my items are gone in the nets. 2.  i think theres something wrong with the scarecrow, the scarecrow doesn't do anything. what im trying to say is that when i put my scarecorw beside my crops. the seagull still attacks my crops. and the seagull attacks my scarecrow too.
Justarius	Recommended	60.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007630660/	When you progress in game and make your raft bigger, fps drops really really bad. I was getting 45-50 constant and now 30 if there is no storm. Otherwise it drops 20. Please solve this fps drop. Playing with friends is obviously gonna be the reason to make a big raft or ship. Owerall, great game! Graphics are great. More musics can be added and played according to actions start.
Pesmon_Renn	Recommended	29.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198286316149/	This game is amazing and is continuing to get better, as i havent seen any issues ive seen with other games coming out (pay to play, pay to win, ect.). I have found it incredibly fun to play, and i have a list of some issues ive noticed and things i would like to see added into the game. Also, if there is anoybody taking the time to read all of this, help me out with some questions i mention? It would make things much easier and would be much appriciated.First off, the few but reasonably important issues ive noticed. Once you have progressed in the game and your raft has grown fairly large to accomidate, it rocks far more with the current. Thus, sometimes submerging up to half the raft deep enough you're forced to start swimming. It's even worse when you enter a storm. While this is fairly realistic (to an extent) it is very annoying. Also, i have had someissues that i have not encoutered since before the bow update that i could not use some purifiers or crops without removing them and changing their location, which caused some slight difficulty, since i was in desperate need of the water at the time. I have not encountered the issue again at the time of writing this review, but it may do good to look into the problem farther. Last, but ceratinly not least, what is the use for eggs? The desription of the item says they are used for cooking, but i absolutely cannot find anything on any forum about how to cook them, and i could not find out how while playing.Second, i would like to mention a great thanks for the ability to use a ranged weapon. I no longer have to listen to my little brother who plays with me complain about not being able to hit the seagul with the spear (very annoying). I'm sure it will also help with our shark issues, since our raft is far to large to get there in time with the spear to attack it.Third, I have several requests for future content of the game.1. I know that we're trapped on a raft and resources are limited, but some more food choices would make my day. Maybe a way to collect items such as spices, canned foods, ect. from barrels, stray rafts, oil rigs, and islands. Also, maybe a way to combine food items such as recipes? Possibly giving more to the research table so there is more to do in the game.2. More decorative items, furniture, ect. I have found that one of my favorite parts of the game is to build and decorate rooms, with as many shoes and candles as i can get a hold of. Unfortunatley, the items are getting repetitive and bland. I would love to see more items that i can fish up to decorate. Speaking of fish, maybe do something like the shark head to hang on the walls? A catfish or salmon would look pretty nice next to my three or four shark heads. As for furniture, maybe a bunk bed, lockers (for storage, since i never have enough). I would glady spend time in game to unlock such items and use them. Also, speaking of building, more free buidling mechanics? Not a huge concern, but it more options for how to design the raft would be nice.3. I know there are nets to collect items, but i think it may be reasonable that fish may sometimes appear in them, or there be another item specifically for catching them without the fishing pole? It is very tedious to fish when there are other chores to tend to, such as farming, repairs, navigation, crafting, ect.4. I would love to see some kind of npc companion, such as a tameable parrot and other birds, possibly some other animals? Maybe some small fish to put in fish bowls/tanks? I would spend hours catching clown fish that are near the coral on islands, they would make a nice center piece on a table.5. There seems to be a lack of items in oil rigs, despite the large number of rooms to be explored. Some electronics to give more use for the battery, clothing from lockers, ect. It would make the journey to get there much more worth while. Also, oil? they are oil rigs, as it would seem, and fuel to use for a generator instead of repeatedly crafting batteries? Although, batteries still have their uses early on and as backup if that fuel runs out, or the generator fails? And maybe some kind of motor to use instead of the paddles and sail?6. Shipwrecks would be an interesting thing to be able to find near islands. Obviously being reasonably lootable for scrap metal, rope, and other supplies.7. Being lost in the ocean, I'm sure life gets pretty dull doing the same chorse over and over to stay alive. Maybe some activities, such as checkers, tic tac toe, or simple card games? Those would make passing time a bit more enjoyable.8. Playing with one or two other people is fine, but once you start getting more friends, staring at the same face is odd. More or custom player models would spice things up nicely.Anyway, i've gone on long enough and i by no means expect all of this at once. I thank the devs again for making this game, and i look forward to seeing it grow!
Oh_Shiro	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DARKLORD174/	Runs well is fun to play with friends. But when playing solo i encounter a few problems, one of those problems being i cant get onto islands without burning a large sum of materials to create some ladders or stairs, and even then some islands i cant get on to higher parts of the island because there is no climbing or scaling tool to get onto the higher parts of the islands. Another problem is that the sharks spawn way to frequently after death and there hitbox is way to large. Id kill a shark and not even a minute has passed and another one spawns. On top of high spawn rate i noticed they can chomp you way out of your spear hitbox which is really annoying. Aside from those problems i was really bummed to find out there is no equipment repair bench to repair your expensive tools like scrap hook and scrap fishing rod. I really hope that the devs have plans to add a repair bench as an option so you dont have to spend a large ammount of materials remaking tools, this becomes troublesome when you have a group. In the future i also hope for larger islands that you can explore that might have some water caves with resources in them, think of like a large cave where you drop down into the water and swim through it and find a large cavern with materials. I would love to see more late game large islands after putting down the radio receiver and antennas, for example once the receiver is fully functional large islands start to spawn with radio stations on them. So you can find them on radar, these islands will be like 4x the size of any island ever and are explorable and heavily wooded, on these islands they will contain a new research bench blueprint. Which can be researched at your current research bench and can be crafted to create an advanced research table which has next tier equipment and items. I would definatly like to see something like that in the future. Another idea could be after discovering the new research table you get more advanced building options, like metal foundations. Along side that the larger islands will have far more resources on the islands and under water below them. I have high hopes for the future of this game. If anyone else has some ideas go ahead and comment.

m.furman3270	Recommended	64.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MFurman3270/	Good games
Ossilate	Recommended	40.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198159411192/	Raft is a challenging, super fun sandbox with a start like no other. It's very simple and I hope to see it remain that way as more content (specifically, more island/rock/abandoned raft-like things, such as: coral reef's, ships, wreckage, and destroyed homes or buildings) enters the game. The design and progression of the game is beautiful. It feels like you can "beat" the game pretty quickly, but that doesn't change how amazing the things like diving, exploring, crafting, building, and fighting are. I have reccommended this game to all of my steam friends and every single one of them has enjoyed that has played it, and playing solo is also so much fun and challenging. I have a few ideas that I don't necessarily want to see directly in the game, but perhaps will shape some of the later content. 1.) As I have seen in the picture, a new (or more) different kinds of birds that are hostile or that try and attack certain parts of the raft; crops, players, or foundations, or even the sail.2.) The shark is awesome, but maybe you could even just have a couple more fish or predators in the ocean that you can either "spear-fish" via attacking with the spear. I think the more animals in the game, the more ideas for craftable content will emerge (jellyfish might mean certain healing items or light items, for example). 3.) We know that in the water, there is a shark, and in the sky, there is a bird...but what about the islands? Perhaps, you could add on some islands an animal (predatory or not) that might be an additional source of food income, and maybe have a chance to drop a new kind of item that can be useful (hides for clothing/armor or claws for a weapon, who knows?)4.) Another item that I really think should be in the game is a slingshot - something less powerful than the bow n' arrow. The slingshot could be made from planks, rope, and plastic, and you could make rock ammo from rocks. This would give players a chance to do small amounts of damage to the bird and shark, but not in an overpowered way.5.) It is such a rush seeing a raft or island. I would say later on if you could add more "structures" that you have a chance to discover, such as different biome islands, shipwrecks, or abandoned buildings or homes. They DO NOT have to be big, either. Just something new for players to feast their eyes on.6.) The research table is fantastic - it's a neat way to learn new craftables. I am sure you're working very hard on this, but perhaps creating a second tier research table that is tough to make in order to research higher tier things might be an idea. I would not want to make it confusing for players or anything, but perhaps it would lengthen the time it takes to get to higher tier items. 7.) The feeling of finding the research building at the end of the game is awesome! You give us lore, excitement, and jump puzzles. Players should love this. If you could implement more puzzles and stuff based on a larger variety of the island and raft types that are hard to get to, that would keep players on their toes.8.) All I can think of the are the little metal shacks that you can find on islands or underwater. They are an awesome part of the game. If you have any way to add an additional "crate" to the game (such as, food crates, item crates, chests, caskets, or treasure) that have a rare chance to drop something, that would also enhance exploration. Look, as you can see, I love Raft. I think it has so much potential for so many facets of video games. It is important that you all stick to your course, so to speak. But, just know that this game as a base is super fun. I would love to see more and more content trickling in. I think PvP could also do very well in this, but I understand if that's not a route you wish to take, yet. However, with the creative mode, it seems like it would be both easy and fun for players to have some sort of "file share" whereby they can create custom rafts for other players to use for games such as: hide and seek, capture the flag, spear tag, and many more. Even though there is no PvP yet, you have wisely added the "friendly fire" option whereby players can use to have their own silly or serious PvP modes. If you are playing on staying to Co-op PvE mode for a while, I would certainly made Hard Mode a bit more challenging (shark does more damage, less loot, less island and raft discoveries). Normal is already very well-balanced, but make hard "hard" to the point where players really have to prioritize their objectives. Crouching was a good update, everyone likes to be able to crouch. The bird looks awesome. Please continue to update this glorious game. Thank you so much.- Ossilate / tbanks96

Nekromyr	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kashim14/	Great game... Its relatively small and simple compared to other survival games but unlike some other survival games I enjoyed this very much.the only down side to the game is "content'. though there is enough to keep you quite busy enough to do stuff for a while. If you manage to get enough collectors built and a decent self-sustaining resource, theres not much else. I hope they continue to update the game and add more sea creatures, structures and scuba equipment to build for deeper exploration.
1D4rK	Recommended	53.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198208487289/	For an Early Access game or at it state right now I think it a well develope game.

Of course you can play by your self, but me personally I enjoy to play with other in Raft.

Schefen	Recommended	18.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198110790134/	Casual and nice surival game. Can be tedious grindy to fight hunger and thirst in the beginning but it gets easier as the game progresses. 
SystemDisc	Recommended	16.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SystemDisc/	Fun game! I can't wait to see what the developers add!
KillEM	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/searchem/	Purchased it last month after watching some youtube gameplay videos of this game. I love the amount of things that we can do in this game. Specially the creative section, where we can create a ship or a house or a villa, anything that we can imagine of using unlimited resources. That helps me release some stress at the end of the day. SUGGESTION TO DEVELOPERS:To keep it interesting my suggestion to developers is to keep on adding new stuff in the game and add a map so we know where we are travelling in game. Right now we dont have a clue of our position except the antennae and receiver which gives us a relative location. A Map that gets revealed as we sail.Overall very good experience playing the game.
C R I S P	Recommended	4.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChandlerJM/	Enjoyable when playing with a friend. Some parts are a littel repetitive, however the games remains fun and action-packed in hard mode.
Lord Pigu	Recommended	5.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LordPigu/	Really fun game for the day with your buds. Has a really cool ending. Not really replayable for me. Beat it in a day and was satisfied with the ending.
JakeDrake	Recommended	11.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JakeDrake/	GREAT Game! If you're looking for a survival game that is not expensive then this is it! It is a great Multiplayer and Single player based game. Worth the price.
eXeNewter	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053036725/	It's a sandbox survival with beautiful graphics and steadily developing content. Right now the content is somewhat limited, but hey it's early access. For €20 I still think it is worth it.
kum☹n	Recommended	14.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/seven89/	The game needs more crafting features with designing the raft/boat and larger island explorations. Hunger and thirst is a constant struggle, but it does make the game a bit more challenging. Overall still a fun game to play with friends
Clorax03❖	Recommended	4.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198850328618/	The game is fun and cool at the start, but the shark is annoying. This game is not really hard, just need to know the basics. I got bored when I unlocked everything. If you like building this game is for you.
rainbowbendyplush	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198209158545/	its a great game i give it a 5/5so i would buy it good day 
Door-430	Recommended	99.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016749523/	Pretty fun for a while as you build your raft and try to survive, but once you gotten every thing under control it quickly becomes a bit boring, since you struggle to find something to do.The 365 day achievment was therefore a real pain and I ended up destroying my raft and starting over building a new luxury raft.I would say it's 7/10 the first couple of mounths in game-time, but then drops to 6/10 once you get your survival secured and once you don't feel like building more on your raft.
MasonSTL	Recommended	28.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198074883937/	I would recommend this game to anybody who likes a farely chill game. If you are into more fast paced gameplay this wont really satify your wants. For an early access game I think it is pretty intertaining though it is light on content at this point in time. The small dev team of five seem to be working activly on the game. Looks like there is an update quaterly.I got $20 worth of entainment out of the game. MMV though. If your still on the fence I would check back every three to four months and see where the game is at.
Humming_colors	Recommended	21.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hummingcolors/	To keep this brief, I enjoy this game a lot so far. That being said it's getting a little repetitive. However, I have hopes that since it's early access a lot will be added to span the gameplay out and allow me to explore more.Good:~ Fun to build~ Multiplayer is enjoyable~ Engaging through beginningBad:~ Islands do get repetitive (exploration can be expanded)(Clearly some people don't understand that this game is in fact EARLY ACCESS and can change/add a lot OVER TIME.)

Mr Mek	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198050767444/	After games like subnautica failed to truly to appeal to me for reasons I can only assume is that it was watery Minecraft, this is basically a better, wattery minecraft 2.0. Although it feels like the end of the game is sort of a copout to avoid the obvious detail that the game is fairly new and the developers still have more to add, I can look past it. The gameplay counters any real problems I have with the story. The emptiness fits perfectly, with a shark as your only friend! The aspect of survival from whatever the RNG gods will give you as resources creates the feeling of trying to desperately cling to your vitals. The progression mechanic is forgiving enough that you can feel like it's very possible to thrive, yet challenging enough to create a feeling of pride when you craft a top-tier item. The only main complaints I have aside from the story, is the fact that you have to be going forward to find the stream of resources: I am a huge fan of resources being more random in games. That adds to the feeling of helplessness and makes the resources more pressing to obtain as they flow past. Rather than you thinking "meh I have an infinite amount this direction I'll keep growing my potatoes." Other than that, mid-late game survival is very easy. It's so easy to survive when you evolve your raft enough to be self sustaining 24/7. Those are two complaints that are big enough to note, nothing really too major. It's a great game. I love it. I think it's worth the price it's at. Yes. It's a yes from me.
Paper	Recommended	27.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/riskypaper/	This is a very relaxing game (as long as you don't accidentally fall in the water, or go in the water without shark bait). The only problem with it in Early Access is that it has a very limited soundtrack and the long periods of silence before music starts up again can be a bit jarring. You can always turn the game music off and listen to your own music elsewhere, of course.That being said, it's a fairly simple game that the devs seem devoted to improving. It's a good time waster and you might find yourself coming back or even starting over to see what you can do differently with your raft.
Carrotmander	Recommended	13.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198390516221/	Great game, not much to do after finishing though but hopefully they will add some updates to make it more exciting after finishing the game 8/10
grantgamesgames	Recommended	63.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/grantgamesgames/	Very fun will keep your attention for many hours. The game is early access but there is already a lot to do and keep you moving. The game starts out with a bit of a grind but you'll quickly learn new technologies that make things easier. Playing with friends is a blast.
Versewar	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Versewar/	Love this game, played for 6 hours with my friends before we had crafted everything, the island exploration and team work on killing a shark was probably my favorite. My job was to tend the garden while others crafted the metal refinery or cooking and fishing, The game was super fun and we eventually found the beacon point and looted that the only problem i had with the game was it felt pointless once we had crafted everything and islands felt tedious to climb. I'm excited for the updates to see the new content they bring like more enemies. I'd love it if they made AI Rafts we could raid instead of empty ones or maybe allowed Friends to have a mini map and another raft so we could go in different direction, Since theres not much in the water maybe make it so we could have a Hull below deck So our cots arent always in the way :D
LexC	Recommended	2.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Lex-C/	This is an outstanding game!! Especially in Multiplayer
Despair	Recommended	9.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DespairXXX/	Fun to play with friends, has potential
OnePenguinToRule	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198279408551/	Not a real complicated game you can learn the controls quickly but it doesnt get boring quickly either. While you end up having a vendette with that annoying shark you can kill him. More spawn but it is satisfying. But after you learn everything at the crafting bench and get to the tower the game gets pretty boring as you have no other objective. I understand this is a early access game and i enjoyed it and i am sure that they will expand everything because it is early access. I dont think its worth 20 dollars at the moment, later i have no doubt, but its worth at least 10 becuase it does stick with you for the first 12 hours

Fixation	Recommended	22.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198025856593/	Awesome game! Really fun to play with friends and solo. I´m hoping there will be more late-game content to come, this would surely prolong a single game (5-10h currently, unless you're a true completionist, it might be 15h). If you're into soothing games in a nice ambient environment this game is for you. It's worth the money! Ignore the reviews telling you it's a busy simulator, it's not, if you feel like it is, just play easy, this will reduce the amount of  time you're spending on food/drink. Although I personally think its not very hard (on normal) to get a stable food/drink income going. (Also, get alot of nets asap)

PLEASE FIX THE BUGS, (It's a great game but just too many bugs they need to fix)
Regret	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/regret23/	Reviewing Version 1.03     --------x--------Only got this game today and looking back at the current version changelog, they just added crouching. If that doesn't say that this game has a long way to go, I don't know what else will. My friend and I really enjoy this game and there's a lot of things to do in it's current state. It's a refreshing take on this genre of game. It's not overtly complicated and it's not as simple as a flash game. In it's current state, I would say it's worth about $10-15. Obviously this game will develop overtime and be worth way past the current price of $20. I couldn't recommend this game more. Get it!

9/11 Did Bush (dong)	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SALTEDBACON/	Disclamer: I have only played co-op. I can not say whether this is fun solo.This is a solid game, tons of fun with friends. There does seem to be a lack of content, as I am near completion around ten hours of gameplay. But I did have a friend so it was much faster. I do hope the developers add much more content to make this game last for months to come. I would like to see things like fishnets, fish farms, more electronics. Crop farming seems to be laborious and with minimial payout, so for the most part I ignore my crops. With that said this is a wonderful co-op experience that my friend and have thouroughly enjoyed. More content is needed to make this a lasting game.
Whiskers	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiskersTC/	This game is great with friends. I recommend. However you can beat this game fairly fast and is wayyyy to easy.  
JakkeH	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198146362647/	me and my brother play this 24/7 and we love it
Teemi	Recommended	29.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198144264603/	didnt know there was auto save, so i destroyed my 10 hour work for fun to see the collapse. Then I relogged to see my blood and sweat become a pile of garbo. I shoulda been aborted,  Game good af tho 9.9/10.
AnnieBluee	Recommended	1.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198429916649/	It's an awesome game and very challenging as well,from what i've seen in the game plays.But one thing that bothers me about MY game is that i have at least the minimum of the system requirements and for some reason my game constantly lags even if i tried fixing the issue in many different ways.Hopefully i can find a way to fix it finally..thank you for making this awesome game ^^

Jarold748	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198257513620/	My favorite part about this game would be that you can mine ores in the islands and that its an easier way to find rocks for anchors instead of waiting for a barrel to come and have only 1 or no rocks in it.
deathtoblondie	Recommended	22.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deathtoblondie/	I really have enjoyed this game. It's a relaxing inventory game with a good bit of challenge towards the beginning. Give me building blocks and I will craft and be content! Even after having "finished" the game I still find myself coming back to gather more items and build my raft up more. Before I know it I've spent hours playing! Game play is smooth and graphics are lovely. Overall a highly recommended game! Very much looking forward to additional updates!
dylonx5	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dylonx5/	Pretty fun game as is but still feels empty once you get to the "end game". Would only reccommend when on sale at this point. The world/environment is great and relaxing, until you decide to jump in the water. Pros:-Environment, its nice and relaxing. Almost like Fishing: Barents Sea except your on a raft in the tropical ocean.-ease of building-Grind isn't bad, and actually feels somewhat rewarding.-Abundance of resources in the early game.-The chores are not overwhelming and easy to keep task of.Cons:-Not much direction in the early game (you kind of have to figure out what does what as you go along)-Sharks respawn way too quickly, you only have about a few minutes in between sharks.-Not much replay value, but its still early access, so the devs can totally change this in the future.-World feels empty when playing singleplayer. Just you, a shark, and some seagulls. Maybe you get lucky and see an island or abandoned raft in your travels. -No real "end game". You finish your chores and sail to safety. TL;DR: Good game thats super fun for the first few hours, wait until the devs add more content or for sale.

Buckarama	Recommended	21.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987163544/	This game is actually a lot more fun than it looks - the shark is annoying beyond all comprehension. Food and water on normal the same. Other than that it’s pretty fun. Needs to be a way to get rid of the shark for extended periods of time not just 60 seconds. Maybe even making some shark repellant.
RBLN JESSROCKED	Recommended	69.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jessrocked/	Definitely an addictive game. However the game is very short once  you figured out everything. The rest of the game will be just about completion but no more story which eventually takes away the player's interest.But it surely is a fun adventure. A Must Buy.
JD-Plays	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JD-Plays/	RAFT is a great little game, unfortunately the net code still needs some work and is slightly laggy when going from one side of the world to the other. But the small dev team is adding updates, and im sure they will be optimising in the future.I have finished the game once, and i look forward to playing it again on hardmode!I enjoyed the game overall, and i give it a easy 17/$20 and would HIGHLY recommended you grab it if you see it on sale!

Jacine the Sapphic	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fireheart54/	First off, most relaxing game experience ever.The artstyle is very welcoming and fits wonderfully with the music and scene.Even though the game sounds very base with; you're on a raft, use floating by resources to make your raft bigger and sustainable while dealing with Bob the shark it keeps you occupied for a good 6 hours. Then there's still building your raft even bigger to make it like a floating city of atlantis or you can enter creative mode and see what kinds of things you'd like to build or even better bring in a steam friend as the game supports co-op. This game is unique and very fun. The developers are still adding new things and are interacting with the community which is welcomed. So something id like to see added into the game to add more value to it (even though its already more than worth your money) is to see NPCs added, even simple ones for trade me rope for scrap or they try attack you for resources.
Pirate Ecolie	Recommended	38.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037822798/	Good game to pass a few hours with friends in.
pepermunt9	Recommended	29.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pepermunt9/	Overall a great game to play. There's a sertain rush withing a relaxing vibe, triggering you to stay busy.Looking forward to new content, played it for about 2 weeks now, and already reached the 'end' of the game at this point. even while purely focussing on building on normal mode.for the way the game is offered now, $20 is quite on the high side.
燊老板	Recommended	35.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198271217883/	玩了不到四十个小时，最近的更新也都不错，但感觉内容还是有些单一，个人比较喜欢看风景但除了暴雨天气没什么更吸引人的天气环境了，个人感觉加点闪电和雷会更好
The Cloud	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045088147/	Awesome game! Thoe its to easy so survive. Food keeps stacking up so eventualy dont need to "farm" anything. Will play it again but after reaching endgame in hard solo playing i want something more challengeing in the game. Id like to see some different movement for the shark, its way to easy to outsmart it. And the fact that u turn the back on the shark 1 sec and he bites u even thoe he was not even close before. Kind of enoying, and predicteble AI shark. Would like to see some other threts to the existens of the raft. maybe weather, seasons that can ♥♥♥♥ u over. hurricanes, snowstorms? who says global weather cant be a little unnatural?Loved the game so far and awesome survivalgame. 10/10 so far.

geoffvwebb	Recommended	10.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198023766358/	It's an enjoyable crafting game. If I had one gripe it's that the shark is a bit *too* present.  It's hard to do much of anything as you're constantly having to fend it off or lose bits of your boat.  But otherwise fun, especially for a game this early on.
Danderson	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/danderson1996/	This game is a perfect storm of positive aspects, with only minor gripes. The last time I have taken so quickly and consistently to a game was Portal 2 (though I only started that one in 2016). As such, I want to make a detailed review for prospective buyers who are rightly wary of the price tag (Currently $20)TL;DR: This game is a fresh spin on the survival genre that, despite its flaws, delivers a unique and pleasant experience for single and multiplayer. Also, the devs are active so improvement and expansion on these ideas is to be expected.This game has a lot of things going for it that are becoming increasingly uncommon in the genre and in gaming:Originality: Raft is only a cousin of Minecraft. It involves food, survival, and exploration but dispenses these aspects to the player in entirely new ways. The problem I have had with many games in this genre is that they are not different enough from the ones I had played (namely Minecraft and Terraria) to make them memorable or compelling. For fans of the genre, this is truly distinct.Difficulty: Many games propel the progression of the player/story with increasingly difficult challenges that often start out very hard. Don't Starve is a good example of this. The result is that the learning curve is so steep as to drive off new or casual players. This game gives the player the ability to scale the difficulty through the risks they are comfortable with. Players are not punished for being safe, but risks are rewarded. The shark can be manipulated and killed, and a player can get very far without ever being open to attack. The only interaction that the player cannot avoid is the shark's attacks on the raft itself, which are easily dealt with and not so common as to be more than a nuissance.Multiplayer: This game all but forces the players into being cooperative. Obviously, a troll can destroy or steal, but the very nature of the game requires that players stay close and work together on certain tasks. Additionally, there is ever only 1 shark, so strength in numbers quickly becomes an advantage. This aspect is actually what prompted me to start playing in the first place.Obviously, there are some flaws, but they are minimal compared to the game's strengths. Nevertheless, the game does have these issues:Technology: I was taken aback when I reached the end of the research tree. The only object to have more than 2 'tiers' is the planter, which only allows the player to grow larger flora. There is no increase in efficiency. In every other case, (As of now) there is either 1 upgrade or none at all. Also, many of the tool upgrades do not feel better enough to justify the expensive resources needed to craft them. There is very little vertical progression in the game, but the devs are active so more content is very likely.Content: As of right now, there are only 3 things that the player can ome across to explore in the ocean, and one of them is your reward for reaching the end of the tech tree. Of the other two, one of them is a small raft that functions mainly as a treasure chest of advanced materials, and the other is the island-reef that has special resources needed for the little advancement there is. These points of interest have very little variety, both in appearance and in resources. Again, the game is actively being updated so this is likely to change.Mechanics: These are very minor issues that feel more like bugs than design choices. When trying to harvest reef resources that are very close to the surface, the waves can pull the player away by lowering enough to put him on the 'surface' and then swelling higher. Occasionally, the stream of resources surrounding the raft will inexplicably stop spawning, sometimes for many minutes, which is very frustrating in the early and middle games.I recommend this game in general, but with the stipulation that it is definitely not for everyone. It doesn't try to be a combat survival RPG, and it is not going to offer the player much to look at other than a wide, blue ocean. For fans of the survival genre, and for casual gamers who enjoy couch multiplayer, this game is well worth the price. Otherwise, wait for it to go on sale, or wait until more content is released. That said, I really enjoyed this game because it is different and well-executed, and I will be eagerly awaiting new updates. 
chad.lagrange	Recommended	64.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198845814375/	it is fun but there are some glitch that need to be fix like if you shut the door when your in it you will be stuck or get  thrown. but it is a good and fun game 
Junho	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042446583/	I bought this game because a friend recommended it, saying it has tons of potential. He was not kidding.The atmosphere reminds me of my first moments in Minecraft, which I started playing in its Alpha stage. Raft has a very similar calming feel to it, even though there are some scary aspects in the beginning, such as the lonely start on a small raft with no one around except the bloodthirsty shark, or the first dive in to the dark depths in search of materials.Even though the price is high for a game that is still in development, it does not have any noticeable bugs and it truly offers a fun experience for at least six hours, that is, if you only pursue the "end game", (which was a very surprising twist!). With friends, Raft can offer so much more, especially in the future when it is updated further.TL;DR: has a cozy, minecrafty feel to it, hardly any bugs so far, offers great fun for at least 6 hours. Would recommend.
blackplatypus | leek	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/platypooz/	10/10 would panic over drowning in a game again
PhiloDragon	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PhiloDragon/	Its a pretty solid game but I found it tedious and boring when you're alone since you often have to grind for a very specific resource (mostly wood.) On the other hand when you have friends the game becomes so much easier since you can divide the work load and double the amount of resources you're collecting. If you plan on playing this I'd say make sure you have a friend handy to start a world with, when you're alone its not really worth the experience.
llamont17	Recommended	25.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/randious/	this game is fine, but it loves to kick you while you down, every single time i get copper i swim back to my raft then i die
Assmanmold	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/spetsnaz2666/	Very fun game. Lots of things you can do by yourself for sure, but with friends you run out of content quickly. Can't wait for updates.

Just the Tip	Recommended	36.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198226374508/	at first i thought i was having a glitch in this game when everything disappeared but turns out that happens if you're raft has left you for a while.  i had played stranded and that game was all glitchy with the islands disappearing so i thought this was the same thing over... its not.
IcyBlaze	Recommended	7.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IcyBlazeRB/	Its a good game.Some issues for example if your raft gets to big you'll lag. I have a gaming pc that can run Grand Theft Auto 5 on highest graphics and it lags when my raft gets too big on this game -_-Also I would love to see more things too do can get boring at times.
Billie Dread	Recommended	31.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Guitarriff/	This game is wonderful. It's exciting. It's chill. It's mysterious and you can co-op! I always find a sunny sky or moonlit night that I want to take screenshots of. The learning curve to start might be a little frustrating but once you get the fundamentals? You're swimming! But don't actually swim - cause shark!
Adam Ide	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011510136/	Fun but needs more content, I'm already pretty bored with it.
jaycoug	Recommended	30.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Majestic_C_FlapFlap/	Well,   10 minutes into the game my raft got stuck up against the first Island it floated to,   couldn't move it,   couldn't get anymore supplies and died for lack  of food and water.    hmmmmm.   Should have some sort of mechanic to be able to bump the raft or drag it or something early on or make it bump the island and move away from it or something.  So far,   love the grappling,  the spear is nice and everything else seems to run smoothly.   Will obviously keep playing and hope it goes better on the next round.
CastoR	Recommended	51.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198811500086/	if you have an extra $20 its a good game. i loved this game even before i bought it. still love it now, but it could still use alot of work. the game can be run through in just a few hours on the hardest diffuculty. so its not a long game. hope they keep adding more it has so much potential to be a an even better game. if you have a decent gpu just run it on the best settings, i wouldnt change them around mid game either. it cuases some pretty bad bugs. let me just say if i had control over this it would be some ark level♥♥♥♥♥♥
...	Recommended	130.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198839016878/	Very enjoyable when playing with friends.Pros :Good building mechanicsNice sounds ( May Get Repetitive )Good multiplayer serversEasy concept and controlsEasy to understand Negative :Thirst and Hunger needs working on as it is a pain to keep them up when they are always low.Not enough areas and content to keep going for alot of time as you can find and do everything very early on, In my opinion more islands and larger land areas might help to bring another sort of resource gathering and more building options.

Godofsalt76	Recommended	21.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198843396957/	This an amazing game i love it
The Law	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OGSur/	Good with friends, Although lacking tons of content. Would advise waiting till full game release if you have no friends otherwise it will get boring. Really only thing you can do now "end game" wise is build your boat out more and automize everything. 
Hades	Recommended	38.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970555569/	A good Game, But my only complaint is the game gets repetitive after you build the antanas and signal box and find the  (????)    So I'm hoping because this is early Access that the Devs create several more stories for the game to follow.  Maybe a few expansions.  Maybe even allow Modding so people can create stories and other content.   Even though there is a lot you can do. so yea I recommend this game.
r1	Recommended	11.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/damn254/	The game is fun, but right now there aren't many things to do in the game.You start out at your little raft and have to farm materials that float in the water and expand your raft, as well as craft more items to help you survive, etc. That's pretty much the gameplay right now, except that later on you have to go underwater near the islands for some materials, doesn't really change too much and I at least did not feel like advancing / progressing much while playing a lot.
veselokasai	Recommended	26.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blazecraft8763/	you people dont get it. it's not about wether its worth $20 now, it's about what the finished product is worth. if you think it could be worth $20 when it's finished, then you have to pay that now... duh... if you own the early reliese then you own the whole game. i personally enjoy this game very much and i think that it can only get beter over time. i recomend that you get the game( note that this game is ment to be played with friends )
♛ King Aebr ♛	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044985335/	I don't even remember why I bought this game, but I'm glad I did. It has to be the most ridiculous concept for a survival game in a while. It's uniqueness is what brings it to the top of the horror survival games. Forget slender, forget the forest. If you really want to pucker your bottom lips, jump into the water and try and swim away from the shark. Nearly pee pee poop my pants every time. 11/10
Later	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198301357863/	I recommend this fame to people who barely play survival games since it doesn't take long to reach the end (at least rn) played for about 8 hrs but after your done theres not much to do.. this game isn't done yet so im expecting more and if there is ill be seeing you guys being eaten alive...
Chris1220873	Recommended	47.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198094643547/	This game is fantastic. I love it. recomended it to all my friends. :) i just hope they keep adding stuff. this game could be the next big thing. please keep up the good work!!! cant wait for updates! havent had this much fun on a game in a long time
TacentH	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TCH13/	Raft is a simple survival game where you gather recourses to expand your boat, in-turn increasing your chances of survivability against all that opposes you on the great oceans as you drift aimlessly off away from everything. It is so simple and easy to understand and pick up, but so so addictive and fun. You start off with a small 2x2 platform and expand from it, hooking in the recourses you need and your adventure begins. From the description above you may think this is a boring game, however there is alot to contend with when you add in hunger and water bars, limited amounts of oxygen, sharks (which will kill you) and seagulls (which steal your food) the game becomes alot more of an exciting experience. On top of this scavenging there is also the vast technology and crafting trees which can be opened up by crafting a research table, this in turn opens up things like scuba gear which allows for longer time under water and things like bows and stronger spears to help with the shark attacks.There is also a multiplayer option for those of you who have friends which does really add to the fun of the game and i's really well excecuted. I have encountered no issues with multiplayer (no lag etc.) and think it's a really great addition to the game that helps to extend the playability of this game. I really think this is an excelent game that has no faults. The crafting is brilliant, the little gimmicks are brilliant (such as calendar counting your days survived) and i just really enjoy passing my time trying to survive with friends in this beautifully crafted game.Finally, I would like to say thank you to the developers for this game because not only have they made this a reasonable price, but they listen to the community. They have a discord where you can talk to devs and they listen to your suggestions with basically weekly polls where they take feedback from the public in which way to take the game.There is really no where you can go wrong in the purchase of this game.

Bandulu	Recommended	20.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960938302/	Great fun game thats so relaxing to play. But beware ....you will start playing this at 6pm ..next thing you know its 4:30 am !!Seriously though ...a great game
Lostinsurf	Recommended	22.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198152281479/	Love this game! Very relaxing. No bugs that I've run into. It's a nice break from playing competative multiplayer games all the time.
zieboid	Recommended	25.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zieboid/	This game is so fun to play with friends. It is actually a challenging game at times and I think the suspense is what makes it so fun.
Wand of Inferno	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wand_of_Inferno/	The beginning is slow but comfy, the music soothes the game experience and it's beautiful.Once you are mid-game you should have enough food and water to survive.Near the end you got everything to get a collection of shark heads and enough chests to need another raft to fit them in.And color me impressed, I didn't know this game had actual lore, which is something I liked the most from this game.I played alone, but maybe with a friend or two you can make this a blast, such as The Forest.And this is early access... who knows what else they will add?
netgyrl	Recommended	27.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/netgryl/	TL/DR: Over all a fun open world survial game that is good for some obsessive fun for about 25+ hours.  Pros -Looks great!Is mostly a relaxing experienceFairly balanced build/research cycleCool decorative stuff to build and bling out your raftResonable resource storage and craftingCons-Lacks end game goals and reasons to keep playing once you have built everything and have a stable survival, collection system running.  Once you have seen one Island, you have seen them all.  Shark is annoying as there no easy way to to distract him for more then 1 min 15 sec at a time.  Diving should be devoloped more - that is where they could really expand the exploration need/drive.  Make oxygen tank upgrades and long lasting shark repellant and add a ton more underwater content ie caves, sunking ships, more ocean life, under water harpoon/fishing etc.    I will keep playing as more content is added.  Thanks for fun Redbeet!  Keep up the great work.
sinper no sniping	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198422275267/	The game made me relaxed but the shark, oh boy when he bites your raft you better have a stick to poke him with.

remixazkA <3	Not Recommended	2,259.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/remixazkA/	This game is probably one of the best games i have, and ive more than 300... Its a simulator of the economic, the politics and the wars during the 2ºWW.The game is reallly good and not so hard to understand, despite learn to play it takes a couple of hours and u will still miss some mechanic.Now, the bad thing. Start a online game take minimun 2 hours to be a good game whit vetted majors etc..BUT u need to know that the comunity is full of no-live unpolite trolls and bad losers, this ppl dont have honour and his words worth♥♥♥♥♥♥ so if u enjoy multiplayers, competitive and balanced games whit normal ppl who play whit is better that u didnt buy this game, doesnt worth it.
♨TEA.UP®♨ L.U.P.I.N	Not Recommended	162.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054902584/	PROS:- history.- easy to understand the game.CONS:- everything will become messy with tons of unit tags and battle plans. It is really frustrating for someone who is new to the series like me.- nuke doesn't make any big different. you nuke a country servertal times and it still fights. - lack of information on battle plan, I think it is over simplified.- infractructure takes too much time to build, there is no way to make it cope with the growing size of your army. There must be an option to supply with air drop.- ugly interface.- shallow game compared to the price tag. Small countries are nothing in the game, their stuff are generic even the generals' portraits.
Charles	Not Recommended	839.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlesLutzeJCKFL/	It's good but... we all know what happened with CK2 - the DLC's are coming.
SpermCube	Not Recommended	480.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030364020/	The game is extremely easy. The AI never puts up much of a defense. The AI makes the weirdest units and is always out of supplies and manpower. The AI just tries to max out its equipment stats, even when certain upgrades come at a negative cost. The AI doesn’t try to spare its men, it just throws everything at you in a laughable attempt to defeat you. Every time I reach 1942/43 I realize that I pretty much won already. Of course, you could go through the extra effort to occupy some countries, but you know you will win, so why bother?I can't release countries that existed historically during world war 2 and the provinces don’t match with (planned) historical partitions very well.They cut out the tactical stuff, that's probably too hard for their new fanbase, so now you just draw lines on a map, hit execute and see your units march down the braindead AI's land. The production thing is pretty cool, it's one of the few things the game got right, but only several nations get to produce unique equipment (not that it matters very much), so all non-major nations don't have much feeling to them.You can install a ton of cool mods, but because the base game is boring, people stop updating their mods and you'll at some point notice the limitations of the base game and get bored as well.Maybe multiplayer is ok, just read another review if you want to find out. I've never played multiplayer and in the past, it was never necessary because single player sufficed.This game is a joke. During its development users on the paradox forums kept trying to help the devs, but the devs just talked down to their customers and kept on developing this disaster of a game. The devs kept saying they weren't making the game easier, but rather they were just "streamlining" it. The devs would have done better taking one of their previous (still broken) HOI games, fix it, add new stuff and release it as a DLC.
Boromir	Not Recommended	370.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/boganisvej/	I enjoy this game alot! However, I think that, like EU4, much of the DLC-content should be considered as 'must-have-content' in the base game. For exampl, the images, textures and content of lesser nations are being sold as add-on content. For a game prized at +40 Euro (for both the base game and the DLCs) I think that this game is obvisously spilting its basegame-content to be sold as DLC-content, in relation to the prize in contrast to content. Again, i enjoy this game immensely, but I hate it when Paradox does this to their fan base.

Hans G. Schultz	Recommended	942.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/HansGeorgSchultz/	Hearts of Iron IV is a very beautiful and polished game that not only welcomes back returning players of the franchise, but is very friendly to new players. My favorite part about this game is that fact that you can literally do anything with your country. One example that I have is the German and Soviet forces fighting together against the Western Allies. There are too many scenarios to count for this game which not only makes replaying the game a new adventure every time, but also adds plenty of fun with new strategies that you may experiment with. Overall, I'd give this game five stars. Brilliant job!

You can get a 100:1 K:D against some countries [ https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/171538555561675257/A5CBC00548DFCA689C9D83014378E29AAE750CEE/ ] on veteran difficulty with little effort because they don't defend themselves properly and pick the worst doctrines, high command, division templates and economic laws.- There are still no diplomatic options which makes having factions or playing with other players a pain.- Bugs such as countries randomly joining your faction when there's nothing you can do about it (because there's no diplomatic option to kick them out).- Air combat is still ♥♥♥♥ed since you have to assign aircraft to a region hundreds of miles wide even if the combat is only in a tiny part of it. Naval combat is almost as bad, with there essentially being no depth to it (if you'll pardon the pun).- Doctrines are still imbalanced with Mass Mobilisation getting no use because *less training time doesn't matter at all*.- Multiplayer games still desync and crash all the time after a few years in-game.- Britain's nation focus tree is pointless for the most part compared to every other major nation and isn't even historically realistic (see: Mobilised Army).- Armour and paratroopers are mostly pointless since the best strategy for pretty much any nation is to just spam infantry/artillery divisions with some mobilised thrown in.- Can we just get a Chinese focus tree for ♥♥♥♥ sake.I still love the game itself and there are mods that fix some of these problems to various degrees but Jesus Christ they've had a year to fix the game and they spent that time making focus trees for Yugoslavia and other irrelevant nations and charging us £8-15 for features that should have been in the game to begin with, so ♥♥♥♥ em. I mean after all we have modders that are making way better focus trees on the workshop and for countries that people actually want to play, so why waste time with that instead of fixing the core mechanics. /rant

Gabbo	Recommended	457.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gabbok/	If you are like me and like WW2, Stategy or RTS games then I highly suggest purchasing Hearts of Iron IV. The game can be a bit overwhelming at first, but after a couple hours of playing I could grasp the basics of the game. There are many things you can do in Hearts of Iron. That could be taking over all of Europe as communist France, or teaming up with some friends in multiplayer to conquer all of the world. It is really up to you. There are also plenty of mods on the steam workshop you can download, and whilst most of them are complete garbage, there are quite a few great mods like Kaiserreich or The Great War mod. Unfortunately, at the time of writing this review the game has two main DLCs with 1 more on the way. The DLC is not too expensive, but if you don't want to cough up the money you will have to settle with mods. Hopefully this review makes you consider purchasing Hearts of Iron IV, it has become one of my favourite games on steam.

yonder	Recommended	263.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yonderTheGreat/	Nearly 300 hours in, and this game is still great.  Far from perfect.  It's got some of standard Paradox DS issues, such as AI issues, but they really only stand out because the majority of the game is so good.. and most of those bugs are simply ones that you have to accept because you're playing a videogame (AI isn't as good as a human, for example).The DLC-hating reviews on here are the main reason I chose to post this review.  Hate the DLC and/or the prices?  Well... you may very well be an idiot, but if you have a well-reasoned basis for your opinion, then that's fine.  But holy cow, go to the DLC page.  Don't give a negative review to the BASE GAME because you hate the fact that they continue to support the game w/ DLC years after its released (CK2, for example, is going on seven years).  I'm sorry that you hate the fact that game developers want to get paid, but there's a REASON most devs don't continue to support their games year-in-and-year-out... because of diminishing revenue.PDS supports their games w/ free patches and they release EXTRA content for those of us who want it and who want to pay slightly higher prices in order to continue to support the company.  Those who want the DLC but want to pay lower prices simply need wait a few months, their DLC is ALWAYS on sale... usually at the time of release of new DLC.The game is great enough to warrant a review anyway, but the idiots giving negative marks to a game they admit they like just infuriate me to no end, so they inspired me to post this.Anywayz... the depth is amazing.  It's technically turned-based (each turn is 1 hour) but it basically plays as a pausable realtime grand-strategy wargame.  You can appoint ministers (up to 18 I believe) to assist with things and you can design your divisions down to the batallion level.  That's what I mean by amazing depth.  It's also got plenty of flavor events, such as Earhart and the '36 Olympics.  And, of course, the game is incredibly mod-friendly.  If you find shortcomings in the base game and/or the DLC, then head to the workshop.  There's PLENTY of amazing stuff there.*IF* you find the videos and reviews interesting, you'll most likely absolutely love the game.  If you read the reviews and watch the videos and think "people are entertained by this?  YAWN!!!!!" then you'll probably hate this game.If you're reading this you're probably at least moderately curious... so you'd likely really enjoy it!
Justb_	Recommended	139.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/justb_/	WW2 at it's finest, Paradox has done it again with another solid release and a solid game. HOI IV does have a learning curve  but not as big as HOI III. After you get the hang of the game, you will have the best expericence there is for WW2 strategy games. This is a solid game and is worth every penny, and Paradox will not let you down with plenty of updates and fixes along the way. 10/10 and I still barely know how to run my empire :P It is just that good.

Savage	Recommended	47.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975359487/	Hearts of Iron 4... I was spewing venom at it. Being a big fan of HoI3, I was not happy about the seemingly dumb'ed down mechanics of the game. Specifically, the supply system. I loved the fuel simulation of HoI3, and really that's the only area that was changed that many had a problem with. Everything else was an improvement, and even some haters of HoI4 can't argue that the planning system is a vast improvement over the manual movement of before.So when I got my hands on HoI4, despite my concerns, I was pleasantly surprised. I still miss the fuel simulation, but now its done in a way that I can understand. And lets face it... No on, no one understood how the supply mechanics in HoI3 really worked, even the devs admitted before that they had no clue cause a lot of it was abstracted simulation that had a lot of problems with it. On the surface, it worked. For the most part. Under the hood, it was a mess.HoI4 cleans up a lot of areas that 3 didn't do well. Sure, some players got a kick out of manually managing and directing each and every single unit. Not everyone is obsessive compulsive like that, not everyone can pump 300 hours into a game. HoI4 gives you access to both worlds. Want to be an obsessive compulsive armchair general? Go right ahead, it takes nothing away from the experience. Want to sit back and let the semi-competent AI do its thing for you? Go right ahead. And when the AI screws up, you can jump in and fix it.So whats the problem? I've read some negative reviews that complain about the whole planning system and how they 'miss' the old way of doing it in HoI3. Ehem... Sorry to inform you, but you can still tediously manage your units as before.  So negative nancies, get over yourself!This game isn't perfect. The AI is still pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in some areas. But AI development is an ongoing process and hopefully in time, things will improve. HoI4 has improved though in every other way and takes the tedious process of waging war out of the equation. I actually feel like a general playing this game. My one major gripe with 3 was that I literally had too much control, and waging war became a process that I didn't look forward to. Now I can.One thing to add: Paradox's hideously overpriced DLC TFV that just came out should be avoided until it can be gained at a hefty discount. I'm usually supportive of Paradox and their DLC method, but there is no way in hell, for the amount of content you get, should TFV be seriously  considered as a purchase at the price they are charging. Is this a sign of things to come?...

A lot of people seem to give up after about 70 hours because it's not fun for them anymore, that is the dumbest thing you can do. When the singleplayer base game and mods aren't fun anymore you should absolutely find a nice group of people to play multiplayer with. With about 20 people all the frustrations that usually come with the ai dissapear completely.

If you read the reviews and watch the videos and think "people are entertained by this?  YAWN!!!!!" then you'll probably hate this game.If you're reading this you're probably at least moderately curious... so you'd likely really enjoy it!

Savage	Recommended	47.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197975359487/	Hearts of Iron 4... I was spewing venom at it. Being a big fan of HoI3, I was not happy about the seemingly dumb'ed down mechanics of the game. Specifically, the supply system. I loved the fuel simulation of HoI3, and really that's the only area that was changed that many had a problem with. Everything else was an improvement, and even some haters of HoI4 can't argue that the planning system is a vast improvement over the manual movement of before.So when I got my hands on HoI4, despite my concerns, I was pleasantly surprised. I still miss the fuel simulation, but now its done in a way that I can understand. And lets face it... No on, no one understood how the supply mechanics in HoI3 really worked, even the devs admitted before that they had no clue cause a lot of it was abstracted simulation that had a lot of problems with it. On the surface, it worked. For the most part. Under the hood, it was a mess.HoI4 cleans up a lot of areas that 3 didn't do well. Sure, some players got a kick out of manually managing and directing each and every single unit. Not everyone is obsessive compulsive like that, not everyone can pump 300 hours into a game. HoI4 gives you access to both worlds. Want to be an obsessive compulsive armchair general? Go right ahead, it takes nothing away from the experience. Want to sit back and let the semi-competent AI do its thing for you? Go right ahead. And when the AI screws up, you can jump in and fix it.So whats the problem? I've read some negative reviews that complain about the whole planning system and how they 'miss' the old way of doing it in HoI3. Ehem... Sorry to inform you, but you can still tediously manage your units as before.  So negative nancies, get over yourself!This game isn't perfect. The AI is still pants-on-head ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in some areas. But AI development is an ongoing process and hopefully in time, things will improve. HoI4 has improved though in every other way and takes the tedious process of waging war out of the equation. I actually feel like a general playing this game. My one major gripe with 3 was that I literally had too much control, and waging war became a process that I didn't look forward to. Now I can.One thing to add: Paradox's hideously overpriced DLC TFV that just came out should be avoided until it can be gained at a hefty discount. I'm usually supportive of Paradox and their DLC method, but there is no way in hell, for the amount of content you get, should TFV be seriously  considered as a purchase at the price they are charging. Is this a sign of things to come?...

stheve	Not Recommended	138.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102664309/	This game is not worth playing without heavy modding, the gameplay is exceptionally boring youll spend 45 minutes sitting at your computer waiting for another year to tick by, overall the game is not an improvement over HOI3 which came out in '08
Raymuuze	Not Recommended	32.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/raymuuze/	Instead of finishing their empty shell of a game with DLC they should've finished developing the game before releasing it. At release it was quite bare bones and while some patches helped, a lot of content such as flavor for interesting nations is locked behind DLC. If this ends up being handeld just as Europa Universalis 4 you might as well dodge this bullet.
Paul von Hindenburg	Recommended	647.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081436358/	This game is amazing, it is fun, indepth and has an amazing and active community. Paradox continues to make free updates as well as DLC and supports the game as its player base grows.

Nekrozusthra	Recommended	372.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Visigorkz/	Such a great game. I took many hours playing this game, and you have a lot of options inside (Not infinite, because it's impossible); many possibilities, many ways, and of course is not a simple game. If you like challenges, this is the best game you can buy. Another plus point is it's easy programming language, which allows you to create mods so easily. Of course, watch tutorials, but even if you are not into programming world, you are able to create really good and funny mods (Like create new countries, leaders, political ideologies...)I give this game a 10/10
dog!♥💤	Recommended	1,051.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/extraordinarilycanine/	It's a game I've found myself coming back to quite often. I've sunken over six-hundred hours into this and there's always something new I want to try; this is especially true with the modding community. There are so many fantastic overhaul mods for this ranging from a modification set in the modern geopolitical landscape of today, to a world in which Germany and the Central Powers emerged victorious in The Great War only to find themselves preparing for another war.It has its flaws, from serious optimization issues to some questionable artificial intelligence, but after a while and several updates I have no doubt it'll be a game that almost everyone will find some sort of joy in.

Falcone Kieck	Recommended	679.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198388191907/	This game is really fun and I strongly reccomend this game. If you get bored of the WW2 setting or layout, like I was, there are a bunch of mods that change the layout and the gameplay of the game. My personal favorite being the Great War mod that is based on WW1, and also the millennium dawn mod which is a modern day mod. Although the game doesn't have that much of an active multiplayer following from my experiences with the game. Sometimes you might be able to get into a multiplayer game but from my experiences most of the multiplayer games are either locked so they can play with thier friends only, Very strict meaning that the host of the lobby will kick you if you don't play as the country that they want you to play (So.... Toxic), or the host will have mods that effect the game in very small ways but the game requires you to have those mods so you can't join the game until you download those mods. Like I said sometimes you might be able to find a game every once in a while but the game that your in will most likely contain the max of 5 people if your lucky, but those are just my experiences. But if you have a friend that already has the game then your good because I have found no glitches with multiplayer or single player in my 42 hours of playing the game. So to wrap up what I said I think that you should get the game if your into startegy games, but if your looking to get the game only for multiplayer than i highly suggest that you find a friend that has the money and interest to buy the game so you can play multiplayer. YOU HAVE BEEN WARN
big man Rædwald	Not Recommended	697.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/clarky214247/	As of 23/06/17 I'm changing this to a negative review in wake of the release of Death or Dishonour: - AI is still downright ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You can get a 100:1 K:D against some countries [ https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/171538555561675257/A5CBC00548DFCA689C9D83014378E29AAE750CEE/ ] on veteran difficulty with little effort because they don't defend themselves properly and pick the worst doctrines, high command, division templates and economic laws.- There are still no diplomatic options which makes having factions or playing with other players a pain.- Bugs such as countries randomly joining your faction when there's nothing you can do about it (because there's no diplomatic option to kick them out).- Air combat is still ♥♥♥♥ed since you have to assign aircraft to a region hundreds of miles wide even if the combat is only in a tiny part of it. Naval combat is almost as bad, with there essentially being no depth to it (if you'll pardon the pun).- Doctrines are still imbalanced with Mass Mobilisation getting no use because *less training time doesn't matter at all*.- Multiplayer games still desync and crash all the time after a few years in-game.- Britain's nation focus tree is pointless for the most part compared to every other major nation and isn't even historically realistic (see: Mobilised Army).- Armour and paratroopers are mostly pointless since the best strategy for pretty much any nation is to just spam infantry/artillery divisions with some mobilised thrown in.- Can we just get a Chinese focus tree for ♥♥♥♥ sake.I still love the game itself and there are mods that fix some of these problems to various degrees but Jesus Christ they've had a year to fix the game and they spent that time making focus trees for Yugoslavia and other irrelevant nations and charging us £8-15 for features that should have been in the game to begin with, so ♥♥♥♥ em. I mean after all we have modders that are making way better focus trees on the workshop and for countries that people actually want to play, so why waste time with that instead of fixing the core mechanics. /rant

Otherwise, it may eat your computer for breakfast. Speed 5 is a nightmare for slow PCs.What can I say? You probably know about this already, so try it out.P.S. Paradox is notorious for it's DLC, and this coupled with mods allows huge degrees of freedom for gameplay. WW1 anyone?
tumppis	Not Recommended	282.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008775297/	AI is awful and will destroy it's navy with idiotic strategies and kill hundreds of thousands of men in stupid landings.New frontline system is not working with all armies extending them all the time and sending divisions from the other end to other.Exiled divisons will repatriate to a ally trough a neutral country and die due to lack of supplies even when your controlled province would have been closer.Paradox policy of fleesing customers with DLC-s is strong in this one as one would expect.

Katsumoto	Recommended	1,912.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065102685/	Overall fun game if you would like to explore and master the WW2 art of war or make some ♥♥♥♥ed up alternative history. The former has quite a nice amount of complexity with regard of choices (eg. whether to make more tanks or more planes and how these divisions should be structured and distributing production to different equipment), whilst the latter was personally for me fun at first but got boring eventually. However i have to say the game is worth the money just for the opportunity to oppose germany as poland or be france/uk and not betray the czechs or make neo-ottoman empire even if it gets boring eventually.I wouldn't say that the DLCs offer enough for their cost as those focus trees are nothing spectacular and there are some  nice trees in many mods that are free. the more useful features are releasing countries as puppets which imo should be in vanilla or requesting license for technology and improved puppet system where you can actually become free without going to war with your master. If you don't have DLC you will still be able to enjoy it in MP as if host has the DLC then everyone gets to use its benefits.although overall i recommend this game there are various issues most of which i wont name  like rare crashes during resync/hotjoin in multi and player chats getting bugged after hotjoin. also a personal thing i find mildly missing is that the way the game works so far is that every war except finnish soviet war has to end through one side surrendering unconditionallywhich usually results in the other side annexing or puppeting the defeated  countries entirely (offering peace function is a rare opportunity and either allows you to leave war unaffected or be fully vulnerable to being annexed fully). while i understand that this is an era of total war i'd find it nice if a losing side could offer peace with some minor concessions whilst rest of their land is guaranteed intact. also i dont think the abstraction of a country's economy into a number of civilian factories is the best way

Timtim	Not Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/berrypunny/	Absolutely awful execution by Paradox.  I really wanted to like this game.  I really did.The lack of core gameplay is horrendous.  The UI is horrendous.  The detail (or lack thereof in this case) is horrendous.It's like they took everything from HOI3 that was good (combat and OOB management for me) and proceeded to shave off as much as they could while still implementing it in the game.If you liked HOI3, DO NOT buy HOI4.
gyghyt	Not Recommended	95.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098107509/	Fun for a while... then the bugs and advertised different historical routes are not found or are dry flavor text.  Bug fixes and game improvements hiding behind DLC is a bad move man. Fix your act.
Th3_Imm0rtal	Not Recommended	315.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Th3_Imm0rtal/	As many have stated before, HOI4 is a fun game to play if you are relatively new to the series and just want to mess around. However, when you really look at the gmae closely, you tend to notice a lot of issues that have yet to be fixed or even added to the game a year after its release.Cons-The AI is laughable. So bad that CIV VI AI looks good. Grand battle plan just doesn't work. The units that you have carefully placed along the French border? All decided to come together at one district, or just hopscotch between districts because AI doesn't know what "forward advance" means, thus leaving an entire front wide open for flanking. Or better yet, the AI will reorganize its army to have reinforcements go to a part of the front that does not require any reinforncements, thus leaving the crucial part of the front that actually needs reinforcement, wide open for being overrun.-Bordergore. If you want to see some art..er I mean...unfathomable and illogical map carving, I encoruage you to check it on Reddit or simply Google it.-Lots of minor nations are just meh, and not entirely enjoyable to play. It'd help if they had some interesting focus trees that does not require me to shell out $10-$15 just to "enhance" my gameplay-Some of the major powers don't feel exciting to play, especiialy when you comapre the focus trees to what the Community offers (Look at Vanilla Gemrany focus tree and then look at Edelweiß's "Germany Techtree overhaul. It offers way more focuses that are logically and fun to use, rather than some lackuluster focuses.)-DLCs are overpriced for what they barely offer. I don't understand why I should pay $10-$15 for game features that should have been in the game Day 1, as well as play nations that should have had their focus tree fleshed out from the start. Seriously, just to play any other Commenwealth nation (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and India), have the concept of Autonomy (become an independant nation) in play, as well as Battle Combat Logs, One new tactical attack option, and Tech sharing, you need to cough up $15. Paradox...dude, you're like EA now.Pros:-I honestly can't think of a postitive thing since the things that I like about this game, is greatly overshadowed by the amount of trouble and bugs that this game has. Maybe the workshop and the mods that are offered? Yeah that's the actual good thing about this game. The modding cumminuty that actually fixes the game and makes it interesting.TL:DR-Game is fun if you never played HOI before, and do not give a crap about some missing features. However, if you want said features (that should've been present since Day 1), expect to pay up half the price of a AAA title just for some few lines of codes to work in your game, and maybe some interesting/lackluster nations to play.EDIT: Oh and they also jacked the price up in some regions, thus nullifying the benefit of a Summer Sale. Expect Jim F-ing Sterling-son to make a video about this.

justininho	Not Recommended	299.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993791840/	Its complexity is undermined by one basic, yet major flaw, that needs fixing as it slows down everything: you only pay to build not to maintain.As there's no wages to pay, and as the economy doesn't take a hit from a conscripted workforce - it chugs along so long as it's functioning - there's no reason to disband units once the war is over, so the game gets bogged down because all the AI does is build more units if the popcap lets it. Every game has ended with a massive war between the USSR and Chinese on a front that extends from Tibet to the Kamchatka Peninsula with Japan being a puppet of one or the other. That's a big front with a lot of divisions constantly fighting. At the same time I was surprised to see Canada felt the need to field 12 division in the Yukon, New Zealand had 40 division spread over two islands, so on and so on,This means that fighting or not there's a lot of divisions that move, train, re-equip, entrench etc. That's a lot of calculation. Too much to make it satisfying in the long term, unlike CK2, where war is financially crippling and keeps everyone operating according to their incomes. NZ with 40 divisions? Don't even try to make eye contact with me if you think NZ could afford to maintain 400K+ men in the field as a standing force all year. They would go broke in a week.There also need to be overhauls in the navy and airforce (maneuvers, upgrading vessels and keeping crews, more research - not just vessels, mulberry harbours, firing drills, better ammunition, bomb sights), there should be spies stealing battle plans, sabotaging nuclear programs, leaking false plans to lure defenders from positions.The game also dies historically: Where is Ghandi? Tito? Castro? Gulags? Palestine/Israel? Deathcamps and Waffen SS units Where are the anti-colonial uprisings in Africa and Asia? Vietnam? Algiers? I played my first game until 1970, waiting for the war to end (German-Polish War - just between the Russians and Chinese) and none of these appeared.Finally: It plays at being complex but it's not a complete game. It needs to get married to Victoria 2 and have a baby and then be schooled by CK2 and EU. Buy on sale.

Boromir	Not Recommended	370.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/boganisvej/	I enjoy this game alot! However, I think that, like EU4, much of the DLC-content should be considered as 'must-have-content' in the base game. For exampl, the images, textures and content of lesser nations are being sold as add-on content. For a game prized at +40 Euro (for both the base game and the DLCs) I think that this game is obvisously spilting its basegame-content to be sold as DLC-content, in relation to the prize in contrast to content. Again, i enjoy this game immensely, but I hate it when Paradox does this to their fan base.

Yureina	Recommended	206.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Yureina/	I decided to pick this up during a sale recently, having heard that HoI4 was more a return to form after... whatever HoI3 was. Based on my experiences with the game so far - and by that I mean overplaying it like a lunatic, I would say that they have done well in this regard.People who know Paradox games already have a good idea what this is all about. The main difference, of course, is that this is much more focused on conflict rather than empire-building. The war aspect is far more in-depth than anything found in CK2 or EU4, and much attention is also given to production and developing technology for different types of weapons. While the game still has the usual diplomacy and other not-war things, your primary focus is to make it through the global catastrophes of the early-mid 20's Century.But... this isn't just a simulation of WW2. Something that really made this game go from being a new release in an old franchise to an impressive beast of its own is the way that you can really screw with historical events. The "National Focus" system is the way that you get yourself extra bonuses and to make the sorts of political moves that occured during this time period. It is through this system that you do stuff like re-occupy the Rhineland, prepare for future conquests, or gradually draw your nation further into the war. It also allows you to... completely screw with history and do things that absolutely did not happen in reality. Want Germany to off Hitler and return to the rule of the Kaiser? Japan to go Democratic and join the Allies? The USSR to overthrow Stalin and see the return of Leon Trotsky? The USA to build itself up for a war against Britain? These are just some of the many examples of things you can do through this system.To top it off, you can toggle an option before you start your games to determine whether or not you want to force the other nations to stick to their "historical paths" and do what they did in reality... or not to. All you have to do is toggle that option off and you may very well end up in a very different sort of WW2.That alone, to me, is reason enough to check out this game since it makes things far more interesting and unpredictable than past HoI games while still leaving players the option to have things stick to history. But the generally high quality of the game as a whole only helps this along further. Does it have some issues? Yes. Despite how much time I've dropped into this game so far (nearly 200 hours), there is still much I haven't been able to get to work out for me (above all, how to not suck as China). But, as with all Paradox games... this one is going to keep getting patches and updates for quite a while. I expect what issues do exist to get cleaned up before long.So if you like Paradox games, this is another good one to check out. Beware however... this game can eat time and make you find yourself awake at crazy hours far far too easily. x_x
ひし	Recommended	502.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198115404363/	My experience with this game is quite fascinating and frustrating. Review and gameplay experince as below:You play as one of the major nation leader before or during the WW2 period. Research new technologies for your military purposes.Build infrastructure for a better transportation and resources or equipments to your army divisions. Build Air base, Anti air and Radar station if you get paranoid with the neighbouring country. Position your army to the border as the German Reich is massing a total number of 60+ divisions at their border with the seemingly plan of invasion. But they signed the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, everything is going to be just fine.Years passed, it is the year 1941, German Reich had already invaded and successfully capitulated both France and Poland with the help of other Axis members. Their Blitzkrieg tactics are going strong as they move their attention to the north and the middle east, Norway had requested help from the Allies against the mighty german wehrmacht naval invasion. Their best hope is Great Britain which are close to them. Heck, Mr.Churchill had already had enough problems to deal with the luftwaffe's strategic bombing. I don't think he can spare any troops to aid Norway. The capitulation of Norway is imminent. Meanwhile at the african theather, Benito Mussolini continues his territorial expansion.Late 1942, At the other end of the world, Chinese United Front hold Japanese army into a stalemate situation.The japs realized Just when things couldn't get much worse, A newspaper report states that the United States of America controlled hawaiin island, a harbor named "Pearl Harbor" were attacked by the Japanese Pacific Fleet and their carriers CAS accompanied by fighters.The United States of America decided to declare war on Japan. Did I mention that Japan is a member of Axis too? Great Britain  sent a call to arms request to The United States of America seeking for war aid. They accepted the request. But it need a long time for the United States Army to reach Europe. Where the seas are littered with german U-Boats, capable of sinking ships with torpedoes while being technically invisible to the Allies. They must find a way to overcome it.Mid 1943, German Reich controls most of mainland europe by this time. Should I start to intervene with this aggresive territorial expansion? perhaps, perhaps. As the Leader of Comintern, Spain are facing a threat of being invaded by the german reich. I wonder why the german reich didn't declare war on Spain, maybe it's because of Spain's faction, Comintern. The United States of America is still being held back by the german U-boats but their invasion is progressing quicker than I have expected, Perhaps this is the most suitable time to declare war on german reich and its allied countries with the reason "Aggresive territorial expansion and poses a threat to the Soviet Union.(ME) Sure, why not? I have more than 1 Million manpower and more than enough army equipment to safely invade German Reich. Everything is going to turn out just fine.1944, I have greatly underestimated the german army, I thought that I can blitzkrieg my way to Warsaw, and Berlin. Use their tactics against themselves. It'll be swift and simple, I expected little resistance on the polish border. The first few weeks of the invasion is going great with little and no resistance because of the inexperienced garrison army. But then, the much more experienced and better equipped german army clashes with the might of the Red Army. NO ONE WILL STOP THE RED ARMY ADVANCING. NO ONE. I was wrong, they didn't only stops the advance of my army, they also pushes back my army, back to my own border. Now I must confront the german army inside my own border. Just when the german army seek to advance into Moscow, Winter struck. Good news? No. The german army's momentum didn't stop for winter. They give no ♥♥♥♥s for winter. Just when they are about to march in heavily fortified and garrisonned Moscow. The United States army arrived at multiple port as their naval invasion target. At least that's what our code breakers told me. The German army had to draw some of their divisions back to the western front, leaving moscow with just a few dozens of divisions. Never I have been so grateful for United States misdirection.[WILL CONTINUE TO UPDATE]

Pickle Beard	Not Recommended	705.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AdolfIsMyDad/	If there was a maybe option, I'd give this a maybe recomendation. The game is good. Yet, the game feels abandoned to a degree by Paradox, having played Stellaris it feels as if they have neglected some aspects by way of comparison. It is also strictly a war game, whereas Stellaris feels as though it has greater diplomatic/economic/event aspects to the game. The game also does a good job at trying to jew you with dlc second only to the Total War franchise. But, at its core it is a very fun game, and on top of that it has a good modding community. However, without extensive mods I don't think I would have played this game past 100 hours. So all in all, by comparison to other Paradox games I'm not sure this is their best; however, if you are a fan of Paradox, or a WW2/Modern History fan, then go ahead and pick this up. Also I'm updating this to warn you that this crashes more than any other Paradox game I've played. 6/10

You can buff Germany all the way and they still can not kill the Britain. They make troops constantly whenever they can instead of resupplying their other troops. They are stupid and so easy to beat. Also, the multiplayer peace conferences are broken when having players of more than 2+ involved. But sadly, the game has no fun to it because of the stupid Ai. The AI are programmed to give newbies a hard time. If you have basic knowledge of the game you will trash the Ai. I mean, I took over the world as early as 1945 on ironman mode. Thats how easy it is.

sovy99 (Fabio)	Recommended	668.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061128524/	I must say this game surely has flaws (the AI could be improved a bit) and probably a bit too many DLCs (this is surely not the only game to have this problem)...What I must say on the other hand is that this game gave me hundreds of hours of gameplay and I didn't even explore every single aspect and  of campaign. There is the possibility to plan everything in detail and trying to follow an historical course of actions or you may try to completely change history and have a casual playthrough alone or with your friends online (I must say the multiplayer lobby system improved from Hearts of Iron III).The game mechanics are not difficult to understand but can take some time to fully master and organise.Overall I recommend this game as I didn't found a similar one that can fully compete with this game in the genre (my personal opinion, don't destroy me please).P.S. Don't attack the Soviet Union during winter
Spitfire	Recommended	155.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SupermarineSpitfire/	The best Hearts of Iron game by far, and probably the best WWII grand strategy ever.

I lose the respect.
Atreides	Not Recommended	482.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043685721/	TLDR: The game can be fun at times, but because of aspects of it being underdeveloped, prepare for many frustrations.Edit partly through a playthrough as China: -The frontline bug seems to happen if s front get's split. A ridiculously high part of the troops get sent one way (sometimes even to unreachable encircled areas), leaving huge holes in the other area. Also peninsulas and such are not always recognized as land connections.-If for example you invade Denmark from Sweden as China, with fully developed infrastructure through Russia, the AI will regardless sent all the suplies over sea instead of over the strait between Malmö and Kopenhagen. Not suspecting this and focussed on another part of the front, I found half a million of my men overrun (instead of Northern Germany occupied by me) and an already long game protracted with probably another few years.The AI should be improved and/or an option added to redirect supply routes.-The late game is underdeveloped. With 40 million losses as China and an equivalent by the the rest of the world (apart from previous wars with also many millions of casualties on all sides) there is no sign of anyone having manpower-problems. The late game is basically just making one big frontline, having a war of attrition and moving the frontline very slowly forward...World War 1 basically, not World War 2. Also especially the AI-Allies will make tens of thousands of planes, besides still having enough IC to make vehicles and equipment.My negative review stands for now, for even though the game can be fun, having entire armies overrun because of aspects of the game being underdeveloped (despite the game having been delayed a long, long time to prevent this) thus ruining many hours of gameplay is sloppy. This needs to be improved and once again, not by paid content.Here some more pictures to illustrate the review:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=803339501http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=803339578----------------------------------------------------Though the first hours are fun, bad AI and some bugs start being a major annoyance after a few runs. I've added some screenshots to illustrate this. Seeing these things happen after a careful buildup of hours (especially the AI frontline bugs), makes singleplayer feel like wasted time. Defeating the Soviet Union and Allies as Germany in the first try should have been a sign when I made my first (then positive) review that the AI is insufficiently developed. Hopefully this will be fixed by patches (and by that I don't mean paid features). http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=785967206http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787457520http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787457486http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787457583http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787457627http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787457545 
Turk Pasha	Not Recommended	645.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Turko-Slavic/	HOI4 is a good game, and if I have to rate it I would give it 8/10 score. But some minor issues really ruin the game. If you want a game like EU4 in WW2 then this game is for you. However if you want a realistic WW2 game, this game lacks those mechanics since it doesn't focus anything about realism.Pros:-Way easier to play when compared to HOI3.-No more annoying economic system as in HOI3 that every minute you had to change trade deals with nations etc. Trade is easier and less of a headage now.-Armies are commanded by AI (unless you change the direction manually) even though they have flaws, the army is way easier to command when compared to complex system in HOI3.-Air Force and Navy is way easier to be commanded.-Way easier to do airborne and naval invasions.-Good production system: making weapons, tanks, planes and ships etc.-National Focus Tree.-Tech Tree is better and easier to understand compared to HOI3.-National Modifiers.-Civilian and Military Factories.-Sending countries volunteers.-Map is better and more efficient.-Way easier to do Mods and publish mods.Cons:-Thailand never gets their historical claimed territory back like Japan gave them during WW2.-No Hatay for Turkey.-Geography is wrong (50% Turkey is desert and South American geography is wrong, similar to Turkey).-Pacific Islands size were enlarged but Malta and rest of the non-Pacific Island sizes stay in original size.-Greeks have core (not even claim) over Istanbul despite the fact that they were in Balkan Pact which prohibits members from having claim to each other.-No shape or form of Balkan Pack aka Balkan Entente.-It is super easy to change countries’ ideologies with simple coups, you can make USA communist less than 1 year if random communist countries like Mongolia or Communist Uyghurs support you since USSR and Mongolia or Bhutan all has same influence power.-PP system turned the game into arcane game rather than realistic version that was used in HOI3. PP turns the game more like EU4 feeling rather than typical HOI series feeling.-Army, Naval and Air experience also turns the game into arcane game. You need “army experience” to add radios or first aid kids to your soldiers. Or you need “naval experience” to modify your ships instead of Money and Resources.-Only 1 ruler by nation instead of having accurate cabinet that was used in HOI3 representing a realistic view on government. -Fascist Turkey is called Neo-Ottoman Empire, Fascist Bhutan is called something Dragon and Fascist Azerbaijan called Land of Fire etc.-When you promote a general into field marshal they magically forget everything they have learned.-There is only General and Field Marshall making AI just having 1 or 2 huge♥♥♥♥♥armies with Field Marshalls and making Generals useless. -Only 4 ideologies, Democracy (Super Vague), Fascist (Would be nice if they had nationalists also), Communist (Would be nice to also have socialists), Neutral (It should be changed to monarchist and religious imo)-Nepal, Bhutan and any other country can make Nuclear Weapons easily given time.-We have a DLC about Commonwealth that gives focus tree to New Zealand and South Africa but still nothing about China… nor Balkans…-Soviets get to claim Istanbul, Bursa and Izmit magically by Focus Tree, but not Eastern Turkey… They can only get Eastern Turkey in something to do in German Focus tree. The one of the biggest reasons why Turkey decided to join Allies and NATO was due to Stalin’s claim on Eastern Turkey that he wanted to give Armenia SSR which ofc GAME DOESN’T INCLUDE cause Istanbul, Bursa, Izmit and even some Greek islands are for some reason magically more legit for Soviets to claim. -Azerbaijan got no claim in Northern Iran when it is filled with Azeri population. So when they took those lands they loose half of the benefit since people of that location are hostile against them, just like when Turks who have 90% same culture takes those places :DDD, but hey if Greeks take Istanbul (which is 95% turkish in this time), Turks will convert to Hellenic race instantly :D-No Anglo-Soviet Invasion of Iran in 1941 in focus tree-Dlc's are expensive and does not  add overwhelming game change mechanics.

I couldn't understand HOI3 anyway.The game introduces new interesting features such as the political mechanics which are a lot of fun as well as other interesting parts. If you like stratergy adn WW2 but HOI3 was too complex this game is for you, and even if you are a HOI purist this game is still good fun.Looks amazing and from my experience runs pretty well most of the time (excpet for when huge♥♥♥♥♥♥is going on all over the world, or you're doing multiplayer online with♥♥♥♥♥♥internet).Overall, good game, great fun, needs improvement, beware of the oncoming dlc storm.

Peace treaty system is utterly broken so it ruins the ending of every game.They need to fix, I'll swap my review to positive when they fix that massive bug that should have been a deal breaker before releasing the game. There are literally 1000s of forum comments about this... (hint hint - fire your QA team for missing their on nose on their face).
Kryptech	Recommended	403.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198109412497/	Hearts of Iron 4. Where to start. Well. I guess... So apparently something like 40% of players roll the German Reich. Now. I'm all about some Thousand Year Reich every now and then, but I can't help but wonder what that says about the player base.Anyway.I freakin LOVE this game. If you want a really good game, dont take the bait. You dont need the military might of the Reich to have fun (although it is pretty satisfying to watch your panzer divsions roll through Belgium and France in less than six weeks). Personally, the best time I've had here is taking Australia, wrecking up the Japanese in China then making safe North Africa from the predations of the faulty Italians and the ever efficacious Germans. OR, be the Japanese, roll over the US Navy and make good your plans of invading mainland US. Equally, I've had a damn fine time invading the USA (maybe there's a theme emerging here...), and subsequently mainland Britain as Fascist Canada (which is entirely possible, by the by). I'm a big alternate history nut, so, going fascist as the Russian Empire, going democratic as the Republic of Germany etc really gets me going (and all of that is possible too!). Look, basically, if you have any slight interest in World War Two, or any of the politcal implcations relating to such, this is the game for you. There's a lot of talk about AI etc, but damn it, I've had a lot of fun with this game, and I've lost a lot of hours to it where I should probably have been doing something constructive with my life. All I can say to you is this, dopn't play this game just before bed, because one of two things will happen. 1, you'll still be awake fighting the USSR at 0300 in the morning or, 2, you'll go to bed and roll around planning your next tactical maneouvres until 0300.I really want to have an input on the Mods for this game too. Goddam. Let me say, (with a quick shout out to these two mods and no, I'm not endorsed) Kaiserreich and The Great War mods are flippen ace. There's just so much talent out there, working to make every new game of HoI4 a fun and different experience. Not to mention the dedication of the develpoers (Paradox) themselves, who tirelessly and lovingly update and release new content to keep the game fresh and exciting. Going back to some of my favourite times on this game, rolling Austria-Hungary and being a competent ally to the German Empire in The Great War is awesome fun.I REALLY need to mention the multiplayer as well. Ever though that you could have done better than the Allies? Or the Axis? Or thought the Balkan States could have been bigger players in the era? Ever thought that Brazil, Argentinia and Venezuela should have had an impact on the world stage? Well, holy moly, get your bestest buds together and make that happen! TL;DR this game is good, really good. As long as you have an interest in the war itself, or any passing interest in alternate history. Yes, its has issues, but doesn't every game? At least Paradox are well reknowned for staying with thier titles and expanding / imprivng them. Can't go far wrong with this, as far as I'm concerned. The modding community alone is utterly ace, and well done to all of them. Damn fine effort.What are you waiting for? End your foolish appeasment and get your war on!
Blimp	Not Recommended	258.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ColonelBlimp/	The difference between this game and HoI2/Darkest Hour is the difference between new LEGO and old Lego. Old Lego you got a bucket full of pieces and you could make whatever the pieces let you make, new LEGO you make a racecar or whatever and thats it.The racecar is fun and everything, for a little while at least, but its not really LEGO, and this isn't really Hearts of Iron.
Herbie316	Recommended	298.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079770936/	Guys, you don't need to buy DLC. DLC is honestly not worthit and the workshop has achieved so much more. Paradox's DLC isn't worthit but, isn't manditory either. No need to buy the DLC to enhance the game, just get a mod from the workshop (Road to 56, KaiserReich, Great War Mod). The game is great with a some derpy AI but, once you have gained some expertise Multiplayer can prove to be alot of fun. Just to clarify, once again, DLC is not by a long shot needed and will enhance the game marginally. In my opinion, best WW2 sim and I would definitely reccomend to anyone fanatical or even interested in WW2.
StannisRex	Not Recommended	76.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981012727/	I've sunk many hundreds of hours into Paradox games over the years, particularly HOI 3 and Vic 2. HOI 4, unfortunately, tried to streamline and automate so many things that this game ends up a boring, frustrating mess. The production system, however, is really cool. Although there are some major realism problems with resources and unit upkeep, it's a big step forward from HOI 3.tl;dr -- if you care at all about realism and history or even just playing a functional wargame, play something else. If you want to conquer the world as Poland or whatever it is that 14 year olds like nowadays by drawing arrows on a map and waiting for a time counter to click down, then this might be the game for you! -- AirAir was tedious in HOI 3, no doubt. The solution, replacing province-level air with "air regions," is not much better. Besides lacking flavor, you lose a tremendous amount of tactical felxibility with your air due to these zones.  Say you're invading France. "Northern France" is one air zone, and your fighters can only reach about half of it, so they get a -50% air superiority malus, so you need, say, 4000 planes to be on equal terms on the frontline against 2,000 French planes. Apparently your planes just go sightseeing around Brittany instead of fighting on the frontline. Why can't I concentrate my fighters just over where the battles are being fought? Why can't I focus my bombers on the breakthrough point instead of having them bomb random 1 division vs. 1 division battles that.The air war is also horribly bloody, largely due to the "accident" system. As a baseline, you lose 2% of your planes every time they fly a mission, and they fly 2 missions a day. There's also no officer/pilot pool in the game at all, so you never run low of pilots until you run out of manpower. (This also means every country in the world has an equally plentiful and well-trained officer corps, which is obviously beyond silly.)Ground AA, despite being incredibly important IRL, is once again useless/a joke.-- NavalI admittedly haven't played much with the naval system, but there are a couple dumb oversights. For example, you can't force your navies to retreat, your admirals don't retreat even if horribly overmatched, and if you send a fleet back for repairs, it will sail right back out unless you CONTROL clicked on repair. I didn't notice this and lost my entire fleet because I thought the ships would stay in port unless I ordered otherwise. Nope, they repaired and immediately wandered out, got attacked by the entire British fleet, and sat there for weeks getting massacred and I couldn't make them retreat. Also, the AI isn't smart enough to move its ships if they're being port striked. In one game, I sank the entire RN by getting air superiority and then port-striking for months, while the computer just sat its ships there getting bombed instead of rebasing them to say, Scapa Flow or Gibraltar or ANYWHERE.-- LandThe "battle planner" system is an abortion, and the game forces you to either use it or (essentially) take a significant combat malus because of the massive "planning" bonus it gives you. Apparently, unless a 4-star takes weeks "planning" an offensive (or defensive), your lower officers just march randomly into the enemy's fire. Of course, the battle planning AI, even after the recent fixes, still shifts units around seemingly at random and generally leads its troops like an ADHD 5 year old with a shiny new toy. Good thing they've got that planning bonus!The supply and weather/terrain system is also a disaster. Supply basically doesn't matter, you can jam zillions of divisions in the middle of the desert and, if you even DO get low supply, they don't run out of fuel/lose org/move slower, they just get a combat malus. You can encircle divisions and it can take weeks to de-org them if they're well-entrenched and in decent terrain because they only get a -33% penalty for not having any food or bullets.Want to attack Moscow in January? No problem, you've got plenty of supplies and your frostbite casualties are instantly replaced by troops teleporting straight in from Berlin. Worried about mud or snow bogging down your panzers? Don't be silly, little things like that won't slow you down! No oil? Don't worry, your tanks never run out of gas, it just takes a little longer to build new ones!
Andrew the Jew	Recommended	840.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/andrewstetson/	The most complex WWII game mixed with the non clunky smooth userface unlike most paradox games makes for hell of a game. Also this one of the the few paradox games where the DLC isnt absolutely neccesary. I actually recomend playing the game without it at first becuase it makes the game more complex

loki1944	Not Recommended	89.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197983131478/	This would be a fantastic game if it wasn't for some quite terrible and baffingly obtuse gameplay mechanics decisions; almost like the devs couldn't be bothered with getting the basics right. As it is the game sports some aggravating direction with stupid stuff; like sending units over water to do a landing somewhere, you have to click the the port then clickon on where you want to land... and don't forget to press enter. And then watch as 8/10 times the units that are IDENTIFIED by the game as being the ones to follow that nifty looking arrow across the water, just sit there for eternity. I mean really? This should be something simple and dependable, not needlessy obtuse, with a dash of not working. Stuff like this is just plain sloppy. Also the supply system seems fairly worthless to me; AI will sit in the Sahara desert thaking no attrition all day while encircled and/or cut off from ports/airfields. for weeks That's just gamey right there.
gyzbug	Not Recommended	1,008.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008019227/	Updated after playing with Patch 1.3.1There are still Constant AI issues and bugs are making the game very frustrating to play.  With 1.3.1 there are now new game crashing bugs reported on the forums constantly.  Once again the current ETA is months before a fix is ready but they are aware of the issues.Information in-game still requires new players need to read guides and manuals on all major powers before starting to avoid losing due to a political objective being completed.  Also read up on current guides for all combat mechanics since many are hidden and you have to know what is happening without the game telling you.  They still dont teach players about army width limits, Airwing size limits, and Fleet Size limits.Again more patches are coming to fix issues and SHOULD have many of the bugs, exploits, and AI issues fixed in the coming months after the they get back from vacation.Will update review if things improve or new pathes come out.

Dendrofiili	Recommended	478.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118510702/	This being my first review of a game, i think people are being too harsh on Hearts of Iron 4. It's a solid game, which of course has it's flaws. Played it for a good 160 hours and went through lots and lots of different routes of finishing the war.Communist Brazil, not a good idea, with 'Murica being so close by.Fascist Finland and Fascist Norway turned out really nice.Communist China is OP with it's manpower edge over everyone else.Australia doesn't have any manpower, so that screws it up for some extent.And apparently Hungary is the one that beat the Soviets on the big Soviet aggression towards Hungary. While Hungary causing WW2 by wanting parts of Czechoslovakia.Anyway. The game is really good and way too addicting. And with a few fixes from Paradox, it can be great again.The AI needs a rework, as you can easily block off their 20-30 divisions who aren't concerned about the fact that you're about to cut off their supplies, and the AI doesn't really wanna push for positions too much. It still strives on invasions though, and to some extent it's getting annoying as hell when they come in from places you didn't even know existed. And also the scoring system needs a rework. Britain and 'Murica winning every time by winning every air battle there is (6500 planes over Northern France for 10 years, bombing German areas tends to do that).I'll just say this. The game is worth the cost. It's fun as solo, even more fun in multiplayer and if you're a fan of the franchise, the game is simplified alot, but not too much.

Change history is what I meant.And then.... then we have mods. Hundreds, thousands of mods to enjoy and change up your game.The only things I have to talk about that are negative are the rather... uh... incompetent AI and the 'not too good' Multiplayer netcode.Its pretty much not possible to consistenly play on highest speed and depending on distance (ping) not even the 4th or 3rd of the 5 speed levels.And about the AI:I assume they gotta work on that more. It already got 'better'.But its still alltogether a great game in my opinion and as long as there are free mods that are WAY better than the DLCs from Paradox that you have to pay for but do not offer enough for the price, I look at you 'Together for Victory', I will keep playing it...I hope I helped you with this review at least a little on the decision of buying this game or not. :)
Crokey	Not Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197990657943/	If you enjoyed HOI3 you will hate this game. All depth and complexity have been stripped out to the point where the mechanics consist of an idiotic AI using your units slugging it out with an equally stupid enemy AI controlling their units. Nowhere is this more obvious than in the truncated Order Of Battle where instead of being able to group your units and assign them to Corps where they can complement each other you are instead forced to pile all of your divisions (which you have much less control over the composition of) into unwieldy armies that you are all but compelled to hand over all control over to the AI (which as always does a terrible job).It would seem that rather than try to make a useful tutorial to explain the game mechanics to players Paradox threw the baby out with the bath water and just stripped out all of the potentially confusing mechanics to get mass market appeal.I can only hope that Paradox works some miracles in the patches/ expansion packs because at the moment there is very little to keep players interested for long.

"lets become facist". so i started growing facism in my nation and after a year i had an option to begin a civil war for facism, i though *yes, this is great, all i need is to defeat some democratic rebels and im good*.. turns out no, i became a tiny little nation at war with USA, and from national focuses i chose earlier, all of south america joined the americans and i thought, *surely im ♥♥♥♥ed*, i then had Adolf Hitler himself offer to join the war, at this point i was rather confused as i wasnt in a faction with the Axis but i though, hey, dont question it, after about 2 1/2 of playing, i won the civil war and became the Glorious facist USA and just as i was really getting into it and as i was ready to destroy the USSR...The great commander of the facist USA had to go for his dinner... goodbye life, hello HOI 4
Kugellehr	Not Recommended	558.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197962806112/	It's really unfortunate that a long time HOI gamer like myself, with literally over 1000 hours in HOI3, has to give HOI4 a bad review.  It's also been a trend in gaming lately, in that deep games are becoming increasingly simple.  HOI4 is just that: simple.  Sure its flashier.  But with that zazz that lost a lot of game play.  I feel the units are over simplified. Where are my garrison divisions?  Siege Artillery?  The ability to create your own divisions types are basically verboten until you're at war and have enough army XP.  The flashy animations are ok, but I'm a classic wargamer and liked my stacks of counters with Nato symbols.  I also liked my chain of command with HQ units, not one general only being able to command 24 units.  I feel I've really lost a lot of the customization in units and my armies overall.  Now they're just basically mobs of units that I dont feel are really mine.  You feel me? The game's production mechanism involving trying to build suffient numbers of types of equipment is rather nifty, however I feel thats just about all I do in the game is manage production, not run a war on every level.The AI itself was paltry at best.  On regular I took the soviet union without even trying, and the army AI you use to attack or defend does an atrocious job.  Japan took China without problems.  France fell in one week.   The tech tree is about as simple as simple can be, and ends in 1945, with very little variation.  I could go on and on but really, I think I'm just going to go play something else, this review is depressing me.  Why Paradox? Why?

mc3744	Not Recommended	504.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198032974499/	I’ve played them all. All the HoI and all Paradox games. EU and HoI my favorites.I’ve been expecting Hoi IV eagerly and I was sorely disappointed.The game is not bad, but it is worse than HoI 3. If you haven’t played it before you’ll like it. But if you have …Graphic looks better but it’s much worse in terms of usability.Some examples: you can no longer tell the strength of a division without clicking twice to get into the unit details. For instance, all Inf divisions look alike, whether they have one battalion or are at full strength. You can no longer identify your uber-heavy-division looking at the small numbers below. They are all alike. Sad. Annoying.Many map overlays remove the view of all the units, hence you cannot give orders while, for instance, looking at the resistance overlay.When you click on a unit you get the list of all the units assigned to the army, not the details of the unit. For that you need and additional click, in the right spot too.Unfortunately, I could go on and on with the UI deterioration. It looks nice simply because it’s new, but the previous one was way better.The AI has improved and working battle plans are nice … but.But, as clearly shown on the War on Wednesday videos, the AI is just not good enough and it requires constant micro managing. However, you no longer have the luxury of customizing what messages you get, hence you need to keep checking the map to make sure you don’t have paratroopers landing in your backyards while you are micromanaging a given area.Therefore, you can assign a front to the AI, but only if you are overwhelmingly stronger and you are in no hurry. Otherwise just do it yourself. It’s an eye candy, but the performance is not even comparable to a human player.You no longer get some nice little pictures, in the research screen, of the new panzer model or the new heavy fighter. You have some cartoonish like graphic, very generic and it gives to little to no satisfaction at all.No matter how big you get. You research capability will be capped at 5 slots. For instance, soon (1937 at most) Germany and Italy will have the same research capabilities. Regardless of the conquests, regardless of the starting point. It’s quite odd, especially considering the obvious bias of the videos’ dudes versus Italy on war on Wednesday. It was annoying and, apparently, for nothing too.And so on and so forth.Bottom line, IMHO this is the worst in the series. Still a decent game, but so much worse.

But the game is empty, it feels like missing something which is of course DLCs!. I hate Paradox's DLC policy thats for sure but I can understand them but this game (unlike the other game they released nearly the same time-Stellaris-)is just bland. Its DLC's are bad. And it has the look of the EA games that everything that matters or fun will be released as DLC which is from the look of it seems true. So if you're gonna buy this game just wait for a big sale and use lots of mods...
Peanut Butter Champ	Not Recommended	679.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198165069833/	Although I have 360 hours on HOI4 at the time of me writing this and I do love the game there are many issues. Such as worthless DLC. Paradox is pretty much famous for this at this point ill only be talking about the HOI4 DLC. Ok so first the "Together For Victory" DLC. so this DLC adds an autonomy system to the game and adds focus trees to commonwealth nations but first of all the focus trees are pretty much worse than generic because they are pretty much "go communist" "go facsist" go democracy" WOWEE THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOME REALLY FUN STUFF TO WASTE MY MONEY ON EVEN THOUGH ITS IN BASE GAME. Ok so second we have the autonamy system which I will admit is good BUT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BASE GAME. Ok so we have pretty much coverd the first worthless dlc "Together For Victory" so lets...... OH WAIT I FORGOT ABOUT ENSLAVING YOUR VASSLES. Ok now on to the second DLC "Death or Dishonor" so this dlc pretty much focuses on the balkens (ya know the most interesting region of the world' so it makes focus trees for the balken nations *cough cough should have been in base game* but all of the focus trees are overpowerd not in the fun way like playing ottomans in eu4 its more like using cheats in any game. so in most the focus trees u can make a faction or in hungary's case restor the australian hungary people empire. WOWEE THAT FUN AND NOT GONA GET BORING AFTER 10 MINUTES. so one last problem with HOI4 before I wrap this up THE GAME CONSTANTLY CRASHES. so me and my freind will be in a really fun game in HOI4 we will be having loads of fun conqoring the world together and just generaly having fun when suddenly........................................................................................................my screen freezes and i cant do anything...great. So i restart my HOI4 and load our last autosave ok nice were back in things and going well when a few in  game months pass by and then ............................ again freezes this then causes us to abandon the save to never play it again. I really do think that this game has potential but the paradox team just makes dlcs instead of making fixes to my or many peoples problems so if they stopped the worthless dlcs and fixed their game i think it would be 10 time better.so overall i dont reccomend this game. unless its on sale because this game is not worth 40$ its like 20$ at most so yea thats my opinion that nobody cares about bye.

Teoras	Not Recommended	205.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teoras/	I've owned the game for a while now, and I have to say, it's quite disappointing compared to the other titles. The AI just... doesn't work. It just doesn't. Frontlines are buggy in Africa, and sometimes your armies just decide not to have a frontline anymore, making the combat impossible. (Apparently, from what I've read, this bug has been around since at least 5 months ago. Great job, Paradox.)They don't try to update the AI, only small minor fixes. Yet, its 2018 and AI still lands 50 units in one province, and then not move them at all, because they are suffering from attrition. Or, what about Germany garrisoning all of their troops instead of helping their allies in the middle of their country? Or, how they don't... attack, for some reason, when the Soviet Union attacks them.Anyway, until Paradox realizes that they need to fix their AI instead of making more DLC's for features that should be in the main game in the first place, I'm going to leave this a negative review. 2 years and they still havent fixed the AI, like...  are you serious? That being said, the game is fun in multiplayer with friends... so... don't buy this game if you have no friends at all, I guess.

Jebus	Not Recommended	750.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/linktoid/	After playing Black ICE for HOI3 this was a big letdown. Basically the only thing that is good is the production system, literaly that one thing. If Paradox implemented it in HOI3 it would have been an awesome game. Instead they thought it would be a good idea to remove all the micro, and with it all the strategy. So, now you no longer need to (or indeed can) bother with planning your invasions based on things like terrain and weather (pfff... never used those mapmodes anyway right?!), setting up your OOB (you think Churchill bothered with assigning division commanders - hell no!) or keeping track of naval&air battles to see how your units compare to the enemy (whatever, its all up to god anyway). Instead of all this boring stuff you can now do fun things like: choose flashy colors and icons for your armies (pink and turquoise really bring out Rommels eyes...), laugh at the AI as it fails to implement your battleplan correctly (hehe... stupid AI...), and not notice when you get attacked and your borders get pushed back on the other side of Europe (at least those annoying popups are gone). On a serious note, this game feels rushed and empty, as if the devs planned something else, then failed and rolled back to this beta version. I only hope the modding community manages to make something usefull out of this catastrophy, otherwise paradox just robbed me of 40 euros.

At the state it is now, I find it incredibly more enjoyable than vanilla hoi3 and a tad more enjoyable than Black Ice.However, if we think about how this game will look like in a year, it's going to be amazing, the best WW2 strategy game ever. The BI team have already started working on this and modding has also been made easier by paradox.So for me, it's a 9/10.

TheLoyalAcorn	Not Recommended	643.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLoyalAcorn/	I love this game if you can't tell by how many hours I have played. I have to be honest unfortunately. This game is like any other paradox game and will kill you with DLC purchases. I believe one they finish this game with full DLC you'll pay roughly $200-$300. Personally I'm fine with it. You the reader are probably less inclined to spend this money. The upside to the DLCs is your paying this money over large periods of time with a few quality of life updates that come at no cost. Paradox isn't doing this to screw you over. They just realize in order to create a great game like this one it costs money and this is the best way to go about it. If you don't enjoy spending money but are still on the fence the modding community is great and you can still have hundreds of hours of gameplay without the DLC through the mods. I just would not recommend this game to the typical steam players who want a finished game with a one time purchase.

✪︎PappY	Recommended	517.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/IAmPappY/	this is my first time playing a paradox game, after seeing other recent hearts of iron games i saw it was a good game.Then i saw this game and thought if other hearts of iron games had amazing reviews i guess ill buy it and play this amazing game. i bought it 2 weeks after the release played as america just to test the settings and gameplay, blah blah blah.i played as germany and took over the world (it was on easy cus i was new xD) i played as england and stoped germany from taking france and played as axis america and helped germany win the war.in this game you can make history the same and not change it at all, or you can make your own history, in this game you can do anything, well maybe not anything but you know what i mean lol.you can play as axis russia, you can play as axia england, you can play as comunist america, democartic germany and much more.i give this game  a 7/10 If your wondering why i gave it a 7/10 its because of Multiplayer Multiplayer has lots of problems, the worst 2 are being stuck in the peace confrence and the host having to rehost the game, and when a player is a war for ex Communist france declars war on belguim, some players wont see the borers changing, they still see belgium.Well those a re 2 big problems, there a smaller ones, but Multiplayer takes 3  points :/7/10 i still recomend it
Mazza	Recommended	201.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966111962/	A worthy sequel to the HOI series. It takes a couple of hours to really get used to but the new way of issuing commands to army groups means that micromanaging your army while also dealing with grand strategy and the economy of your nation is no longer necessary. Thanks to this I can now see myself playing as large countries with multiple potential fronts and huge numbers of divisions to command (e.g. the USSR). I am sure there will be many DLC expansions and patches, but so far I have seen nothing egregious which I really miss or which is obviously broken - dare I say, ready to play on day 1?
Jebus	Not Recommended	750.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/linktoid/	After playing Black ICE for HOI3 this was a big letdown. Basically the only thing that is good is the production system, literaly that one thing. If Paradox implemented it in HOI3 it would have been an awesome game. Instead they thought it would be a good idea to remove all the micro, and with it all the strategy. So, now you no longer need to (or indeed can) bother with planning your invasions based on things like terrain and weather (pfff... never used those mapmodes anyway right?!), setting up your OOB (you think Churchill bothered with assigning division commanders - hell no!) or keeping track of naval&air battles to see how your units compare to the enemy (whatever, its all up to god anyway). Instead of all this boring stuff you can now do fun things like: choose flashy colors and icons for your armies (pink and turquoise really bring out Rommels eyes...), laugh at the AI as it fails to implement your battleplan correctly (hehe... stupid AI...), and not notice when you get attacked and your borders get pushed back on the other side of Europe (at least those annoying popups are gone). On a serious note, this game feels rushed and empty, as if the devs planned something else, then failed and rolled back to this beta version. I only hope the modding community manages to make something usefull out of this catastrophy, otherwise paradox just robbed me of 40 euros.

2SRL ThatBants	Not Recommended	175.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2SGames/	First of all, I REALLY like Hearts of Iron IV. And while I think the game itself is absolutely recommendable I will issue this a negative review for the simple fact that the DLC policy is rubbish.The content from both DLC "expansions" released so far offers you more possibilities on top of the vanilla game which by itself is great. What isn't great is that not only is the DLC content sparse in what it offers, but WHAT it offers is content that belongs into the base experience, like being able to puppet a nation when you release them instead of just plopping the nation back on the map which by itself felt unfinished.And if it wasn't bad enough that these little additions are paid for...both DLC's together add up to 24,98Eur!You can download mods such as KaiserReich which add a truly MASSIVE amount of content for completely FREE, by people who just love the game.To me as a customer this is a kick in the face. I'm all for DLC in games if it's done right. I don't mind paying for well crafted additions to a game but this games DLC content just feels lazy.I feel like this game could get incredibly far content and complexity-wise if the community just called out Paradox for what they are doing. Maybe they would spend time improving the main game while producing expansions on a bigger more content rich scale instead of what they are currently doing. (holding important additions hostage in overly expensive DLC).TL:DRA fantastic stategy game held back from reaching it's full potential by a bad DLC policy.

Been a fan of paradox for years now and this seems to be the most interactive and overall control of the entire war and peace effort much more than ever before. The game may be hard for beginners but tutorials and hints help novice players along the way, and if one doesn't like to wait for action they can start at the beginning of the war instead. The game is fantastic and I had to get it the first day, but my system may not be able to control a game with graphics and overall units that encompass the entire world. The game seems clunky at times, but after graphic readjustments my computer seems to do fine. Also, one thing I noticed right away was a discoloration that covers much of the world, I don't know if its just my computer, but it seems to be a large part of the map with pink, blue, green and red lines that cover a large amount of the world map if you zoom out. This discoloration blots out independent zones that denote country and national colors. Just thought I would add that to see if it's a bug or just my graphics card.

exosolar	Not Recommended	273.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027483701/	If you are going to play this game solo, it has a very broken AI right now.It does not work and is non-competitive.It is prone to doing really stupid things.I captured all of Africa with 4 divisions as an allied player.I saw France hold the German advance for 8 months, then promptly remove almost all units from the Country over a 4 day period.I saw Japan drive 90% through China and then remove all units to just give it back, including their own region to the north. I saw the British take half of mainland Italy in 1941, then left to go make a new landing in northern Belgium.I saw the German advance in Poland halted for two months as they seemed to have moved all frontline units somewhere else. Leaving holes, through which Poland took back some regions.As the Netherlands, I took most Germany after they declared war on me, but attacked France through the Maginot line, which was going very slowly. The AI will rotate low organization units a very long way back from the front (too far), so I kept surrounding and killing those units. Like Africa above, it has no ability to react to a threat, so as long as you go where it is not concentrated you can do whatever.As the US, I declared war on the Axis in early 1941, promptly took all of mainland Japan since almost all of its units were still in China. I tried tinkering with the available modding parameters that effect the AI, but there do not appear to be parameters to change many of these behaviors. Research is completely unnecessary since the starting units work fine against an  enemy that is ignoring you. Earlier post:Sadly, entirely disappointed with HOI 4, what a mess.I have thousands of hours in HOI 1-3, with the bulk of that in HOI 3. I play entirely solo since my schedule and blocks of time are irregular.Solo play in HOI 4 is a joke. The AI is entirely non-competitive.I have played through as two different majors, and have started short games with the others for a comparison.AI does not appear to have any unit upgrade plan, or worse maybe it does the research but never builds the units.AI ground units run in endless circles around the map, tying up convoy units in the process. Allied country units will show up and move through any of the player fronts as single units. Mostly they stop and sit somewhere for short while then move again. Sometimes they attack, badly, paying no attention to what you may be doing. They cannot hold any ground.Playing as the US, joined the allies, and they very quickly filled up all my airbases in the United States. I had UK Naval bombers sitting Kansas? Allied air unit deployment was everywhere on the map except where the ground units are actually fighting, so as far as I can tell they are useless under AI control. Never once were my ground units bombed or fighters challenged.Ground support shows animations of planes, but again no indication of the effect or even if there is one. Fighters are very much the same it appears they kill enemy planes but you have no idea how many or even if they are. This also means you have no way understand how many or where they should be deployed. For planes it appears your biggest enemy is attrition which seems to destroy a lot.You can build, deploy and assign bombing missions to strategic bombers, but there is no indication that they do anything. Without feedback how can you every understand the effect based on numbers, so 10 or 1000, all the same.Naval bombers do attack ships from time to time and appear somewhat effective.AI navies only sometimes make anything close to a real fleet. Fighting against Japan, I frequently faced isolated battleships, BC or 2-3 cruisers together. None of these had any screens so they easily fall to a well-built fleet or a submarine squadron. AI aircraft carriers after a while will be empty but still cruising around.The army and orders concept seemed like a good idea. The only time it has even a remote chance of working correctly is when it has one objective, from one army. You are forced to use this for any naval beach landing or para-drop operation. Once you have done one of these, you have quickly remove all units from the army and create a new army to get rid of any orders otherwise the AI starts doing something stupid. It does do a good job of rotating units in and out of the front line, although the low organization units sometimes wonder off a long ways and sit way too long.The AI can make a beach landing, then it plugs in a bunch of units and randomly attacks, it may attack left for a while, then change its focus to the right. It never appears to reinforce this zone, except for the wondering units. It never has a plan, which works in a stalemate sense if the defender is AI. The defending AI will counter-attack after a successful attack but it is not reinforced and only generally with the units on hand if even it is 1 on 10. Otherwise a defending AI does no attacking and shuffles its units around to keep the line somewhat balanced and loses.Jets are not on the unit upgrade path, so you end up build entirely new squadrons, bad.Modern tanks are also not on the upgrade path, so there is no flow to use those into existing units.You have multiple levels of radar, but no idea what they add or when.Balanced, non-historical tech tree sucks and should be entirely tossed. Total lack of unit variation between counties also entirely wrong, this is one big keys to making this a enjoyable military period.Balanced factories and resources suck any long term life out the game since all countries play the same.I see no hope of this ever being fixed, because right now there is nothing the AI does correctly, good thing I still have HOI 3.
Branko	Not Recommended	3,095.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020132012/	Well, some DLCs and expansions in, the game has been considerably fleshed out.In it's handling of air and naval warfare it is indeed a big step over HOI3, as it is in terms of stability itself (HOI3 simply kept crashing periodically). While some changes I did not exactly like, they are manageable...However, the game spectacularly fails in one important respect, which is really pivotal to the game. Land warfare and AI.Playing HOI4, the land AI is terrible and useless. This is over a year after the game's release. To paint you a picture, when I started the last game with little Greece, I decided I want to take Istanbul from Turkey.So, I start a war, and exploiting AI weakness park my troops behind a river on a mountain in big concentration. The AI bleeds itself white and wastes it's whole army charging a position it cannot possibly take, with the occasional one-division naval invasion adjecent to a port which gets wiped out due to not being able to get resupply.Once the AI has basically destroyed it's army and manpower reserve, I attack and soon Turkey capitulates.Then Italy attacks and cannot breach my lines and loses 2 million men in the process just charging into fortified mountain positions with understrength divisions. Basically, once the AI can't break a position it will only keep attacking, with less and less chance of victory as it's divisions get further depleted.

Between all the bugs and the horribly unoptimized performance, Paradox really should have focused on fixing all of these issues first before they ever thought of releasing a single DLC. Considering how all the same issues are still persisting while their new DLC is on its way, I am going to have to give a negative review for their obvious lack of respect for the gamer's experience and their unhealthy obsession with making more money through DLC. They can earn their right to charge more for additional content once they fix all of the issues present with the base game first.

We are over 4 months since the release and still the game is unplayable and if you manage to get a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game going that is somewhat balanced, the germans are always excessively weak, your allies will attack randomly and waste all their troops, equipment and manpower and accomplish nothing. They will declare wars on random countries after the war and never do anything about it.And even if you manage to win it all, be more succesful than the allies historically, the Russians will take it all even if you own 90% of the map. In my last game I won accross the board. I won the war with all of europe except poland and finland,  and everything else on the map that wasn't the, more or less, default russian borders. At the end of the game, Russia had over 4 times more points than me. Ironman game on normal.I feel like I was scammed.
Grorgrer Thudgebearim	Not Recommended	566.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuchiha/	Hearts of Iron 4 is a strange game. It has many good and bad elements to it, but ultimately it leads me to not recommend the game honestly. Simplification isn't necessarily a bad thing, and HoI4 did this in many good ways. Some of the 'complexity' of Hearts of Iron 3 was just confusing and unexplained UI. HoI4's UI is relatively clean and easy to use, with the exception of the air menu being clunky as hell, but not necessarily confusing. But other than that, my experience with the UI has been good.The graphics and artistic direction of the game however, I'm mixed on. I was originally against the combined map style, that combined terrain and political map modes. However I've gotten used to it, but it would be nice to have the option. Stellaris I've heard has the same problem in this regard, which is complete lack of map modes. There isn't even a VP (victory-point) map mode, which I feel is sort of critical.The game also suffers from spam, lots and lots of spam. You'll hear constant noises once the world war kicks of, and have constant alerts about naval and air combats. It is very annoying, I have no idea how this got past testing. Maybe it only annoys me but, I can't understand how anyone deals with it. Also something that is actually more complex than HoI3 is the production and logistics. Now you actually have to set production lines for various equipment (tanks, infantry equipment, trucks, etc.), you can also make variants of said equipment for better performance or specialty use. You make this equipment by setting up production lines and assigning factories. So you can produce very little of a specialty item, but mass-produce a cheap item very easily. Also these production lines use resources. But these resources don't matter, because units don't consume them. They're only used in the initial creation of the equipment, and that's it. You can have little oil, and still make tanks but at a slower pace. You can literally have zero oil in your country and not be importing any what-so-ever, and it won't affect your already existing tanks at all. This makes no sense, as the Axis alliance with Romania (Ploiesti) and their push to the Caucasus (Baku) was caused entirely by the need for oil to fuel their industries and also their armies. You will never face a crisis to get fuel for your army, or a need to make an urgent push towards oil refineries. Because your already existing tanks take no fuel maintenance. It can be argued that resources are important, which they are, but it's greatly diminished. However, your factories are very important. Without factories, you can't produce anything, not even basic equipment for your armies. Your production can be hindered in a number of ways, such as capture of factories or damage due to strategic bombing. So you need to keep at least some aircraft in reserve or at the home-front to intercept enemy bombers to not have less factories. Or you would have less, if the AI was there. The AI doesn't seem very good, and I'm not saying this as some sort of mastermind strategist (I only have 90 hours in HoI3 and never completed Barbarossa). But when in my first attempt, I defeated the Soviet Union as Germany, I didn't feel any sense of accomplishment. For me it was literally "draw a line and win", I drew a line in the battle-planner and let the divisions go. I could've had less casaulties and maybe did it faster if I had controlled my divisions manually, but, I feel the game is way too easy if I can literally set one line for Barbarossa and win. That, and when I did take Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad, there was no victory. It became a whack-a-mole type hunt to capture random Soviet cities that became their capital when their main armies were utterly defeated. Fun. And after all of that, the most infuriating part of my review honestly. Is the damned peace-conference system. You will almost see things like Yugoslavia annexing the entirety of Germany, or the AI taking random pockets of territory. As Germany I couldn't even take territory up to the Ural Mountains, I was forced to let Italy take some land when they participated very little. This is because of the system where you can't use up more "points" than the person behind you. So if you and the person in second place are very close, you can't do much. While if the person in third place has very little points (as is often the case, due to minors), it means the second-place person has basically free reign. Also one last point I wanted to make. This is purely my opinion, and I'm basing it off of what I know from previous Paradox titles (my first game was Crusader Kings 2). This game will be riddled with dlc, lots of it. There's so many missing things, major (espionage, national focus trees) and minor (portraits) that Paradox will not ignore. A sequel is meant to build off of it's predecessors, and HoI4 does that in many ways, but it feels some stuff is being left out for future dlc. One example is that HoI4 has less than 500 portraits (even counting portraits that are the same people w/ different clothes), while HoI3 had over 17,000 unique portraits...Ultimately I don't recommend Hearts of Iron IV. I enjoyed it, and will continue playing it, but I can't recommend it honestly due to its problems. I will not use, nor accept, "wait for the dlc". I shouldn't have to, and I don't know why this is such a popular argument. I might change this in the future as the game improves, because I definitely will keep checking in.
Delor	Not Recommended	183.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961372576/	Hearts of Iron IV is broken, plain and simple.  It's near impossible to review because the AI simply does not know how to play the game.  The simple basic task of researching along the tech tree and integrating new vehicles into its divisions is beyond it- expect lots of infantry and light tanks, and not much else.  The more complicated task of deciding which fronts to send units and in what quantity?  Forget about it.  Expect to see Germany conquer France, gift France away to Italy and Spain, and then assign all of its divisions to watch the neutral Soviet border and defend its African holdings as the Allies retake all of France, Italy, and Germany's SE European allies completely unopposed.  British conquering ports in northern Germany to land troops in?  Barely worth noticing, when some patch of desert in Africa needs men to stare into it from the border!  Given this, it's hard to even assess the other aspects of Hearts of Iron 4.  Ground combat seems to mostly work, naval and air combat less so, but if the AI can't even play the game little else matters.  The core game is actually very interesting.  The front system promises and mostly provides a convenient way to organize large quantities of men in a defense or assault, when the AI isn't needlessly shuffling units back and fourth from territory-to-territory and front-to-front like it's worried that its men will become couch potatoes if they don't constantly march.  The equipment production system and division design systems are delightful.  If in a year or two, the development team can teach the AI how to play the game, this could be a very interesting product.  I'm far more interested in it and it's future than Paradox's other recent unfinished dud, Stellaris.  For now, however, give it a pass- maybe in 2018 there will be something here worth giving a try.

The ability to create variants is all well and good but there just seems to have been a massive reduction in the technology tree.Lend lease has also got a big change in that items such as support or infantry equipment can be used seemingly without issue by any nation regardless of where it was made and where it ends up. You would have thought that countries using totally different scales of measurement not to mention design would find it difficult to integrate equipment, such as when the Germans tried to use the various pieces o captured equipment on the eastern front it was a logistical nightmare because they didn't have the parts.As others have commented the AI seems ridiculously simple, I am not a particularly gifted player and yet playing as Japan managed to coup Nationalist China, Australia and New Zealand as well as conquer Far East part of the Soviet Union all without angering any of the Allied nations perhaps because I wasn't attacking Nationalist China? Who knows.I've yet to try playing as one of the other major nations I just hope the final result for this game in a year or two is of a similar standard to HOI3 which I have put a considerable amount of time in to playing and hold in high regard.On a bright note I did find the ability to restrict which equipment was used by a particular division to be helpful as it meant rear echelon units could be restricted to the basic equipment and preserving the top quality gear for your elite formations. Perversely of course there seems to be no penalty switching from basic to level 3 infantry weapons which makes no sense because unless your forces are trained to use every weapon past and present in your arsenal how could they so easily switch between them? Granted there are common elements of all weapons but I fail to see how soldiers using bolt action rifles could easily switch to sub-machine guns without so much as an org penalty to reflect the need to familiarise themselves with the weapon.For now it's a no, but it'll get fixed I just would have prefered PDX to not have released Stellaris and HOI4 so close together.

Edelbrecht	Not Recommended	322.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961578221/	Its hard for me to say but DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!.Its a broken piece of garbage and at its current state is only suited for multiplayer matches cause then you do not have to get frustrated by the veryveryvery stupid AI.Does this game has any plussides? Yes and no. It has good ideas but the execution of those ideas is lacking and amateurisch at least. We always get the promise from paradox that the problems will get fixed in the next patch or paid dlc. But I have had enough. The base game is just not good and badly developed. Its just to dumbed down and buggy.A few examples.1)If you can avoid a war long enough you can steamroll the AI. This because troopupkeep is non existent (all the sliders from HOI II and III are gone). Because of that flaw the AI will continue to produce troops (until he used up all of his manpower) and place them at the borders. Then attrition kicks in so he starts losing preciously build equipment. So after a few years you have AI countries that have massively huge armies with hardly any equipment left. In previous games you had to stop building units at a certain point because you economy could not keep them up anymore.2)Armycreation is so dumbed down that I have the feeling that paradox was just plain lazy and then made a pissjob doing it.In HOI III you could create divisions (some had unique names like ss units etc), armycorps, armies, armygroups and theaters with an entire commander tree in place. Mj General, Lt General, General, Field MarshallIn IV you build a division jam them in an army and assign them to a commander and theater. Theaters are useless they are just in place so that your lower toolbar doesnt get crammed with army portraits. Then they implemented a nice feature called the frontlines and defensive lines etc. Its nice but you have to assign each army with its own frontline and on a large front becomes very tedious. And the AI isnt helping either. Once you start gaining ground to lines shift so irraticly that you are managing more the frontlines then your armies cause overextending happens a lot. So something nice done horribly wrong.3) Aircombat and Naval Warfare are broken as hell.The creation of aireal units with officers is gone. Just jam a number of units on an airstrip and have at it. Or get ready to get frustrated.The mechanic of an airplane in my book is that is flies from point A to B. In HOI IV thats not the case. Here the airplanes pop up at the sector you assign them to attack for instance. German bombers are bombing the crap out of london. They are stationed in France so they have to pass through a zone called the english channel. Logic dictates that if I put interceptors up in the skies of the channel I will intercept the bombers before they reach the target right? Not in this game. In Paradoxes WWII simulator the people of the world use wormholes or warptechnology to reach the target area.And again due to a lack of any normal resource usage in the game airplanes dont consume fuel. So build 20000 planes you can let them fly for ever and ever without any problem. Never knew people in the 40's were that advanced. The same goes for ships. In HOI III at a certain point you had to stop building ships due to their constant need of fuel. Dont worry here givin enough time Belgium can build 50 carriers without breaking a sweat.4)Division creator is awesome and again the execution is shamefull and ill conceived.Why the ♥♥♥♥ do I need army experience to add or remove units from a division. Because of this you have to put your troops constantly on training in the beginning of the game to get enough exp points to create the divisions you want and need. But guess what once you start training your troops you get a nice 6 percent atrition bonus that consumes a lot of precious created equipment. I understand accidents happen during training but busting tanks and artillery without human casualties at this rate is to punitive. Like my army are a bunch of toddlers who constantly break stuff while smiling and pooping their pants. Also the organisation penalty for adding units is so harsch that you leave the creation of divisions for what it is. Its like paradox is deterring people for messing to much with division creating.My guess is that paradox knows the AI cant handle it and that by doing so we would expose the biggest flaw of this game and thats namely the AI who cant even manage the simplest of tasks.5)The economy that is non existent.In HOI III you could select a province and build stuff. Factories, Infastructure, AA etc.In HOI IV you do this for an entire region at a time and i find this lacking. It puts a brake on everything in the game. Everything is limited now. And that problem is seen best for small countries. They have few regions so they can build few factories etc. For instance Belgium and the Netherlands are small countries but in comparison with larger nations during WW II they had more factories and industrial power. Now they are limited with the regional approach of industrial buildings.Also factories in previous games used resources like electricity etc to work this was also a good soft brake for the game so that you couldnt factory spam your country to get 500 IC cause you didnt have to resources to use these factories. Now these regions become a hardbrake and its destroys the game for me. Now you have to expand military to increase your economy.The resources that are still in the game are used to produce equipment but the trade in resources in dumdeb down. The trading of money, military goods or other resources with a certain country is deleted. Now you just give up one civilian factory for resources. Again ill conceived and created to simplify the game.I can go on forever to try to convince people not to buy this game. Buy HOI III instead. The game has its flaws to but I enjoyed it more the this piece of garbage.I understand that people say wait a year or so and it will get better. I am done waiting. Im not gonna give paradox 2-3years of dlc spamming so the game might end up being good. The fundamental features of this game are broken no matter how much patches or dlc they gonne trow at it is gonna fix it.SHAME ON YOU PARADOX AND SHAME ON ME FOR BUYING THE FIELD MARSHALL EDITION.(ps: This is my first review. Normally I wouldnt spend time waisting it on a review but paradox disappointed me so hard and swindles me out of 90euros that I had to react and show that I as a consumer will not be duped ever again)

Typhoone	Recommended	110.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/explorermatt/	After two dozen restarts as nearly every faction with what felt like every strategy, I finally "finished" WWII in a historical path as the USA. A [truly] Grand Strategy game that lasts for only 12 years, with every hour as a single game turn. It feels like you can't really break the mould, but the possibility for immersion and role-play is all in the player which is status quo with Paradox titles. WWII games are a dime a dozen these days, and while some of the best or most fun focus on the first-person or squad-based combat - few embody the wide history-changing magnitude of the role the leaders of countries played during the era; Hearts of Iron has always been the Rock of the Marne in this regard.HoI IV is an evolution for the series, breaking from the complex systems and micro-management of earlier titles to open the Grand Strategy up to more casual WWII players. In my opinion this is what the series needed and Paradox looks at the core systems and the role they play: production, battle plans, division design, land/naval/air war. Several systems are half-implemented or worse have a trivial impact on game-play: trade, diplomacy, and national unity. Some systems are outright missing that would be a surefire sell to this level of gameplay: intelligence, supply, chains of command. Hopefully like many main-line PDX titles these will be addressed through a steady stream of expansions, Free-LC, and regular release of 'overhaul' patches. I appreciate the approach to what seems like an 'endless life-cycle' for their games and hope that HOI4 gets the same treatment.Since it's release, there have been patches that fixed the air war, the interface, and tuned the production systems. The AI is adequate - but low and behold I think there is no other game that has a more challenging task for an AI. Even Civilization could be a more simple AI than simulating the alternate history that titles such as Hearts of Iron allows you to explore.Hearts of Iron isn't for everyone, but if Grand Strategy or armchair-generaling is your forte, the 4th edition will be a staple in your arsenal for several years with the dedication Paradox will give it. I recommend it, and also the soundtrack is epic to boot. I recommend "Land of the Rising Sun" for your playthrough.

However,given that it is now more than two years out it is still neither optimised for modern hardware nor bug free. Also its a DLC messwhere updates and slight enhancements of the gameplay come at a stiff price unlessits occasional on sale. A couple prominent mods for this game lifting it to recommended status if youre interested in this kind of games,but the base game is imho to pricey for that.

Tonits	Not Recommended	281.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tonits/	---SUNFLOWER 1.2.1 patch---Take this review from a relatively new HOI player. The first HOI and Paradox game i played was HOI 3, back in July 2015. It was the base game without any DLC. I absolutely fell in love with it. It played it around 80 hours, just learning the mechanics of the game. 80 HOURS! Just learning the machanics! I have played HOI3 around 350-400 hours (my steam profile says 240 hours, but i have played a lot offline), and around half of that is just the base game without DLC. And when i bought every DLC to the game, it brought more mechanics to be learned! But that doesnt mean that the game was perfect. Not at all! It had a lot of problems, like the multiplayer. It was horiffic. Hard to connect, even if you had the right ports open, it would sometimes just not connect. One time i had even problems with a LAN connection... And the game would crash, a lot. In singleplayer it was pretty stable (for me atleast. My friend had a lot of problems, the game would crash every 5 min or so for him), but in multiplayer it crashed more frequently. And the AI in the base game, was horiffic. But it got a little bit better with the expansions. But it wasnt perfect.But when it comes to HOI 4, i learned the mechanics in just about 10 hours, and started to get bored after 40 hours. The AI was very dumb at the release of this game, but it has gone a little bit better in the 1.2.1 sunflower patch. When the game was released the AI made dumbass invasions all the time. The invaded with around 3 divisions, took a port and left. I didnt even try to stop them, they just left. They could have occupied my country, but no, they just took a port and left. But they have stopped with this behaviour in the 1.2.1 patch, which is good. The AI got better in patch 1.2.1, but it is far from good. And the reason i fell in love with HOI 3 was its complexity. It really felt like i was in charge of the country. And HOI 4 has complety lost that feeling. It is very far from complex, its a very arcade style of a game. When i play i feel like i have almost zero control of what is happening. I loved to play small countries in HOI 3 and see what i can do with them, when i control every single unit separately, but in HOI 4 it kind of forces you to let the awful AI control your units, even when you have very few of them. And the horrible naval invasions... Why do you have to let the AI do it. You absolutely have no control of them, except for choosing from where your units will start the invasion and invade and choosing when they start after, the AI have "planned" the invasion, and thats it. No really, you have no control of them. You cant even choose how many units land in what province. Often it goes something like this: 1. You select the units that will invade2. You select the starting port, from which they will invade and the province/provinces that you want to invade (Often you cant choose more than 2-3 provinces to invade, and they have to be next to eachother)3. You wait until the AI have "planned", takes often from 30-100 days4. Then they cant invade because they think the water are too unsecure, so you send ships to cover the curvy path that the "wise" AI has chosen, that goes through as many seazones as possible5. Then the units start the invasion and when they invade the AI has chosen which units attack which provinces, often like Province 1: 1 unit, Province 2: 1 unit, Province 3: 22 units, like wtf? What did they plan exactly?6. And then the invasion will fail or succeed, depending on the enemys defence.And when we are in the subject of battleplans, we can continue with it... Why do you force us to use a broken system? And force us to pay for a fix. I know that Paradox is a company and want to make money, but come on... I have always thought that Paradox was a pretty fair and a good company that cares about its customers, but really, 15€ for focus trees and events for some countries (that you can do probably better yourself, as you get to customize it as you like), a new autonomy system (you can find a mod for this probably) and a probably working battleplan system (that i think should be free, as it is a core feature of the game and is forced upon you to use), and a "ask for lend-lease" feature (that i think is OK, but there is probably a mod for it, if you really want it). These are all good features, but is it worth 15€? No way! You still get a free patch when the expansion comes out.But paradox made also a good move with the expansion pass. They promised 2 expansions, worth 50€, for 39.99€, but they changed it to 3 expansions for the same price, which raises its value! "Due to development limitation, we've decided to release a smaller expansion at first. As a result, the expansion pass is being extended to cover 3 expansions." A quote from Björn "BjornB" Blomberg on the official paradox forum. You can find it  here [forum.paradoxplaza.com]. This is a really nice move from them, and i have gained respect for them for doing that!The trading system is ok, but there is a minor annoyance, why cant we stockpile our resources? We can stockpile almost everything else, so why not stockpile resources?The tech tree, is kind of meh. There arent really any specialized techs, its just generic. In HOI 3 there were TONS of techs to be researched, but in HOI 4 there arent so many techs to research. I guess its enough, but in the late game (past 1945) there arent really anything to research. I guess you could mod the techtree, but as the game continues to 1948, there could be a few techs more, like industry tech for 1947, or something like that.You can leave a faction when the faction is in peace, but you cant kick a country from your own faction. Why?Espionage doesnt exist, i dont really care about it anyways, but it could be there. Doesnt matter much.There are bugs. But that is to be expected, right? No, it should not be expected to be bugs in any FINISHED game, but there still are, and there will always be. And some minor bugs arent that bad, but when you are in a faction, and a country in the same faction gets a wargoal on you, and declares war on you, something is really wrong. This happened to me, but i think its fixed now. It had something to do with the national focus tree i think.The national focus trees should be expanded, they are almost always finished quite early.And the Pro's:The game looks gorgeous! It really is beautiful!I like the new production system, its really simple and easy to use. Even though i often prefer a little more customization and depth, i think it fits in HOI 4 well.The logistics tab is AWESOME! i really like it, it brings more depth to the game, which i like. BUT why cant we stockpile our resources? Doesnt it make sense to be able to stockpile resources, when you can stockpile almost everything else?The division designer is good, as is the ship and plane upgrade system. But more options and customization would be nice.The multiplayer connectivity is really good now, but i have had some problems with the multiplayer gameplay.I cant recommend this game in its current state. But i think as time goes by the game will only get better, as it is with most, if not all, paradox titles. They often start poor, but they get better with free patches and paid expansions. I mean, if the game got worse with updates and expansions, there is something really wrong... :DI would give it a 4/10 right now. I was really hyped when it came out, but it was a huge disapointment for me, as a hardcore HOI fan. The game is definitely more arcade stylish, simplistic and casual type of a strategy game. I really dont feel like it belongs to the HOI franchise, which is a quite hardcore strategy series, and this is not really anything like that.
Nuttex	Not Recommended	1,830.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nuttex/	Abstract. If you've played previous HoI games, do not expect this to be one, certainly not in its current state. AI is braindead and has barely been improved since June. As such, there is little if any value in singleplayer. If you plan to avoid multiplayer entirely but want to have a bit more challenge than "declare war and win in one giant offensive", then don't buy this. Multiplayer is virtually the only reason to even consider getting Hearts of Iron IV at this stage.I might as well start with the pros: the old decisions have been revamped into a new tab called National Focuses that allow you to see straight away what you can do as far as scripted events are concerned, what you need to achieve in order to get them, etc. That allows you to plan your game ahead without having to do research on the forums (not recommended) or elsewhere on the Internet. Graphics are neat like in all recent Clausewitz engine games. Performance could be a bit better though, considering how the game seems to do fewer calculations in the background than Victoria 2, though I'm not entirely sure about that. The new battle plan system is nice for organising quick offences and defences, but the AI tends to be very sluggish in regards to reacts to your orders. Oh, and new orders apparently will be paid from now on, but more on that later. The new equipment system means that you end up training divisions rather than "building" them the way you would in HoI 3. They get a mix of whatever equipment they can get their hands on out of your national inventory, which will include things you produce and stuff you get from annexing countries via peace conferences. This feels like a nice change.Since the game has a different pace to it than HoI 2/3/DH, competitive multiplayer games can end in one sitting, which certainly helps to organise them. And since all recent Clausewitz games allow you to change some aesthetic files without altering your checksum, it means that you can run a lot of various life improvement mods whilst playing with people running a vanilla client in multiplayer. That's nice.Being able to send lend lease to other nations as opposed to IC like HoI 3 is also neat. With flavour mods you get to see P-51s and Spitfires being used by your Soviet pilots and this gives a nice flavour to the game overall. This also makes more sense. However, it’s still possible to provide “IC” or its HoI IV equivalent via trade.And now we get to the meat of this review: the bad stuff. Let's start with bizarre design choices. Instead of addressing the previous criticism aimed at overly complicated mechanics of HoI 3, the devs did exactly what Bioware did to RPG system in ME2 - they simply did away with it. You have your divisions that you can assign to armies (24 divisions per army if the CO is a general, infinite if it's a field marshal), and that's it. The ORBAT system is gone. Instead of streamlining it for people who couldn't be arsed to deal with it and leave it as an option for the rest, they simply dumbed it down to what we have in IV. Not only that, but it doesn't matter whether your general is command of divisions spread out across the entire globe - he will be able to control all of them equally well like an omnipotent being that he is. The old supply system has been simplified - individual provinces no longer have any infrastructure in them, only regions do. That means that as long as one tiny bit of a supply region touches another one, enemy divisions will not starve out since they will continue to get the complete access to supplies. This sometimes leads to bizarre one division rushes to cut off provinces behind enemy lines instead of going for what would’ve been their transport hubs in HoI 3. Remember how you could have supply corridors via one province wide infrastructure paths like the Trans-Siberian Railway? Not a thing anymore. In fact, advancing straight across the Sahara desert to flank those pesky Brits in El-Alamein and Tobruk are the way to go in IV. Your losses in equipment from attrition are negligible.Air and naval warfare has been dumbed, but air got off worse. Remember how air wings shouldn’t have been larger because that’d lead to debuffs caused by having too many planes in a wing that you wouldn’t be able to control all that well at once? Not a thing. If you want, you can have a 1000 fighter wing fighting it out over Benelux. Remember being able to concentrate your wings on one specific province to support an offensive even in a situation where enemy air force would otherwise be superior to yours? That’s gone, too. France consists of two air regions and that’s it. Same applies to most areas on the map. The only wings that necessitate a specific size are CAS/tactical bombers because they need to have a specific plane count to optimally participate in a land battle - think of it like combat width for divisions, except it doesn’t appear to be documented by anything in the game. Transport planes are used for one thing and one thing only - dropping your paratroopers. You can’t use them to drop supplies to cut off forces anymore. As for naval warfare, with the exception of ASW destroyer flotillas, there is no need for separate task forces anymore. Just stack up your entire navy with the exception of submarines and a few destroyers to hunt enemy subs and off you go. This is especially true in multiplayer - if you don’t do this, your opponent will and you will inevitably lose. There is a few things you can do that go beyond “select your entire navy and send them to kill the enemy navy”, but this is your lot. Supply convoys now also double as transport ships.The political system has been cut down to four parties in your country, representing fascism, communism, democracy and unaligned. The last one is impossible to boost without using a console. No longer do you need to consider what ministers to pick based on their party loyalties - none of it matters. Boosting your own parties in foreign powers is now a diplomatic action and you can’t boost your ideology in your own country with spies because, well, there are no spies.The occupation mechanics are a bit wonky at best. Remember how I said that it’s nice you can capture enemy materiel? That only applies to nations that surrendered via peace conference, i.e. the war is over. Say, you overran Czechoslovakia in a war as Germany, but they joined the Allies and the UK is at war with you. This means that you don’t get to capture any equipment in occupied Czechoslovakia at all. All of it stays in their hands even if they might not even have any land or forces left.Furthermore, there are no partisans. They’ve been spotted by some people in early development streams back in 2015, but as of now, they are not in the game. Wait for a DLC to bring them back, just like all the other missing features, mechanics and content, I suppose. Right now, the only thing that resistance does is property destruction if you have no forces occupying the land to stop them.[THE REST OF THE REVIEW IS IN THE PASTEBIN LINK SINCE IT WON'T FIT HERE - http://pastebin.com/m6Sg0JUT]TL;DR This is not a HoI game, go play Darkest Hour or HoI 3 instead. If you had no prior experience with the series, braindead AI will ensure that only multiplayer will prove to be interesting. And since missing features are all but guaranteed to be reintroduced with DLCs, prepare to whop your wad on the counter, because Johan’s sandwiches ain’t gonna buy themselves.

-J&A- Propovednik	Not Recommended	222.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067343516/	A good way to kill off a good game is to release content updates (like things that belonged in the game since the start) and then forcing players to pay for those atop the already rather expensive game. Full review later.
Def !hLcAH.RfQk	Not Recommended	81.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/goyprovat/	I speak as a veteran of the series.Is anyone else underwhelmed? I don't think it was worth the $40 price. I was expecting more. Instead we get HoI3 with better production and diplomacy systems. Land combat is the meat of the HoI franchise and yet the AI still doesn't know a strategy other than WW1-style broad front and won't bother with encirclements - and if you want to manually control your troops in order to make Guderian proud, it's way too difficult due to the UI (10+ division stacks are not divided on the map and each division you specifically want must be picked out from the army list to the left which cannot be trimmed to help you).The AI (Britain especially) also keeps doing naval invasions with pathetic 3-division forces even though its impossible for them to win. Foreign expeditionary forces that join my Japanese army take land not for my country, but for their own. It's incredibly annoying. So when India capitulates, there's a bunch of grey German province blobs surrounded by a bigger mint-green one of the Reorganized Nationalist China."Hold up, Nationalist China? Why not Japan?" you may ask. That's because of a stupid game mechanic where if you take an enemy province from an allied nation's province, the capture will go to them instead of you. I invaded Burma and beyond via my Chinese puppet's borders. Puppets are entirely not worth it because they will refuse to give you occupied territory (apparently they are concerned that it would be unfair for them for you to take "their" spoils) and because they will not give you resources. They also barely have any factories, and so will not contribute to the war effort.It is impossible to mimic real-life production (for planes, at least). The real-life Japanese could, on average, roll off 6 Zeroes from the assembly line per day, while I can only manage 2.36 with the strength of 15 factories - and can't I put in any more either, lest I sacrifice the IJA's supplies. There are also other kinds of planes which they produced in great numbers simultaneously but I am unable to do so because aircraft production appears to be underpowered.The tech tree is stupid to anyone with any knowledge of WW2 military history. For example: the level 1 battleship for Japan is the Nagato, but the level 2 battleship is the Kongo? Stupid! Everyone knows that the Nagato had guns of significantly larger caliber and armor that was very much thicker than the Kongo, which was technically called a battleship after WW1 but for all practical purposes was a battlecruiser. Also the level 2 carrier-capable naval bomber is the A6M2-N? WTF? Everybody knows at this point that the plane was a Zero with floats on, not a dedicated naval bomber.Germany is also really weak. But that's just the fault of the military AI.I also conquered Russia in 2 years as the Japanese. The fact that I even managed to do this brings the game's realism into serious question. It was too easy; most of the war was spent not fighting but gaining land. Maybe the AI just makes horrible divisions. I will have to look into this later.http://i.imgur.com/0vATiPO.pngBut the warscore system is still awfully backwards. I accounted for most Russian casualties and took the entirety of Siberia. I called in Germany later in the war to speed things up, but because most of the VP's are in European Russia, my war contribution almost immediately jumped to nil.Also, the peace conferences: the AI make stupid decisions. After the Comintern surrendered, Turkey puppeted Sinkiang and Hungary used a single tiny state to make a puppeted Russia. This tiny Russia is surrounded by the massive grey blob of the German Reich, by the way.So yes, there's my venting. 7 years of waiting and this is what we get? The only things I can say for sure that have been improved are naval and air combat. They are both very, very good now, compared to HoI3's tedious micromanagement and 100-ship doomstacks.But the rest of the game is so incredibly lacking. I should have known that it was going to be underwhelming when two devs admitted that they could not understand NATO counters. I don't know what happened to the HoI3 team, but the HoI4 team appears to be mostly greenhorns in the wargaming field, or else they would have done a lot better.
SerJosheth	Not Recommended	1,419.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SerJosheth/	*EDIT* Some people seem clearly incapable of reading this review. So I'll put my main point right up here for all those too lazy to read.GAME ISNT PROGRESSING ENOUGH FOR EACH DLC, SO SHOULD NOT ENCOURAGE BY BUYING THEM OR THE MAIN GAME. THIS IS A FUN GAME BUT HAS BUGS AND ISSUES THAT SHOULDNT STILL BE THERE. IF YOU WANT IT PICK IT UP IN A SALE. I STILL PLAY WITH FRIENDS BUT IT'S NOT WORTH FULL PRICE. Straight of the back I'd like to say I do enjoy this game, I play it an ungodly amount with friends and have really enjoyed playing it. But I cannot reccomend it unless on a substantial sale. I'm not going to lie, as someone who is a devout paradox fan and someone who continually defends the DLC policy at paradox, this review is something I never wanted to write, or saw myself having to, write. This is by far the weakest paradox game on the market for one key reason: it lacks depth. I can reccomend this game for those of you who want an arcade experience of WW2, but any grand strategy fans should think twice before buying. All wars are total, their is no diplomatic deapth and the scripting of the AI makes it ridiculously easy to outpace. Once you've played multiplayer there really is no point going back into vanilla to be honist. Singleplayer: -Game breaking bugs, most famous of which being the front line bug, where your AI generals suddenly move units off the front leaving exposed gaps for the enemy to poor into is not amusing at all and really ruins games. -The AI is horrendous, cannot think on the spot and makes singleplayer dull beyond belief when you've learnt the basics. -highly repetative, and to be honest disengaging from game to game as it goes from build stage, to early fight, to late game lag and dull grinding. Multiplayer:-This games life saver, it is a fun game to play with friends, buuuuuuut online is ridiculously unstable, and the bugs from singleplayer do make it increadibly frustraiting. Development and DLC: -the dlc offers very little at high prices -Major Nations lacking in effective focus trees-See my review of waking the tiger for more details...-Modders consistently do more  in less time, the game should not rely on modders to provide a more finished product, and by purchasing this game, in its current buggy and incomplete state, you are sending a message that this model is ok. -AI cheats, regularly spawning divisions without the factories to produce equipment to provide it, while not a huge problem when playing a major nation, this can set you at an unfair disadvantage when trying to play minors. (making the AI cheat more is not making the AI better!) To conclude, paradox can do better and it usually does. But if people keep buying it and do not review it down now, there is no incentive for the HOI team to do so.
Pretzel	Not Recommended	174.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CanadianM3rc/	The game has potential.#1 problem is poor ai. You will see germany moving armies back and forth for no reason, refusing to push in to an empty soviet capital, and not pulling troops off the russian border while at peace with them and the Allies are taking the back side of their country.I actually really like the production system in this game.  Instead of Industrial capacity like in previous games you actually build factories and set up production lines.  Then use those products to produce your units.Research is extremely simplified, plus side to this, even minor nations can keep up on tech easily, preventing their units from being completely useless. Down side is, it almost feels like you don't really have a choice in what to research. Get industry, electronics, infantry, and tanks. Research what you can in planes and water. I wouldnt recommend buying this game until the AI is fixed, no point in playing until then.
one sneaky boi	Not Recommended	159.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmeIV/	Hearts of Iron 4I've been a long time fan of Paradox. Their games cover most European and worldwide history. From Roman times in EU:Rome to modern times with the Hearts of Iron series, passing by the medieval times with Crusader Kings, the renaissance and the birth of world-spanning empires in Europa Universalis, to the industrial revolution and its social and economical consequences with the Victoria series.Entering in the Paradox fold with Europa Universalis 3: In Nomine and soon after the Divine Wind expansion. I started buying most of their games and playing them unto oblivion. Their modding policy became a haven for those with the will and wits to create enormous game-changing mods, and their constant dedication to their games with patches and expansions was refreshing, even if it generated much debate in the company's forums due to pricing policy.But this video concerns Hearts of Iron, so let me talk about my time with the series. Hearts of Iron 3 was not to my liking due to its very much in depth handling of the war and the boring and stale peace time. But I did have experience with Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game, an awesome standalone expansion for Hearts of Iron 2. It is quite an old engine with features that are very rough around the edges, but the modding scene for it saw the rise of awesome alternate history mods such as New World Order, Kaiserreich: Legacy of the Weltkrieg, and many others. These mods handled the possible outcomes of their alternate scenarios through the very moddable events and decisions, which allowed revolutions, elections, wars, and the many incurring changes in world politics that these might entail. And to get further into the point I'd like to reach in this video, I'd like to talk about Hearts of Iron 4. The newest entry to one of Paradox's most beloved franchises. I have a love/hate relationship with this game. It is very much accessible to wider audiences, something that Hearts of Iron 3 failed to deliver, but it simply lacks the defining characteristic of Paradox games: Immersion.I can guarantee you that I am easily immersed. Even Civilization games can fully immerse me into the world I'm playing, I forget that I'm playing a video game, and rather feel like a God controlling the fate of the little civilization which is represented on the maps by numbers and a bunch of 3d models, yet to me look like sprawling cities and whole armies. Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis 4 were supremely immersive games. CK2's character and trait system brought a sense of life throughout the whole world I was playing. While you're out uniting Ireland under the rule of your petty clan, the Byzantine Empire may be fighting Sunnis in the Holy Land, the petty dukes of Italy may be scheming against each other, the Reconquista brings all manner of petty wars between lords of differing faith in the Iberian Peninsula. While when I struggled to unite Italy in EU4, I knew that France and England were fighting over the control of the French mainland, that the Spanish empire colonized and conquered the new world, that Muscowy struggled to unite Russia, that the Ottomans were on their way to create their sprawling empire, that the Holy Roman Empire fought its religious wars in the struggle to keep itself united. I believe you know where I'm going with this. Even while you played in one section of the world, the rest of it was alive, there were competitors who fought for land, cultures being converted, religions being spread, empires rose and fell, technology advanced, new nations were formed. Every game felt like an adventure to the unknown, some things usually always happen, like Spain having a huge colonial empire, but what if this time it's France that's gonna get this empire? Or what if you're now competing with Spain for the juicy colonies you both now desire? All of this gave a sense of life to the game, as if countries and characters had their own objectives and ambitions, undefined by linear paths, but rather "pushed" towards it thanks to their countries' or traits' modifiers. This is what I call a "Sandbox" game, nothing is forced to take one shape or the other, it is pushed towards the shape, but events and RNG can throw this off the rails and lead to completely crazy situations. This is what I find loveable in Paradox games.Which is why I was very much hype for Hearts of Iron 4. The developers publicized it being a "Sandbox" instead of a linear game like Hearts of Iron 3. Sadly, Hearts of Iron 4's Sandbox is no Sandbox at all, it is a mere collection of linear paths that constantly clash with each other and lead to stupid and very much unlikeable situations.Hearts of Iron 4 feels dead and stale. You build buildings, you recruit armies which are inane numbers on a screen and nothing else goes on. Nothing is organic like it was in EU4 and CK2. And let me explain why:States and Provinces. Their only defining characteristic is population and buildings. No culture, no ideology. Everyone in it is equal and when you conquer it, their population will not even define your political compass at all. It's just more numbers to add up to your senseless war machine. You don't feel like you have a reason to do most what you're doing, you only do so because you need X resource or because the Focus Tree tells you to do so. Why can't I save my communist brothers trapped in that dirty fascist country? Why can't I unite an ethnic group under one banner to stand against the world together? Why doesn't a population of another culture or with another prominent ideology revolt or give me trouble? Why can't I convert a state's population to my ideology in order to give trouble to other countries conquering it?. I sometimes found a reason to fight against another country thanks to the claim system, you could claim that a state rightfully belongs to you then "core" it, which means its culture and ideology drifted towards your country's own. And I do this with much imagination, because the game provides me no reason to believe this what coring is. Nations. They have no identity, only their ideology which is a supremely abstract cheese wheel. Germany is not "German" it just has more brown in its pie chart than Blue or Red or Grey. This pie chart is only modified through propaganda from other countries and a minister who can apparently convince the whole country to believe in fascism, color me surprised, I mean -brown-. Otherwise nations are a collection of buildings and manpower, and their boundaries are strictly bound to their cores, which can only be increased through events and the like. So Germany is a collection of cores in Central Europe, nothing else to distinguish it from the rest of the world.Focus Trees. This is where the Sandbox goes out the window. The big dog nations are not sandboxy, they merely have a collection of linear paths to follow that barely take into account the world stage. So Communist Germany might go to war with Communist France over Alsace-Lorraine because of a focus, USSR would go to war with Red Germany because a focus says so. Everything that happens is bound to Focus Trees. Remove the Focus Trees and absolutely nothing would happen. Focus Trees should be what pushes a nation towards one action or the other, but NOT a strict definition of all that should happen.But enough rambling from me. I think I've thrown my point across and far beyond. HOI4 is not a sandbox, it's a collection of linear paths that clash and mash with each other with little regards to authenticity and to the way a sandbox is supposed to work.I may have blurted a whole lot of bad words about HOI4. But I do so because I believe in its potential as I've believed in the potential of all Pdox games before. It's a collection of neat ideas that need much much refining to become a fully fledged singleplayer game, worthy of entering Paradox's hall of fame.
Forehandcookie	Not Recommended	356.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Forehand/	I really want to like this game. I really do, but I can't. It's so frustrating to play because of the amount of micromanaging it takes due to the frontline AI and the bad design choices in general. I recently just gave up on my Germany game because of frustration. The frontline kept taking my troops off the frontline and creating huge patches in my frontline which is a huge issue when fighting the Soviets. Not that it really matters because fighting the Soviets as Germany is the easiest thing ever, you do absolutely nothing and wait for the Soviet AI to waste their equipment ramming into your entrenched line (That is if the AI didn't remove troops from the frontline in the first place.) Naval combat is broken, I had the pleasure of playing Romania and navally invading Brazil and losing 200k men from being sunk by the Brazilian navy despite the fact I had 30+ level 4 heavy cruisers and level 4 battleships guarding the convoys. Even though they were guarding the convoys they refused to engage enemy ships despite my navy outnumbering them and being better. There are also situations where you can lose your entire navy. Enemy ships will engage your navy, then those ships retreat and then they re-engage your navy immediately after, while enemy planes slightly damage your ships. This results in a loop which is extremely difficult to escape and almost always results in your navy being destroyed. The meta is to just spam battleships and carriers, subs and destroyers are basically useless. Defeating the Allies as the Axis is beyond difficult, that is if the US joins the Allies. You have to invade through Canada or South America while dealing with their airforce and navy and when you do land you have to deal with 500+ divisions as well as the attriction. Doing this all before 1948 when the game becomes extremely laggy and nearly unplayable is near impossible. The AI does pointless naval invasions (in my last game as Germany, Greece navally invaded Greenland and failed to capture the port.) The AI also only spams out infantry divisions and fail to produce any tank divisions. It really is such a good concept of a game that is ruined by poor AI and greedy devs who disguise DLC's as patchs (can't wait for them to "fix" naval combat in Man the Guns.)

snortdog	Not Recommended	785.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/imbased/	Hearts of Iron 4 is a game that has some good things about it but innumerable amounts of problems and bad things. When playing the game I feel like I'm playing as if it's in early access; it's unimaginable to think what the game would have looked like when it was being delayed. I'll start this off saying what I liked about the game.+The freedom of choice and 'what if' scenarios really do make this stand out from the other hearts of iron games; what if germany became communist instead of fascist, or what if it became democratic? You can simulate that with the ministers, and it's quite fascinating.+Units are also manageable, and can be manually controlled unlike in hearts of iron 3 where manual control as almost impossible as countries like the USSR because there are just way too many units.  There are also battle plans which are nice but there are some aspects I don't like about it, more on that later. +Great soundtrack, as to expect with most paradox games. Too bad they shamelessly reused some eastVSwest music.-+National focus is a pretty good idea, however it would be nice if you were able to make some manual decisions like in previous games other than being locked into doing them whenever the focus ends. There are also lots of countries that have a default national focus, and the fascism tree is quite overpowered, but I'm sure that will be fixed.+Multiplayer system is great, Production menu (not construction menu) is quite neat and tidy, minors are more playable, and naval battles are quite nice as well as you are no longer limited to creating seperate special fleets and can be more creative. I am increasingly running out of nice things to say about this game so it's time to move to the negative.-I should first off say what everyone else is complaining about; the AI, it's completely clueless on what to do at almost every moment. When world war 2 starts, the ai will likely send all of its troops to africa or somewhere else equally as useless, because it probably doesn't know what is strategic and what isn't, so it just distributes units everywhere. German AI if it has trouble will still DOW countries at a fixed rate, so if they have a front with france and denmark it will still decide to also war the soviet union in 6 months. Encircling AI is also incredibly easy as it just stands there and lets itself become slowly encircled and eventually killed because it's too dumb to move back. I've managed to invade the UK as ireland with paratroopers because the AI is so incompetent and killed all their units in a useless naval invasion against germany, it's indeed quite pathetic.-Games are likely to be over before the 1941 mark; wasting all of the techs that you could have had in 1945. I think it's because most people get bored waiting for outbreak to war so they just start it right off the bat, it doesn't help that fascist governments can war the instant the game starts, It's a huge shame since most of the early techs are quite bland.-Peace conferences and making peace in general are terrible; no longer can you make white peaces with other countries now, instead you can only make a peace treaty under very specific circumstances. When you do make that peace expect a minigame of 'trying to pick as much territory before the other person does' because everyone tries to nick every little piece of territory a country has, even if they did nothing in the war! Peace treaties are also tied to world tension in being if you take territory that is more than what you asked for, world tension will rise, but why would anyone care if world tension rised? More on world tension later.-Some things in the game are completely broken. Coups are just silly; as germany can just do a coup on france and make the whole marginot line fall to fascists, to things like adding artillery to your divisions in division designer making them unkillable, and being able to make forts that give over -100% battle efficiency in less than a year if you have the factories, making france almost unkillable. Why?-This also brings me to the point on how weak the axis is in this game. Because of how the system works, USA can join the war very early on, and along with the super overpowered forts makes france unraidable... unless you do something really gamey like drop paratroopers in 3 of frances highest victory point places and instantly make them capitulate; forgot to mention that you can do that too.-People say they like the construction alot; but being an old hearts of iron player I think it's godawful. It's good in the early years, but later on you can be building up to 15 factories at a time; if there was a mod that was set in modern day would people be building over 100 civilian factories at a time? Something tells me I don't think so.-While on the topic of simplicity; this game really is the simplist of all hearts of iron games. It's not neccesarily bad that paradox is trying to get new people to try the game, but that's where the learning process comes in hand, and instead paradox decided to cater to the casuals and ditch the old community. Things like dissent and money and espionage, all the things that made the previous hearts of iron games fun and dynamic are gone. Partisans are more of a nuisance than an actual problem, battle plans literally give lazy players an advantage simply for using them, and armies are now managed into either generals or field marshals. Generals can be assigned 24 units and field marshals unlimited units; something tells me thats not how simple the OOB is in real life...-Historical accuracy is also unreal; why does the Peoples Republic of China have a flag that wasn't established until 1949? Why is america allowed to join the war in 1939? Why is Iraq and Yemen/Oman not a puppet of the british? Where the hell is Manchukuo, and if you didn't want them in the game then why add the even more pointless nation Mengkukuo? How the ♥♥♥♥ do you mess that up?-And since I mentioned world tension earlier; I should explain how ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is too. It's basically a thing that goes higher and higher when people declare war against eachother or do belligerent acts (germany doing rhineland). Problem is in multiplayer games people all declare war against eachother immediately since fascist governments can make war goals the instant the game start(how realistic), and this makes the USA able to enter the war very early into the game. Problem is even if you as germany don't make world tension, what's saying something like the soviet union isn't going to DOW the whole asian continent? The whole system is ♥♥♥♥ed; and needs major reworking.Overall as I just said, the game needs maajor reworking if it wants to be anything like other paradox games. For now I would stay away; but keep a close eye as paradox will probably come back from their summer break and start fixing some problems that plague this game, and then maybe I can change my mind on how I feel about the game.

treating women like pets	Not Recommended	414.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aaronholloway/	As much as I enjoy this game, there is nothing that can stop me from recognising how utterly♥♥♥♥♥♥it is. At every available opportunity, the developers will attempt to screw you over for a little extra money to fill their pockets.You can expect from this game:--- A stunning, and aggressive lack of content. With the exception of a couple of favourites, nearly every country is lacking flavour text to make it at all interesting or different in experience.--- Unrealistic gameplay. Due to balancing, an awful tech tree, and typically overpowered and samey national focus trees, the game does not play like a historical simulation to any concievable degree, despite what it claims to be. As opposed to a grand strategy game, it feels more like a "WWII themed sandbox."--- Boring gameplay. For years of the game, there will be nothing to do except hit alt+tab and have fun while you wait for the game to become fun. If you're not at war, it is boring, and even when at war, it feels boring and tedious after you figure out the God-awful AI's favourite strategies and how to easily counter them. At the hardest difficulty, which actively boosts AI performance and degrades your own through modifiers on production, research, and army organisation, the AI still makes decisions that rookie players could find fault with.--- Simple mechanics. There is not in-depth and hardcore design to the game found in other, older Paradox titles such as Victoria II, or even the constantly updated EUIV. These games require experience to play, and have a learning curve that allows the player to start every new game with more and more skill. HOI4 does not. It is simple, easy to figure out and does not change.--- An active modding community. One of the only good things about this game is its modding community, which has made many features and developments that make the game, which has been developed by a studio specifically catred to grand strategy games, look in comparison bland and boring. Look at Kaiserreich for example, whose gameplay FAR outmatches the base game.--- DLC whoring. Expect the game to feel absolutely garbage for years to come. While Stellaris has far superceded this game in terms of content and playability, HOI4 still drags its feet through the special kid's special sandbox. It's actually awfully unfun.Fix your ♥♥♥♥ing game Johan, you slimy piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥

tradford1	Not Recommended	2,442.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035542917/	Have owned every version of Hearts of Iron.  After the latest patch to Cornflakes I would say that the game is in the worst shape it has ever been in.  Single player is almost impossible to play at any level.  In trying to make all sides even in all areas for mulitplayer Paradox seems to have broken it for everyone.   Going to need some big fixes or to have some stuff reversed out.  Balance is now horrible.  It is almost impossible for the Allies to complete with Germany and Japan.   Paradox is focused on the large markets in Asia so they have thrown away REAL history and created a fantasy game.   At this poing with almost 3000 hours of play on Steam I am going to retire from Hearts of Iron for awhile.

Phaeron	Not Recommended	984.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cavdargiray/	Few months ago i have given this game around 8-9 points this was due to its very high potential and its enormous base content despite some obvious  content which is needed. However after few months and 4 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ patches and a painfully funny and desperate dlc i have concluded that Paradox aint gonna develop this wonderful game despite having a relatively solid base game and the greates theme ever (ww2) . What game needs most is a better ai . Because i  a regular playthrough you can pretty much do everything you want because ai doesnt have a clue what to do . Do you want to conquer entire world as ,lets say, Czechoslovakia despite having a bloodthirsty neighbour ? Go on !There is not a thing to hold you as long as you have the basic knowledge about the game because ai is that bad (just watch isorrowproductions on youtube if you dont believe me ) .In a regular playthrough you can see Greece joining the chinese united front ,instead of allies, when it is attacked by Italy .Because on paper both CUF and Allies fight aganist Axis  and to the greece this is all that matters. Most of the countries lack National ideas and some really needed events . For example one of the European powers that had been in the middle of the war,Finland, doesnt have its own National focus tree for some holy reason .But wait this is the funny part ;Paradox actually  released a dlc for commonwealth nations which added national  focuses and they actually charged people for this !When you charge people for stuff you should have included in the main game that means how far has your company fallen since Hoi3 which had an acceptable ai , Leader portraits and HISTORICAL EVENTS.  Historical events... Besides some Olympiad events there is almost none . And as far as i know there is only one event that affects the actual game and that is about a lady named Amelia Earhart ,al lady  who joins the USAF after travelling the world. Yet there are no events about Province of Hatay Joining Turkey , Romanian coup towards the end of WW2 (and i also want to point out that some of the mods out there ,such as Millenium dawn , that have more  depth than the actual game .I can go on for hours about this game and its needs but i think you people get what i mean . I love this game  and that is why i gave it a thumbs up upon its release but the current product is something really far from what i have expected while buying . Thanks for reading . I hopr you have a nice day . Bye
Knifons	Not Recommended	387.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/24e_Sgt_Reaction/	As much as I love this game I cant recommend this game to anyone who excpects to buy a good ww2 strategy game and get what they want. Because, its a strategy game but its becoming less and less about ww2 and more about, wierd random ****.My main concern with this game isn't the incredibly dumb AI, thats still hasn't been fixed after 2 years. Not with Paradox's blatant cash grab DLC policy, where they lock core features behind a paywall (Blitz button on battle planner) Not the, unecessary addition of alt-history content which we didn't ask for, or even the fact that they haven't fixed teleporting ****ing airplanes . My main concern with the game, is that Paradox has pretty much forgoten about its core audience who want a good ww2 strategy. Where we can play as Germany, and have a somewhat plausible ending where I don't have to kill off every damn country that is in the Allies before they surrender, or play as the Soviets and have a Germany that will actually put up a fight, and wont let me just steamroll across itself. I know that Paradox has somewhat fixed these issues, but again you're not really going to see these issues fixed unless you buy their DLC's. Oh and don't tell me about the free patch, Paradox has clearly stated that if we are to stop buying the DLC's they will probably stop developing the game all together. So in other words if you excpect the "free" patch to come around, you actually have to buy the DLC's, or paradox will just stop fixing the game. You see, Paradox has taken the same path as it did with CK II and EU IV in that they'll just add more and more DLC's. However none of them are addressing the issues, nor are they bringing anything new to the table. What they're doing is readding mechanics from their older titles, and adding these alt-history paths so that youtubers like ISorrowProductions and Drew Durnil can make more vids about HOI 4 memes. Because they generated a lot of interest towards the game and as such created a wider audience that has bought HOI IV. (Don't get me wrong, I love those vids as much as the next guy here, but I digress)As such, Paradox is now focused on creating more of these weird, unplausible, alt history content, so that the more people will notice the game and generate more revenue. The game is now being developed toward a casual audience, that will want to witness funny stuff and randomness happen in their games. And that's fine, but that's NOT WHAT THE GAME WAS INITIALLY MEANT TO BE. It will most likey be a very long time, and will cost well over 100 dollars worth of DLC just to experience the game that we old fans really wanted to see since day 1.I'm sorry Paradox but this is just sad and I can't support your decision here. I understand that you're a company and that you're supposed to make money, but you should have at least followed through on your first promise and deliverd a ww2 that we were actually promised. We wanted a HOI that, had more features but with a better UI. Not LESS features, and streamlined gameplay. It's clear that you guys are not going to change anything. I won't buy any more of your titles until you will follow through, and deliver the game that was initially promised to us. How can I buy any more of your games if you charge us for the access to the game, and then keep charging us more and more to access in game features, some of which should have been part of the main game anyways? 
Coyote	Not Recommended	200.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zoev/	This is a fairly tough review to write, but I feel as though it needs to be written. I do not recommend Hoi4. It just doesn't have anywhere near the depth of Paradox's CK2. Hoi4's pace is frantic and constantly grinding forward, I would rate this as a high stress game; which is perfectly fine. But as far as high stress games go, there is very little reward and far too much frustration with the AI/Mechanics.The frontline mechanic, while pretty awesome in concept, has been bug-ridden since release. It's gotten so bad that your armies with sometimes just abandon entire sections of the front. This mechanic, while technically optional, is needed to gain experience. While Hoi4 has many, many other frustrating bugs and issues like this, I want to state that the frontline is by far the worst and can be absolutely game breaking.Again, the depth of the game is no where near other paradox titles. Gameplay is entirely focused around war, and making things to fight war. Focuses and research only aid these actions. There are no diplomatic or espionage solutions to be found. As gameplay is highly scripted, Hoi4 becomes a repetititve grind very quickly. It plays more like LoL and other such games than a true sandbox grand strategy title.While the modding community is vast and constantly pushing the boundaries of the engine, the community as a whole is pretty terrible. A quick browse at the steam workshop will show that many of the top mods simply add nazi symbols into the game, which players post for "historical-authenticity"; yeah right.Hoi4 is a grindy grand strategy title, lacking depth of gameplay, filled with constantly changing frustrating bugs and festers in a growing community of wheraboos and nazis. Not my cup of tea.

WTF is going on with my all time favourite game creators. Please find your way back to the right  path!UPDATE 5-6-2017WE ARE 7 MONTHS FURTHER AND STILL NO PATCH TO GET THE AI TO WORK. THEY ARE RELEASING DLC's THOUGH!UPDATE 24-3-2018FIX the damned AIThe reviewEverybody should judge for themselves whether this game is good or not. I think it is a good game on many fronts, but I don't recommend it. I don't recommend it because I love the old HOI and the whole EU & CK games in which you have to micromanage a lot and there is a steep learning curve. HOI 3 was a bit disappointing for me because of the AI and the theaters. Instead of a step forward from HOI2 it felt as diffrent game. Not better or worse. Just different. HOI 4 feels like a simplefied HOI 3 with a less steeper learningcurve and a very bad AI. Nevertheless the game looks great and I could learn to love it if they would fix the AI. I'm not much of a multitplayer guy and IMO it sucks that singleplayer gamers like me, who started playing paradox games as early as 2000 are faced with a game that is mostly developed for muliplayers. There are people making mods to fix issues (thanks for that) but I believe Paradox Interactive should have have released the game with a good AI. I watched the broadcasts on twitch in which the multiplayer game was played bij Johan. Never ever did I have the idea that the AI was broken and not able to make sound choices. I bought the game on release to find out I can't enjoy it because of the bad IA.Still there is no announcement that they are fixing it and when the will release a patch. The haven't acknowleged the fact. The do release the first dlc! So for now I don't recommend it.
Professor Death	Recommended	138.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/professordeath25/	If you are a (wannabe) (closet) Fascist, Communist, Imperialist, (insert your country) Nationalist, (insert your group) Supremacist, Liberal, Conservative, Democrat, Socialist, etc. etc. etc. and unhappy with how the World Wars ended, then this is the game for you.The trick is to focus on war preparation, rather than the war.
Auriga	Not Recommended	597.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSecularPoptart/	The vanilla game is a barebones experience to lure you in to buy the DLC.It worked for me and works for many, the base game gets boring after a couple playthroughs. The only reason I have 400 hours is cause of mods and DLC, and mods were the overwhelming majority of these hours. I dont regret the hours I put into this game, but I do regret the money I gave to a company who put what seems to be minimal effort into this title. The horrid DLC is one thing, but theres also the many gameplay issues that annoy the heck (gotta be family friendly) outta me. The AI is broken, Germany will blindly declare war when they havent finished another (like declaring war on Denmark and Norway when the allies are at the gates of Berlin.) The AI completely neglects its shorelines and cities so you can easily take over a nation in weeks with paratroopers and naval invasions, especially Italy and France. Nations will completely abandon their frontlines as you roll across their country and they do nothing to stop you. The representation of troops leads to the late game being an absolute mess and the game generally just runs bad.The game at its base is not worth the $40 they want you to shell out, and the half-decent experience isnt worth the cost of all the DLC. Id only recommend this to people who really like strategy and have alot of cash to spare and want to support these horrid DLC policies
Vinceremos	Not Recommended	1,453.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198250038236/	IMO this game is good but not good enough. My biggest hate for this product is how easy it is. The only thing that will be "hard" will be doing world conquests, and it isnt even that hard. My other issue is how DLC whory it is turning, legit most of the DLC content can be gotten threw mods. If you want a challange get the Black Ice mod. In short if you want the game wait for it to be $20 or buy Hoi: Darkest Hour and enjoy WW1 start, WW2, the fall of germany start and a 1904 Russo-Japanese war scenerio. P.S Dony buy the DLCs dont suport Paradox money whoring schemes.

I have played HOI 3 for hundreds of hours probably, usually with mods, but the mods are based on the core game which is pretty good.  In its current state this game is unplayable.  I can only think that all the people that have given positive reviews have been playing Risk, and not played a full game of HOI 4 before putting in their reviews. So many of the same points being said that I am not going to list them all....ok, maybe a few in no particular order Bad....-No mini map-AI sucks....and that is not the opponent AI, the "Allied" AI does more to ♥♥♥♥ you than the enemy does.-pretty map, for hanging in a 3rd grade classroom and talking about the countries of the world....sucks for military actions-Generals and the OOB...I figured out how the Chinese had a level 7 leader....all...ALL 200 divisions in China were under his leadership and were passing him experience.-Resources should be stockpiled, duh, if I dig up 100 million tons of aluminum a month but only use 80 to build aircraft I will just dump the rest into the sea or something because, hell, I will never need it, but that extra steel I have that is being traded to my next enemy....sorry cant stop that either.  yes I know he gives me civ factories in exchange...but would like to make that choice myself.oi...I am done....just read all the other responses about how this game needs fixed badly

BuyableGuitar6	Not Recommended	551.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/buyableguitar6/	As of this review I have 252.6 hours recorded, and more played offline. *Alert, Wall of text incoming*   How can I start... this game is great fun for the first 1oo hours, playing as a country pre-WWII... all the way up to the end of the war, and even exceeding 1945... amazing... Apart from the major flaws, inconsistancies, bugs and total braindead AI. First, you have the tutorial, its... ok, but doesnt really help you learn the game at all. Personally I learnt by messing around in-game and watching youtube videos, and I passed on that knowledge to my friends who play the game. But this doesnt really matter, after all, tutorials arn't always helpfull and at least this one isn't compulsory. Next I'll adress the gameplay, and imbalancing of the countries, combat and units. Review starts nowThe only way to play this game successfully is to declare war ASAP to gain land, rescourses and factorys for your growing country, and the best way of doing this is to kill france beore the close of 1937 an any country in europe... including Poland, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Britain, Spain, Gerany, Switzerland, and if you really want to push it... Ireland. Of course this takes some political manouvering and is part of the game, is it not? Well... yes. But If I play on historical mode I don't want Italy killing Germany after joining the comnitern, Germany not being able to kill poland (Lie, it took them from 1939 to 1944, but by then they are mostly dead) and I have even witnessed france hold off Germany and acctually kill them without joining the Allies (as Britain said no to them even after completing their political focus). So "Historical Mode"... not so much. But if you want to play a whacky free for all, turn that "Historical AI focuses" off (or keep it on and see how innaccurate the game is... up to you) Additionally, country specific 'focus trees' are usally worse than the defualt tree thay gave to all the countries which they didnt 'do up' before release so that they could charge money to allow you to play some of the key countries in the game's set time period (or so I have found), and I will reitterate that... THEY CHARGE FOR REVAMPS OF KEY COUNTRIES !!! This wouldn't be soo bad, apart from the fact that the defults are better, and the fact that the specific ones tie you to a certain path (Britain's commonwealth pathway always boosts democracy... even if you are communtist or fascist). However much the charging of base game content does annoy me it IS NOT why I am not reccomending this game, I'm just stating it. In addition to this, certain units *Paratrooper* are completely overpowered, and allow you to take over countries with ease and minimal effort, aswell as minimising casulties. Sounds great? Take over Britain, France, USA, USSR, Canada, China, Japan, and Italy all before 1943 as Germany, whilst using paratroopers and you will get bored... very quickly. But not only does this game mess up; country balancing, units and history, it also messes up the actual combat mechanics. For example, if you asslut 9000 troops with... say 90000 troops, you should win... no? Well tell that to the developers who think that those special 9000 can hold of the horde armed with bolt actions just because they are standing still, on a beach, or in some forts... mountains make sense... sort of. Say goodbye to USSR mass assults when you have those special warriors who are outnumbered 20 to 1 in forts! This game is the eppitimy of "the best defense is a good offense", and punishes you for assulting... 99% of the time. Unless you have tanks, then it a whole different barrell of fish. (unless you are assulting a city then say goodbye to your good 'soft attack' value) I understand the defence holding off more people thing, but that only works to a certain degree, not in a 20 to 1 ratio when everyone has the same weapons. Also, the AI doesn't seem to understand this, deciding to waste their 1M manpower on your'e only land border by chucking them at you. Last but not least you have game inconsistancies. What I mean by this is you can play the game through with spain going into civil war in 1936/7, germany killing poland in 1939, etc... then you can try to change ideology... one playthrough, you can chance before 1937, with no civil war, then you restart, play the same country, do the same thing, then you can not change till 1939, and have a civil war, lose all your navy, most of your devisions, and have to lose manpower killing the other ideology who takes more of the military than you, even if your'e the ideology major in the country pre-civil war. Whats more is the way you can win them... delete all your'e military pre-war and recruit after its started and walk into their capital with 10%/20% trained troops... great war guys. (unless your'e spain where troops appear out of nowhere when the war starts)   Overall, the game is good... if you can bear the bugs and major flaws, want to play a somewhat accurate WW" simulator, have time on your hands, or have people to play it with. Otherwise I would avoid the game untill the developers find their finger and put it to use coding a better AI for the game.
GShock	Not Recommended	2,108.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197980852821/	At present time, with patch 1.1 and 3 months after the release the game is totally broken due to a hasty launch, followed by the Holiday. Aside from the AI being broken, the production levels are a complete joke. Some core concepts such as fuel/ammo/food are missing and so is the currency. Many concepts are over simplified and do not handle the complexity of war too well. I am sure this is going to be a great game in 2018 and I recommend buying it then at a much lowered price than what I paid for it but right now I don't recommend buying it.
owman1	Not Recommended	34.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198020166560/	As someone who plays a lot of Paradox games and holds them in quite high esteem I find myself not really liking HOI IV. Despite the pretty steep learning curve the game quickly becomes repetative and the warscore system is completely indecipherable - nations only tangentally involved with your conflict can claim territory on the other side of the world because of how the game lumps all conflicts together larger wars and hours of progress can be obliterated pretty swiftly. The AI is poor as well, often sending large armies to starve, freeze, or dehydrate in the siberian wilderness or sahara desert. The friendly AI is guilty of this as well, so it's better to micromanage your army instead of giving it to the computer. Despite the huge number of nations, they all play pretty similarly and games can turn into huge grinding slogs where no progress is made for hours, and air power is usually an ancilliary element at best. However, HOI isn't awful, and there is some fun to be had recreating the war or forging your own alternate histories, but it is much shallower than advertised and paradox has taken to releasing fixes in paid DLC, which is pretty low even for them. If your really interested in the second world war then there are probably worse ways to spend your money, but i'd recommend Stellaris or Crusader Kings 2 over HOI, both are (to me at least) more repeatable and interesting games.
Dipex	Recommended	397.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dipex/	I wish there was an "eh" button for the review, because I feel like HoI4 falls into that category.  I can't really pinpoint why I feel that way about the game either, its substantially better than Stellaris (ie its actually a game and everything actually works as intended).  But at the same time its not on par with HoI2.  I think the reason for that is that what takes away from this game is a litany of small annoyances - dozens of tiny things that could have just been done slightly better - rather than a single glaring problem.For example, the UI makes everything just slightly too inconvenient to do.  Its slightly too annoying to move planes up with your troops, and if you're fighting on the border of one of the predefined air zones there isn't really a good way to divide up your planes between them.  The land theater UI is also just a little too annoying to use - there really needs to be just a general "advance foward" command or a way for it to dynamically assign divisions to a front based on current needs.  The current system becomes a problem when you're rapidly advancing into an area with borders from multiple countries, or terrain features like lakes.  Everytime your front reaches one of those it splits into two new fronts, which divides your units up based on whichever front they're closer to, rather than whichever front needs them the most.  This requires you to do a tremendous amount of tedious and unnecessary micromanaging to resolve something that shouldn't even be an issue in the first place (ie a lake or new border shouldn't split the front).Submarines are also annoying to fight against.  Once you clear out a country's main navy you tend to just get bogged down dealing with submarines because they start combat unattackable.  They can only be attacked once they decide to engage, but they won't engage against unfavorable odds.  This results in your fleets just becoming stuck in a permanent, unending combat against them, which lasts until their country surrenders because they don't need to remain in supply to just sit in a zone and continually force your ships to just sit there waiting for them to surface.  Again, this isn't game breaking, but its annoying.And that really sums up a lot about the game.  It has a lot of good points, and a lot of things that seem like they could be fun.  But when you get into it everything is just slightly too inconveniant for you to think "man this is really a worthy successor to HoI2."I ultimately came down on the thumbs up side for this because despite its flaws its still a decent game, and with Stellaris and MoO being the turds that they are its really the best thing on the market right now.  Given that, if you're itching to play a grand strategy game, its worth your $40.  If you just saw a post about the game on a site somewhere and are looking to jump on the hype train without any real interest in the genre then its probably not worth your money.
Jador	Recommended	997.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028276100/	Disclaimer: I have 819 hours in as of writing, but I often play until 2am and walk away without closing it - actual play time is probably closer to ~550 hours.  That's still a lot but take it with a grain of salt vs. what Steam reports.I love this game, but it lets me down, specifically wrt the mechanics of sending troops over water during wartime.  3,000 aircraft, a thousand ships, total domination, is still not enough for 5 dudes to traverse the 33km between England and France, and therefore everybody gets slaughtered and the Nazis win.  Similar "wtf my super army just wiped" moments during key gameplay occur throughout - and you'll plan and build for hours to get to those key moments.If you use the earlier starting period then you spend a few years strategically building up your capability, based on knowledge gained through previous gameplay, and when the game reacts stupidly then it really does feel like hours, or 10-20 hours, of wasted time.  OTOH, if you save tactically (protip: do so), you can revert to snapshot and adjust inline vs. starting over or quitting in frustration.Definitely recommend HOI4 - some of the best money I've spent on Steam - but geez, really guys?  If mechanics are going to be nuanced then that's fine, but they need to be apparent and any inbalance clearly presented.Despite any frustration, I'd buy it again in a heartbeat - and I order any DLC the moment it's available.  If you want a greater guarantee of satisfaction then get a simpler game; this one will challenge you, you'll replay the same starting conditions over to understand the full implications, and it's awesome, even if it p!#$'s me off. :-)

ocean pollen	Recommended	33.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/oceanpollen/	I bought HOI3...and then never played it.  I tried several times.  I watched videos.  I played other games.I bought HOI4...and played it for three hours straight, as much as I had time for.  Actual playing, not just staring hopelessly at the screen.  I had to do the Italy tutorial twice when I flubbed grand planning; after that, I went Austria, turned it Fascist, joined the Axis, and prepared to wage war on Czechslovakia.  My win condition is: don't get annexed by Germany.  I'm winning so far!HOI 4 is a grand strategy game that you can actually play.  So play it.EDIT: and then I got annexed by Germany.  But I held out for 262 days.EDIT @ hour 25: I played my first multiplayer game.  Mostly speed 3.  As Poland, I took advantage of Germany's overcommittment in other wars and then I took Berlin, and joined the allies in a bitter slugfest in southern Europe.  I started with an western and an eastern army, which turned into a Assault Germany army and a Keep Czechslovakia at Bay army, which turned into a two-front invasion of Czechslovakia while a six-divison break away army mopped up Denmark.This game has some weaknesses, yes.  The complaints are crazy hyperbolically expressed IMO but still frequently true.  But I've gotten used to the planning system and had great fun in this MP game, only microing to take advantage of weak spots or to crush pockets of enemies.  I was able to manage three different armies in three different locations reasonably well without pausing the game.Summary:1. Paradox absolutely nailed making the game more approachable and playable.  That was their aim, and they succeeded.  Well done!2. The game is fun.  If you start to get unhappy with SP, try MP -- it's a blast.3. I feel like the SP replayability of non-great powers is pretty limited at the moment.  You're always diving down the industry tree of the same generic focus tree.  After playing a bunch of SP games as minor powers, I think from now on I'll just play great powers except in MP.

They don't attack when they should and they do suicide attack when they should not. Really easy to surround them.

The Yellow King	Not Recommended	367.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030491729/	So with the latest patch I felt like this needed a review, and unfortunately it is negative.The game overall feels overly simplified and has some questionable mechanical choices, such as the front line system, while a cool idea, it the AI is unable to handle it properly and will move troops around forfitting foritifaction bonuses that can lead to the front colapseing, the lack of ability to control this short of manualy moving everything and forfitting planning bonuses seems like a pretty big problem.Also the game feels far to stuck in history, too many of the National Focus trees focus on following history without much deviation, and the deviation there is feels rather off and with some nations will even cut you off from other important national focuses.And lastly, my biggest issue with this game is that they stuck the Spearhead option as part of the DLC instead of being part of the base game, I understand the dlc should have some meat to back it up but something like that is actualy important mechanicaly to the game and should have been part of the patch, not a paid for dlc.

Wilfred Laurier	Recommended	1,667.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wilfyofprojectwilson/	Great game, sadly the community is filled with "entitled" trash who think everything should be free because they forget people spend time making these games, but the game is great, the AI needs work but all in all the game is nice, I enjoy it and know many who do. I highly recommend you buy it if you are looking for a good WW2 simulator, plus if you like Alternate history there is quite a few good alternate history mods which completely overhaul the game. We also can't forget the wonderfull historical overhauls for the Modern Day and WW1 :) and soon The Cold War. For real though, buy it if you have interest in games like these and WW2 or the other things I mentioned.

It would look like this:(Games from Steam but also having copies from Paradox, Matrix, and Gamersgate)(All played more than 200+ hours, some more than 1000+/2000+ hours...)(HoI3, Panzer Corps (Panzer General), EU3 even more than 5000+ hours)Complexity definition to create this rating is as follows:Number of different concepts/rules to learnInterrelation between different game concepts/rulesNumber of options to choose from (type of different weapons, technologies, diplomacy, economy, production, etc...)COMPLEXITYComplexityGame100 World in Flames (Australian Design Group - Computer version, No AI)80 Hearts of Iron Black ICE65 SuperPower 260 Hearts of Iron 350 Hearts of Iron 445 Europa Universalis 340 Total War Series35 Gary Grigsby's World at War: A World Divided15 Star Wars: Rebellion10 Panzer Corps2Commander: Europe at War1 RiskI have been waiting for HoI4 for two years, and it has been a disappointment... Why? I love HoI series, and I like HoI4 but less than expected. I was hoping an evolution of HoI3, a more advanced HoI3 with improvements and nice and friendly GUI. More elaborated in aspects like diplomacy, commerce, espionage, etc. What I have received it's more a RTS game not as deep and inmersive than HoI3. More oriented to players who like nice graphics and fast playing. In HoI3 you can feel like being really in charge of a nation in almost all the aspects of the game. HoI4 is clearly much more casual (capped). To me, the main difference between a wargamer player and a RTS player it's playing speed. A wargamer will stop to think and elaborate plans much more than a RTS player more oriented to produce and storm lots of troops against enemies. HoI series was unique for wargamers, now it has lost some of the magic that made it so special.Points changed:Strategic/Tactic Info available: worse than HoI3 (capped)Visual display/control of units on map: worse than HoI3 (capped)Creation/Rearrangment of units: Worse than HoI3 (capped)Overall economic system: Worse than HoI3 (capped)Overall political system: Worse than HoI3 (capped)Overall diplomacy system: worse than HoI3 (capped)Overall espionage system: No espionage (removed)Battle plans: Good try if it could work much betterMusic: NiceCounters: Yes, there are basic NATO counters... but not as I was hoping (HoI3 was perfect). You should be able to perceive visually if a unit is a battalion, regiment, brigade, division, corps, army, army group... Also you should be able to attach/detach units from battalion to army groups like HoI3 and change their assignment to another division i.e., also no commanders for minor entities like corps...Map: Nice but more simple than HoI3, lack of visible province names(Also note distractions on map with lots of things moving and disturbing.)Etc...For hardcore wargamers it's as a break after playing more complex games. If you are tired of complexity and you want some relaxation you can try HoI4 for a certain time.Achievements are a good adding that encourage to try new possibilites and select countries that you never would choose.FINAL NOTE:it's NOT the same as HoI series was, but not entirely a bad game. I enjoyed watching aberrations around the entire map like watching a fantasy movie, I even let thet game to play alone while I'm in passive mode, I laugh a lot but finally boredom and a certain degree of disappointment with Paradox.  There are a lot of bugs, even when Paradox used to work hard in the past to solve as many of them, this time they decided to go to vacation after launch letting alone the players with a bugged game. (Sorry, broken english)

Troop leaving borders undefended because of the new ai army system would leave one , one single province open and it will destroy everything and ruin your game. The Fallback line doesn't work half the time neither.Ai countries going mad and declaring war against multiples other countries while being destroyed.The new field Marshall system is buggy, smart idea but doesn't work.A few decisions and uprising are broken, exemple: does revolution in China as communist China, spend 240 days doing so and only get 1-3 elite troops.I really love this game and it a shame it just a buggy Freaking mess AT THE MOMENT. the older version are better than the new one and I hope they change it else it be a shame to see this game burn in a mess of bug and unplayability.I'll change review when it fixed but I suggest you pass on this game in the current state it is.

mi.an.molnar - Stake.com	Not Recommended	243.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127891743/	Well, yes and no.As HOI3 was too difficult to manage, this is too simple to be a Paradox game.The core gameplay is fun, it is not as dumbed down as a mobile WWII game, but I have to agree with the criticism. There has to be a way to make a game both accessible and not dumb and too easy. Instead of making some clever design work, they ripped the complex aspects out of it. As I remember HOI and HOI2, they had also really dumb AI, but it would b nice to not have them now. The trade system is for me unnecessary constraining, the research tree is dumbed down. I really enjoy the game, but just to voice support for the opinion, that it was simplified too much. I think, they have a false image of the audience they are targeting. People who will buy a WWII game are those, who know that Czechoslovakia had land forts on the whole border, tank divisions, what the Battle of Midway was, that various equipment was not introduced in the year the game states and things like that. The audience like that does not need this much dumbing down. I really dont understand how HOI had a portrait for every general in every country, equipment for every country, while this does not have that with, I suppose a bigger budget.

robothawk	Not Recommended	312.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053552103/	I personally spent so much damned time waiting for this game, convinced it would be everything I love from HOI3, but with better graphics, and a much smoother interface. What I got instead was an extremely watered down, and extremely incomplex game compared to its predecessor. While in HOI3 I could spend hours micromanaging an entire front for a couple days, or automate it all but a small 'Special Operations' unit under my direct command, HOI4 seems to take in favour of having the entire game automated. I enjoy the factory system, but it seems not well fleshed out compared to just following HOI3 BICE's method and adding different industry modifying plants, in addition to the IC system. Combat is boring and the entire game slows to a crawl due to the lack of propper army balancing. As Turkey I should not be able to single handedly conquer the Soviet Union, it should not be physically possible, at least not for a few hundred years.The game also lacks in the political spectrum, which HOI3 was not well known for either, though somehow Paradox managed to make it worse. Instead of having 6+ different political parties, many with differing ideologies or ministers or rules which would affect how you play, you have 4 ideologies. No Social Democrats vs Market Liberals, now it is Democratic, Fascist, Communist, or non-aligned, which disappears quickly enough with no way to bring it back.Overall I would like to like this game, but it is a world sandbox which starts in 1936, not a World War Two Grand Strategy Game, which is what was advertised.

AviatorMoser	Not Recommended	648.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aviatormoser/	Sadly, I thought the state of the game would improve immensely after a year since launch. But in reality, it's just in shambles. The game is largely ahistorical with the incompetent A.I. railroaded into bonehead decisions set out in a sequence of National Focus trees. There are just not enough checks on the A.I. before it does the stupidest things.- Such as Germany sending half its unescorted land forces around Africa into the attrition-high jungles of SE Asia to support Japan, even though it's not doing so well in its Russian offensive.- Such as the British incessantly invading German occupied Nazi Europe with tiny amphibious forces and repeatedly beingpushed back out in the seas.- Such as Italy abandoning North Africa for no good reason or just being complacent as it surrounded between Ethiopia and Egypt.- Such as the British Isles being so weakly defended that even the ahistorical Axis Spain will launch its own Sealion- Such as Operation Weserubung consisting of no invasion of Norway by Germany- Such as Fall Gelb executing in mid-winter 1939 instead of Spring, or Barbarossa commencing in March....- Such as Italy, with no solid control of the Mediterranean, abandoning the Boot to go elsewhere.- Such as non-sensical battle plans. Why will the AI divert valuable 12 divisions to surround a patch of land containing three enemy divisions beat down by attrition to 0% strength and 0% organiziation, and just stand around surrounding them for years without just taking them?!The game is absolutely broken. There is only an eight man team apparently working on this severely incomplete and underdeveloped game, with only one working on the biggest problem of them all, AI. Management of Paradox doesn't care. Why should you? Sadly, I will say it. Stay away from this game. Stay away from Paradox. What a huge disappointment. I really wanted to enjoy this game.
holychair	Not Recommended	18.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043053799/	Best GUI and nicest map of a HOI game yet, but  … the AI is frankly horrible beyond belief and thus singleplayer mode is an utter waste of time for any self-respecting wargamer. It’s not just that the scenarios are totally out of balance and NO single “hands off” run would ever come even somewhere close to what happened in WW2 (or at least would run along the lines of some of the more plausible “what ifs”). It’s rather that, despite a thousand things to do, the game doesn’t present even the slightest challenge – I’ve won easily with Bulgaria and other people have even conquered the world with Luxembourg. I’ve patiently waited for the patch before giving my vote, but now I decided it’s just no use. I used to be a betatester for early Paradox games, including the first HOI. Some say that oldtimers like me are just sore because HOI4 is a “sandbox game” game now and not a WW2 simulation anymore. But I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. “Sandbox game” is nothing but an euphemism to try and hide how unbalanced the scenarios are and how utterly bad the AI is.

tom "good posts" bomp	Not Recommended	170.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tombomp23/	This might sound weird for someone with so much play time, but it's mostly cause I *want* it to be good and even more that I really love exploring all the focus trees in the different mods and stuff. Whenever it comes to the actual warfare part it's either ludicrously fiddly or ludicrously easy. The game almost forces you to let the ai play out the wars but either you're so powerful you can just do a single offensive line and have the AI do it all or you set up a front line for every army group (which will get screwed up constantly so you have to fix it), draw out a proper plan (which you'll have to re-do every few minutes) and even then you'll probably end up just manually moving your soldiers (but you HAVE to do the AI plans because otherwise you don't get the extremely important planning bonus!)The AI is totally braindead - it doesn't understand how to use the focus trees so it'll end up doing really ridiculous things like having germany declaring war on the USSR while it's barely even started attacking France. For some reason it doesn't understand battle odds so it'll suicide itself onto your entrenched forces over and over until it runs out of manpower and equipment and loses. This doesn't just affect your opponents - because the same AI controls your forces you'll have to keep babysitting your troops so they don't do it. The division template system seems cool but it's extremely gameable and if you're not trying to game it it's totally opaque. The naval system is also a fiddly mess with no obvious strategy.If you do get it, do what I did and just play Kaiserreich. It's also very messy but the attention to detail and reams and reams of alternatives make it really fascinating to experience. It can't save the actual game but at least it's interesting.

In its current state after a few hours of play the issues with the game become bigger and bigger. Nothing is more fun than AI contributing very little to a war, before stealing mass amounts of land in the peace conference. Wait and see if expansions fix.

While there may be some a-historical focuses, or routes you can take, the game is simply not built around it. If you plan on wasting time in singleplayer or no rules multiplayer games i highly suggest you do not purchase this game. However if you are the type of guy who is interested in world war 2 history, strategy, teamwork, and time to sit around in an organized multiplayer lobby with a proper set of rules, you will find yourself addicted to this game beyond your greatest imagine.

Gary	Not Recommended	99.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198210296971/	The game uses a "World Tension" mechanic that I find extremely boring, frustrating, and that I believe was most likely an attempt at avoiding the challenge of programming a real AI that could actually respond in the national interests of each nation.  Instead of countries doing what would benefit them, once world tension reaches a certain point they will guarantee the independence of any nation, no matter how small and insignificant, no matter it's lack of strategic significance to the guaranteeing country, resulting in endless wars that make no strategic sense.  For example, the only difference between whether or not Brittan declares war on Germany when Germany makes a move on Poland is whether or not World tension is above or below 25%.  Also the battle plan system is absolute♥♥♥♥♥♥  It looks like a good system at first glance.  But when I started watching my units more closely in large offensives they were doing some really strange things.  They would stall out, stopping their advance well before reaching their objectives, even when the enemy they were facing was inferior.  I often found units moving from one end of my front line to the other for no apparent reason. It was not at all unusual to see infantry units swapping places along extend fronts.  Infantry at the extreme north end of an offensive line would suddenly move to the south, while infantry of the same type would move from the south to the north.  It made no ♥♥♥♥ing sense.A lot of the problems aren't apparent until you're well into the game.  I didn't really understand how ♥♥♥♥ed up the world tension mechanic was until I was trying my forth play through and started looking at online discussions to try and understand why the AI was doing such stupid things.  I didn't notice the problem with battle plans until my last play though.I grabbed a couple of mods that nerf the world tension mechanic, but when I went to start another game, I found myself exiting out as soon as it started.  I just couldn't bear to play another moment.  And to be honest, I can't really say I enjoyed any of my time with the game.  The thing is, it take so long to figure out what is going on that by the time you realize how ♥♥♥♥ed up it is you are way past the 2 hour refund period.Edit: Fixed spelling
RoyalWolf89	Not Recommended	144.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Royal-wolf/	I have loved playing Paradox games since 2004 where I played Hearts of Iron I. It pains me to admit that this game, in its current form, is not a finished product. I can not recommend this game in its current state. It has a whole lot of potential. But it has massive issues with the AI as well as design decisions that negatively impact the game. I've lost the will to play the game until the game resembles a finished product. What is wrong? Hollowness - The game feels hollow. A lot of features from previous HoI titles have been removed completely. Additionally the game has been dumbed down substantially. Hearts of Iron IV - The not-historical simulator - You can not play this game historically. The current AI is too drastic and makes very bad decisions. In example, if you start in 1936 and want to play Historically, then you can forget it. Anything can happen, and anything will happen. It's fun, if you like an unpredictable AI, but Paradox has given you the oppertunity to turn on/off Historical AI. In this case, the AI is never historical.  World War 2 never happened - World War 2 has changed name to "The German-Polish war" in the game. No matter who is axis and who is allied or where the battles are fought. When WW2 ... sorry, "The German-Polish War" starts Japan, Italy or Germany will declare war on random countries from time to time, which it never will invade nor has any interest in invading - i.e. Germany DOW'ing Peru, and Peru automatically joins the Allies in "The German-Polish War".  Generic Tech-tree and leader portraits - If you want a WW2 feeling, you should stick to playing only the Major Powers in the game. Every other country has the same generic tech-tree and same generic leader portraits.  Nuclear Bombs - Any country - even Ethiopia - can have Nukes in 1945.  Nuclear Bombs - Part two - Nukes are useless. They only inflict damage to a units Organisation. Nothing else.  Looking for a challenge as a minor nation? - Forget it. There is no challenge. You start off being behind Germany and other Major Nations, but you catch up technologywise in less than 2-3 years. Do you want to play Yugoslavia but you're afraid that Italy and Germany will invade you? No problem! Just change your entire country to a facist Yugoslavia in  LESS THAN A YEAR  and wupti! You are now a part of the Axis and can do whatever the hell you want.  Spreading idealogies and starting Civil Wars in every country - no matter the size. - Afraid Mighty USA or Mighty Germany will invade you? No worries! Just spread an enemy idealogy in their country for 0,5 Political and they will erupt into a Civil War in about a year. I played Nat. China and got dragged into a war with the Axis and Allies because of my AI-Ally Sinkiang. No worries, I just started Civil Wars in all Major Countries and neighbouring countries to weaken the enemies. Japan won vs China and was now huge. Being a clever little ♥♥♥♥er i simply started a communist civil war in their Beijing province, and soon after declared war on Japan and took all of their southeren provinces without any resistance due to them being occupied by the civil war. Afterwards, they were too weak to fight back. I did the same to USA, Germany, Italy, UK, France and various other small nations in the way of my glorious civil-war-spreading-Nationalist China.

Anderson	Not Recommended	162.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/falloutbr/	It will suffice to say that HOI4 has been my worse Paradox experience so far (and I loved HOI3, CK2, EU3&4 and Stellaris). This game needs serious fixing which sadly will only come with maybe 2 years of DLCs and patches, by then it will be costing +$100 USD. AI is completely brain dead, the front system is a mess and it is actually harder to micromanage your troops compared to HOI3 (which is as must since leaving matters to the AI is a bigger source of frustration than actually managing stuff yourself). The fact that this was released at this state really show how Paradox really cares about their costumers... If there's another side of the story, they probably ended up with this broken game due to really bad design decisions and lacking implementation and even after delaying it, couldn't salvage the whole think, so decided to let it loose and hope people wouldn't complain too much...
[BKG]Sanny	Not Recommended	208.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sannyboy1/	I cannot recommend this game in its current state. 6 months on and the game still has some base mechanics that require a rework. HoI IV Dev Team slightly changed over the Summer, it seems to be now understaffed (see AI & QA). Johan seems to not be involved at all. Podcat resumes a hands-on role. New Team Creative Director who seemed to have joined Paradox in June 2016 has no past experience on Paradox games or developing Hearts of Iron. Progress with updates is slow, especially with focus being put towards to the first expansion. PDS also seem to think that adding "difficulty levels" is a fix for underwhelming AI, and making players pay for battleplans that were promised originally in the game to fix a broken system is just plain unacceptable.At this stage Hearts of Iron IV should be further on 6 months later, but in reality it still feels like a month after release. Don't get me wrong it's still a fun game, but it's very shallow at this stage. Give it 1-2 years and I'm certain Paradox will be able to pull this around. I also want to voice my opinion on the community of this game, unlike other Paradox games, a large majority of the fan base are complete trash, from multiplayer games to the various forums this game is represented on. Many cheaters, Nazi trolls and people who discourage the developers from working on the game. Paradox have done absolutely nothing to contain this.I also think the new DLC policy which was carried over from CK2 and EUIV does not fit this game!

Although, there are so many incredible (free) mods out there for this game that give you a never-ending enjoyable experience. The CEO of Paradox released a statement basically saying he "will not give into a 'mob' in order to sustain his position and power." It appears that an authoritarian coup d'etat has succeeded in the company. If you want to protest this DLC policy, don't buy it and leave a bad review because they don't care about what you think they just want their money and that is exactly what you're giving them. Just download mods and free content. Probably not worth the original $40 price tag because of the lack of variation between most of the countries on the planet in the base game. Only 8 countries off the top of my head have their own focus tree which leaves many important countries like Spain and China with the same goals and focuses as other less important countries like El Salvador and Luxembourg, which as you can imagine is a problem. After you get into it and begin to have an understanding of what the hell is going on during the course of a playthrough, you'll find it to be shallow. If they added more custimization to domestic affairs such as border policies and tax etc., the game would be a lot more enjoyable since there are long periods of doing absolutely nothing but waiting. Vanilla game I'd give it a 7/10. Including the current DLC (as of June 2017), probably an 8/10.
BastianJolt	Not Recommended	272.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042761078/	If it wasn't for the AI being so bad that it doing anything even remotely competent will feel like jesus himself came down from the heavens to bless you and say GG i'd recommend this game. Sadly i have never in my life seen a strategy game with an AI this bad.  The AI will leave it's capital undefended, this happens way too often. If you're playing for example as nationalistic spain and join axis and the war against france the french AI will likely do 2 thing. 1 is nothing, it will just let you march straight up to paris without any opposition, or 2, mobilize it's entire army to the spanish french border and let the germans march to paris without putting up a fight. And if you play as the allies and naval invade italy in the south, chances are it's just gonna sit on the french border if france is still in the war and not do anything, leting you encircle and kill up to 100 divisons and knock italy out the war in like 1 month. Basically this is a complex game with a steep learning curve that becomes stupid easy once you've learnt it beacuse the AI is just dumb

It isnt the relaxing game anymore. I am going to downgrade to oak. It needed an update but not like this. YOU ARE ONLY MAKING IT HARDER TO PLAY WTF PARADOX. I do NOT recomend this to new players as much now because of how hard it is now and the tutorial wont save you. If you want to play the game properly you need to play it for long time... YET WHEN YOU FINNALY LEARN IT THEY ADD UPDATE WHICH ♥♥♥♥S UP EVERYTHING. For example you learned special forces are best late game and yet they limit you. You learn how to make good frontlines and stuff and they ♥♥♥♥ up the whole system by adding usseless army groups which make you micromanage the whole game even more. And the gaps that generals are creating? DISGUSTING!!! I am not going to even buy the DLC at this point like why would i? It just adds usseless tree decisions which were alredy there in the workshop. And also why the ♥♥♥♥ is every new DLC more and more Expensive?

It might be a confusing game at first, but after you get most of the things. It will be much easier and fun! I recommand to start with a non-major country. Because its harder. A lot harder at first.

Can't annex my new conquests since there are still pockets of resistance in the irrelevant quagmire of Europe. Which I didn't give a rat's♥♥♥♥♥about in the first place. People's Liberation Army marching through the streets of Tokyo, yet I still have to wait for the Soviet Union to finish mopping up in the West. Okay, fine. Fast forward 7 months. Soviets defeat Axis. Peace conference. 6 years of MY men, just mine, no allied troops, dying on foreign soil in Asia to stop and counter the Japanese agression apparently counts for nothing, as the Soviet Union takes all my conquests, puppets Japan and Korea and leaves me mired in my own feces. Oh, I got Sicily though. Which is nice and useful for a superpower in the Far East. Okay, ragequit.I have to say, in my head I'm comparing every aspect of the game to Hearts of Iron III. Improvements:- Production mechanics are greatly improved.- The game looks great in my opinion, although that's not that important in a grand strategy game.- The ability to make your country adopt any ideology you want it to have is a big pro for me.- Finally a working coup system, yet it may be too easy to gain support for them in other countries.Unacceptable crap:- Terribly oversimplified game in all aspects. The charm of Paradox's games was always the need to put some effort in, to get your♥♥♥♥♥steamrolled a few times while you slowly do better after a few playthroughs. Here I can just kick♥♥♥♥♥on the first try.- Trade? What is this?- Diplomacy? What's that?- Useless AI- No OOB's anymore. Organising and arranging my armies was one of the best aspects of HoI III. - As PRC I only got Mao Zedong, other generals are randomly generated from a pool of 3 name variations and 4 options for portraits. - It doesn't give me the feeling I'm involved in what's happening on the frontlines. The AI has too much power for the amount of intelligence it has.I could keep ranting, but let's just say this. I was hoping Stellaris was an incident in being a glorified arcade game. Of course Paradox wants to make money, and making the game attractive for a wider audience is a perfectly respectable choice, but I feel alienated, and from now I will never preorder one of their games again, and be very very very careful about buying any. There is still hope for this game, but its just a fool's hope.
NCBlizzard	Recommended	1,260.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ncblizzard/	Great game.This game is great to play, fun, and not only allows you recreate history, but also change it.There is also a large amount of mods that you can use to balance the game, like generals or economy, but also total overhaul ones, like Kaiserreich, which let's you play in a timeline where Germany won WW1.However, what lacks is the ideology conversion for Major Nations, only France holds this great idea.

Benny	Not Recommended	23.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shion366/	I cannot play this game anymore. At first it was fun, but the lack of immersion and removal of core features has killed the experience for me. Many parts of the game don't make sense but this is excused by calling them "abstractions". Even HoI3 had abstractions, for example leadership points. But this made sense since each country had a distinct number of leadership points along with tech practical that allowed specific focuses. HoI4 then further "abstracted" research by having only tech slots, with no practical or tech teams or anything. There are a dozen other examples of such poor abstraction but they all have the same result: taking depth out of the game so there are less options and very little distinctiveness between countries. This along with the poor AI is what leads to the strange outcomes that are usually seen, such as Germany losing the war by 1941 or so. There are some good additions however. The national focus tree is a good idea, but it is not properly balanced. Unit design and production is a wonderful advancement that I've always wanted, although even it is not right due to problems with resources and trade.Again, the game is fun if you want to live out your historical revenge fantasies without hardly any difficulty, and that is why so many people like it. But it is a Hearts of Iron game only in name, there is not the challenge or richness of content and features that existed in previous installments. I feel that all this was done due to the complaints that HoI3 was too "autistic" or "had too much micro" . The game really was not hard to get into, but it had somewhat of a learning curve and some things needed improvement so as to be easier to manage. However, it looks like Paradox went the easy route of removing features and simplifying the game instead of making it more accessible (which is NOT the same thing as watering down). Even if Paradox had completely forgotten about HoI3 and built the game off of HoI2, it would have been fine. But instead they decided to go off the rails and take the future of the series with them.
Lapi	Not Recommended	634.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LapLapLapi/	The Ai is not the best, this game needs heavy optimization especially for all the major bugs and exploits in the game.The game becomes laggy in late-game and tanks your performance immensely.But if you put all the bugs and bad performance aside, this game is quite good and singleplayer is enjoyable.I can't say the same about multiplayer.The servers are buggy as hell and the players are toxic(atleast from those games that require teamspeak).I wanted to play Canada in multiplayer(with Together for Victory), but i kept getting kicked because i needed a 1000 hours in-game according to the hosts.But then after a lot of kicking, they let me play Canada for the first time.Stalemates on all fronts, had my 3 tank divisions and 5 infantry divisions in Greece where Italy was standing there with 40 divisions next to Athens, i got told to hold that.I did battleplans in Greece so i could cut off those 40 divisions.It succeed, i pushed them back and all their divisions retreated back to the same provence.I pinned them down with my 5 divisions of infantry and moved my tanks around the flanks to kill them.all those 40 divisions starved out, told my allies about my victory in Greece and it ultimately ends with us winning.I cannot recommend this game in it's current state, wait till all the bugs have been fixed then it might be worth a try.
randomletters	Not Recommended	188.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969270039/	There is great potential here.Overall i am enjoying the game but parts of it seem like they are unfinished like air combat.It is very difficult to see what is going on with air combat if you are being bombed you only notice because the number of available factories drops. If you are bombing the enemy you have to click on every province to see if you are doing any damage and it is hard to see how many planes you are losing in that battle. Air combat needs a lot more visual feedback.The front system for land combat is interesting but not very intuitive. The in game tutorial is just lazy, it basically consists of "read the wiki". While i stil enjoy this game and play it i would not recommend it, a year or two from now and another $100 in DLC in it will probably be great, now it just feels unfinished. Recommend you get it for steam holiday sale 2018.

Zach	Recommended	299.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969134510/	So far so good,The two biggest changes this time around are the battle plan system, and a more simplified UI and gameplay. I'd definately say both of these changes were positive ones.The battle plans are an amazing way to reduce micro management, and I really wish they were in EU4. Also it's more or less optional, at any point you can grab some troops and order them around manually, and when they are done they'll get back to whatever battle plan you had going.So the gameplay this time around is simpler than previous games, which some people miss. But persionally I like being able to play the game without having everything automated. Seriously though, if a HOI3 fan every complains about "dumbing down" ask them if they played with their trade deals automated.Honestly, like a lot of Paradox games, I think they all have the same overall level of complexity, it just moves to other places. So for example you are no longer stockpiling resources, it's all flows now. But you are still stockpiling equipment, vehicles can have different variations, and every once in a while you'll research some new infantry equipment, or a tank, or a plane. Then you've got your entire army using the old gear while you build and resupply your units with the new equipment.Ignore the haters who are comparing fully patched HOI3 with 7 years of DLC to launch day HO4

josija21	Not Recommended	497.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197987280662/	I'm a big fan of the series but they dumbed down almost every element of the game (compared to HOI 3&2). This may makes the game more accessible but it ruins all of the joy and long term motivation of the game. The new game should allways have more (and better working) features than the predecessor, not less!Main Issues are:-Bad, very, very bad AI. How come the AI has become worse than in the previous games?! The Lines of AI-generals look like swiss cheese and as long as they feel superior in numbers they keep attacking in the most self-destructing ways, without any regard for there losses and the value of the gained position. And now you have to rely on this stupid AI, because micromanagment has become all messed up.-Same goes for diplomatic AI - when soviets can stroll trough axis territory (depsite beeing on the brink of war with them) and capture south africa from the allies you start wondering why they delayed this game for a year. How bad can it have been before?-No more support attacks, no more planed arrivals or sheduled attack times for multiple divisions. the manual stategic movement and shipment of troops is completly messed up.-The trading system is a warcrime! Why must i buy 8 pcs when i only need one? And why can't even isolated dictatorships decided what they want to export to the world market, and tho whom? What was wrong with the old trading system?-No more sending air or battleship support to a single important fight - now you have to order them to ridiculously big regions and loose all oversight. -For ground forces you have no chance to count your losses and compare them to the losses of your enemies after a battle ends. Ever heard of the term 'war of attrition', Paradox? What happened to all the statisitcs you could get in the previous games?-The new map sure looks nice but without terrain and weather filters it is useless for placing and moving your troops, this takes the rest of joy out of micromanagment.-Missing or broken supply-system for fleets and air wings (fleets can move and fight for years despite beeing cut off from friendly harbours)The few improvments:-the new production and equipment system (the only thing that became more complex compared to the older games)-they added peace conferences like in Europa Universalis-The Focus tree system is very helpfull in customising your nation-you can now stage armed coups in any other countryIn Grand Strategy I do not need fancy toyplanes flying over my map - Give me a working AI!!I recomend you wait untill they fix this game - as allways - with their countless DLCs and then buy a hopefully playable gold-edition.

Ripsnorting2.0	Not Recommended	363.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014187783/	It pains me to write a negative review of this. I followed development on the forums from the day it was announced. I waited years to play this game. And I managed 22 hours before I got too bored to keep playing. Compare that to HOI3 where I played for hundreds of hours even without mods. The depth of HOI4 is lacking and It is just too easy. Taking Russia with nearly no planning, in the winter and not even watching it. (had to micro my stupid naval invasions)Pros:-Industry is fun, fairly easy to understand-The 3D graphics are nice to look at-Music is good-The air system is awesome, so easy to useCons:-Not much depth (finished focus tree long before the game was over)-Tech tree doesn't really force you to make sacrifices in certain areas, way too easy to be current on all tech-Need a tool tip for why my naval invasion won't launch-What is even the point of half the vehicles you can reasearch? For instance the tank destroyers, they are never needed-I don't even think you have to use armored units or any speciality units, just throw in some anti tank guns and let mass infantry do the work. even as germans -AI is incompetent to say the least. Italy should not send half its troops to China in order to help the awful Japanese AI not lose.Conclusion: Potential for a lot but there is not enough depth and it is way too easy and i played on regular which was a decent enough challenge in HOI3, I can't stress enough how ridiculous it is to be able to beat Russia without paying any attention to the front.
(Lakega) Holy Athena	Not Recommended	16.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198041924801/	First things first. The reason I'm down voting is simply because they've taken a huge step back from what HOI was originally, and that's a Grand Strategy. This is by no means a "Grand Strategy" by any definition. That's not to be confused with "Strategy". It's a strategy game, but it's more in line with Risk Advanced, and Axis and Allies board game than a deep grand strategy game like HOI 3, HOI 2, etc. The mechanics have all been dumbed down tremendously, and everything overly simplifed. That's not to say its a bad game. It's a good game, but lovers of deep grand strategy games that had depth to the mechanics, this is not it. A Grand Strategy game is like HOI 3, where you had to control and balance deep mechanics across the game in every category. Tech tree wasn't simple. It was advanced, and had virtually limitless directions it could go and that you could focus on. Armies were broken up between HQ's, Battallions, Squads, etc. and each Theatre of war required balance, and focus. etc. HOI 4 is not this. What upsets me the most about HOI 4, is everything they did right, and all the ways they stream lined the UI with better army management could of all been done at the depth of HOI 3. Instead we get a more free range politics system, better UI, and better army management with everything else taking a huge hit in depth and meaning. A Grand Strategy is a game where depending on who you choose and where you start, depends on the unique challenges, and difficulties you're going to face. Want to start as Tibet in HOI3? You're going to have to play the political game hardcore, and decide on how you're going to defend and who you're going to support. Work on mediocre infantry, or push for the Guerrilla warfare, and encryption technology to allow your forces to hit n run. That's depth... But in HOI 4, none of that. As Tibet I can match Germany in technology. By 1942 I was rocking Atomic Bombs, and Jet Planes as Tibet. The Tech Tree, and Focuses were made in such a way to allow everyone to be damn near even in terms of everything.. You've just lost the grand in your strategy title. The reviews that state this game is just like past HOI's or isn't dumbed down but instead the UI was more stream lined are either trolls or complete idiots. I'll back up this claim by explaining how the game functions in comparison to its predecessors. --------------------------Armies were completely simplified. As I stated above, no HQ's, no battallions, etc. It's more like Risk. You grab a bunch of armies, blob them together, then tell them to protect a border, and when to advance. While the Division editor allows you to customize each division, and what it holds. it's still greatly simplifed in terms of the grand scheme of things. -------------------------The Tech Tree is yet another huge disappointment. The tech tree was dumbed down and made in a way that's similar to AoE, or ARPG, etc like Sid Meiers Civilization. Instead of having a massive grand tech tree, that allows you to really customize your units, and focus on a whole slew of different ways to fight your war, you're stuck with a hallway tech tree that everyone has and very little choices in fighting the war your way. While HOI 3 tech tree was a little overwhelming, that's how a Grand Strategy game is at the start. It's going to be overhwelming the first few times until you start playing it and learning. It wouldn't be a grand strategy otherwise. If you wanted ships with heavier armor, and speed, you could focus Ship Armor, and Engines in the tech tree. Now you can't. You can't tech your strategy for battles of attrition, or Guerilla warfare anymore, the choices for that are extremely limited if they exist at all. Tech to dig in, defense, staying hidden, with encryption tech to hide my units better, and large urban tech to hole down in cities is all but non existant. Instead of having a virtually unlimited amount of ability to research into hundreds of choices of tech, I get a simplified Sid Meiers style of tech tree where it gives me 1 base bonus and gg. Nothing else I can do about it. This leads to an insanely simplified game which destroys limitless amounts of possiblities to happen. In HOI 3 how high is your encryption? fighting tactics? How well is your soldiers equipped to fight in the terrain you want to wage war in? How are their resources, and equipment? None of those choices, or plans of strategy need to be asked anymore. ----------------------------------Trade again was extremely dumbed down. With basic requirements, and if you dont have enough or any resources, dont worry you can still make that ship with 0 steel and 0 oil. It'll just build a little bit slower... Are you Tibet? You want to trade with U.S. but didn't plan properly and got surrounded by enemies? No worries you can still trade with them despite having no planes and are surrounded. The Arcade mechanics got your back.. -------------------I can go on.. but I made my point..

While it still needs a bit of polishing here and there, I am very impressed with the feel and immersion of this installment. Even though they have shaved down some of the customization features that we were used to in Hearts Of Iron 3, I still feel there is a lot for me to control and for me to keep an eye on to make sure my country is headed in the right direction strategically, and I did not feel too limited on creating my armies, divisions, air forces, or naval fleets. One of the things I will miss is the ability to control how many different techs I can research by balancing out those resources with what is created for espionage, officer training, and Diplomacy such as the system available now in HoI3. Nonetheless, still a great installment!I highly recommend giving this one a chance! Thumbs up, Paradox!

Also considering the way Paradox do DLC's I cannot recommend this game, especially since they are making you pay for focus trees that should be free. Since this game is so focused around focus trees I think it's unacceptable that they charge you money for new ones. They're basically shipping a game where 80% of the nations are unplayable and then forcing you to pay 10-20 euros every couple months to get to play as a few more nations.Don't buy until they change pricing and DLC policy.

Front lines no longer work, your generals can only command up to 24 units which suck when you command hundreds of troops (I know you can get upgrades, but in my hours of playing this update a general has never had the RNG to get this option to upgrade) and border skirmishes allow you to eat up countries without a war if you just make a 3x3 Artillary regiment.Honestly, did they even play-test this update? Made a great game into a broken mess overnight.8/10 ---> 4/10.

Gollum Gaming	Not Recommended	15.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GollumGaming/	Although this game is a great idea, Paradox needs to rework how the combat works and make some major changes to other mechanics. In the end, the straw that broke the camel's back for me was that it was simply boring. Everything takes a long time to do, and even then, you are just met with a slight increase in something that you don't even need. Since the combat is bland, it feels like nothing ever really happens.

gravesplendour	Recommended	47.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gravesplendour/	Weird War 2 simulator.If you are new to Paradox games, this is the place to start. Easy to learn, difficult to master, this will have you commanding enormous divisions of men in some uncanny alternate WW2 in no time. Interface:The interface is much like other Paradox games - expect to see lots of menus and little 'action'. On the plus side, hover your mouse over just about anything in this game and you will get a helpful pop-up box giving you more information than you can possible need. I'd also like to add that simply clicking buttons in this game is a joy, it is so satisfying you will find yourself clicking on everything (which is probably the best way to learn how to play anyway!) Better yet, if there is ever anything you are failing to do (like issuing commands to troops, or researching tech) a pop-up will arrive and guide you.Graphics and Design: I have an I5-4460 and GTX 750TI, so a fairly budget setup, but this looks and plays smoothly without any lag. The screen is bright and colourful at all times and options menus are consistent with the period and mood of the game.Performance:Even when you are in the midst of a continent-spanning war the only time I see a drop in framerate is when the autosave function kicks in (and this can be turned off or turned down according to performance preference).Sound:Absolutely fantastic. Once again Andreas Waldetoft has put together a wonderful and appropriate soundtrack that you'll find yourself humming along to for days (I even heard my fiance singing it in the shower!) I don't think its in the same league as the Stellaris soundtrack, but if you wargame elsewhere on your PC or in real life, you'll be wanting to play this music to bring it to life!Gameplay:The typical gameplay experience consists of too many different elements to summarise here, but in short, you will need to select a National Focus which takes 70 days to execute and will constitute either a 'click' on the world clock, or a tock in your own research and development. So, for instance, the German Reich might select to remilitarise the Rhineland ('tick') or develop better infrastructure in its own nation ('tock'); the Japanese might select to go to war with China ('tick') or increase national pride allowing greater numbers of men to be recruited to service ('tock').You'll also be researching new technologies and battlefield theory to ensure that your nation is well-equipped and able to keep up with other nations in terms of nuclear armament, radar and air and naval combat. I'd have liked to have seen greater variety in the research tree for each nation (as there is for the main nations in the National Focus tree), but I know Paradox and this will arrive in the form of DLC.You'll also be organising your armed forces, airforce and navy. This will consist of producing goods to keep them armed (and building the factories to make these goods) as well as ordering them around once the poop hits the fan and everyone starts doing the murderous boogaloo. MY ADVICE: learn how to use the Battleplan system - do not try to give your troops individual orders. The game automates a lot of difficult and laborious decisions (is this division equipped sufficiently? can they access reserves? would they be better suited elsewhere on the frontline? etc.) If you constantly override the battleplanner the AI will freak out and you will get frustrated (see Arumba's first UK campaign, for instance).There is so much more to this game, but that should give you a feel for now. Verdict.+ Huge amount of things to do+ Strategic at both the macro and micro level+ Looks good, sounds great and plays beautifully+ You can make Britain facist (just like the Royal family wanted), ally with Germany and invade the US; alternatively, you can make Germany democratic and fulfil Chamberlain's promise of 'peace in our time'+/- At the moment there are only 8 nations with unique National Focus trees (though this should still give you 70-100 hours MINIMUM playtime)- Paradox is clearly holding some stuff back for DLC, but not enough to warrant holding off buying this- You'll have to put up with a lot of people moaning about the AI then demonstrably failing to play the game correctly (especially the battleplanner!)I wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is interested in Grand Strategy but a little intimidated; to anyone with even a passing interest in C20th politics or WW2; to anyone who wants to play a life-sapping digitised version of Flames of War.Absolutely chuffed I bought this : )

This would be a positive review on account of the fact that they're actively fixing these issues, but they're making us pay more money for these patches which are marketed as "DLC". It's disgusting and a ridiculous EA-like cash grab for a game I really enjoy, and I'm not paying for any of it. Nor will I play the game again unless Paradox fixes this. #PrayForParadox

AlBootYerBaws	Not Recommended	901.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198021954273/	The Game is not finished, hence don't buy it until most/all of their updates are released!!!When this game was released, I was hyped!! , the campaign map looked stunning and overall the gameplay was much more easier to understand. The addition of focus trees was smart and the improved Graphics is also a very welcomig feature. Pros:-Excellent new campaign map-Improved understanding of the game, particularly for new players like myself. -A SLIGHT improvement in immersion by seeing your troops move on the map and engage in combat. Cons:-Poor faction immersion, in short, US,UK,Italy,Japan and Soviet campaigns were very boring. -Lack of city building, in EU4 city building is a key feature, not in HOI4.-Short Campaign, I felt the start dates should have varied for different factions. E.g German campaign should have started in 1933, because this was the year Hitler came to power etc. Also the camapign ends in the late 1940s. If you play the game at full speed this can be completed in just a couple of hours you would be lucky to get 5 hours at full speed. I felt it should've extended into the cold war era. -Focus Trees, although the focus trees are a great addition to the game, again some factions have larger focus trees than others. In the Soviet Focus tree, you can pretty much complete this by the year 1942/3. Thats means you've got really not much left to do until you complete the game, hence making the expereince rather boring. -AI, was what killed it for me, e.g the Germans rather than attack a weak Soviet Union , they let you get stronger and attack you when you are in a strong position, Rommel would be twisting his grave. What can be done to improve the game?-Add original features from the original installment, e.g better trade interface. Trade in the form of exports happens automatically, not good.I personally would like to conduct my trade deals with factions i'm freindly with. -add more historical figures to the game. I noticed that in the politics tab, many faces were not put on the portaits of various historical figures, e.g Lavrenty Beria of the Soviet Union had a generic face.and tehre was only 6-9 advisors in politics for SU. Very lazy by paradox. More needs to be done. -Increase variety of 3D units in all factions and see their equipment improve on the map. Again another lazy move by Paradox, would've added more immersion to the game. -The AI of the opposing factions needs to be improved also, soem of them are just brain dead. -Make cities more unique on the campign map, make city building a new and interesting feature.-Make economic and dipolomatic side of the game more in depth and interesting. -Bring back HOI3 military structure. Military structure in HOI4 is dumbed down. To conclude,As a new player of HOI, I previously played HOI3 for a few months before this game's release and I thorughly enjoyed it. The only thing I did not like about HOI3 was the graphical side of things. PersonallyI I would like to see my troops move and engage in combat on the campaign map, it adds a lot more immersion. However, this game's achilles heel is the stripping down of features which were in the previous installment. For e.g I played as the Soviets in HOI3 and there was huge choice in the amount of Generals which I could hire to head my army, In HOI4 there wasn't a large variety of generals which you coud hire and the army structure had also been dumbed down. I felt that the game was mainly focused on the Germans, as they had a wider choice of generals and weapons. In short I felt that all the factions apart form the Germans was very boring and not in any way unique. The Soviets in particular  was very dissappointing. This game has great potential, but in its current state, it really is rather boring and drab. Hopefully this will change in upcoming updates!! 
MessyFingers	Not Recommended	486.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007100498/	Most recent update has made the AI, for lack of better words, pants ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you enjoy micromanaging things to a teeth gritting level, this is for you.So much of the game now revolves around exploiting whatever the current patch's meta is that it is also mostly unenjoyable, the likelihood of winning any war without being hamstrung by your allies assinine land grabs or puppetings makes having allies almost more of a hindrance if you plan on fighting more than one war.Thinking of building a navy? why bother at this point, a mass of naval bombers will destroy most any AI fleet as they really can't handle anything related to water.
Guvnor Gav	Not Recommended	750.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197981780917/	It was hard to make a review of this game because I love the franchise but dislike this game even though I want to love it.I will say that for all the negatives that came with Hearts of Iron 3, some of those issues have been improved upon, specifically air combat, but not by much. I found in 3 Air to Air combat was inaccurate, but now thats improved. However in 3, Air to Ground combat was great, and you even bomb units to their destruction, in 4, ground combat has little to no impact, certainly not in my experience.All the DLCs contain stuff I don't really care about and also expensive for little meaning ful content, were as 3's DLCs contained a bit of everything.I still play, but not as much as I used to. The mechanics are irregular, the AI is questionable at best, and for every one great thing about this game, there are at least 2 or 3 bad things.Perhaps its the removal of the micromanagement of the 3rd game is what sets this game apart for me. I know that aspect of 3 was not 100% popular but to remove it completely has had an effect for me. For example, in 3, you could capture land as part of a beach invasion, and straight away you could set up a supply chain of fuel and supply to assist your army. Now you capture terratory, it reverts to either the original country (e.g. France if you invade Normandy) or when I recaptured Crete my units started to crumble because Greece were in charge, but Greece had fallen.Airborne support is a joke and doesn't hold up to the greatness of 3, and a ton of commanders have been removed from the game. For example for the US, Generals Gavin and Taylor famed for their commands of the 82nd and 101st Airborne divisions are not featured. Why not? Even the UK and Germany have lost commanders who were famous in WW2. Like Hobart (armoured) and Browning (commando) for the UK. One of the noticable German commanders missing is Marcks.I hope over the next several months there are a lot of improvements, to make me change my mind about this game.If there is one thing I really do like is how you can customise your navy, airforce and armoured vehicles. as you gain points, you can upgrade certain features. For example, you can increase the AA capacity for Light Cruisers and Destroyers, as well as increasing the aircraft holds of Carriers. On tanks you can increase the speed or armour as well as guns and change their name, e.g Panzer Mk IV DThis game is screaming with potential, the devs just need to realise it and get there.
The Milkman	Recommended	708.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thetruemilkman/	A super engrossing strategy title that has sucked in way too much of my time of late. It is quite confusing at first and takes many hours to learn - in fact it's the only title where i've spent hours upon hours outside the game reading guides and watching tutorial videos just to learn how to play. However, once you get the basics figured out it becomes amazing. The only cons are that the game starts to chug along slowly in the latter stages when the entire globe becomes embroiled in war and the abhorrent DLC policy that shoves quality of life improvements and gameplay rebalances/changes under a monetary pay wall.
F-86F-30 >>> All	Recommended	296.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/B57StrategicJetBomber/	Hearts of Iron IV at its core is a good game, and due to that I will give it a recommended review. However, this is a good CASUAL game, and if you want something more serious, I would heavily reccomend starting out with Hearts Of Iron 3 instead. HOI4 improved in many aspects to HOI3 in terms of ease of use, but also lacked in some parts important to a strategy game. Starting out with Pros: The game is easy to get into, anyone can pick it up and be playing within an hourIncredibly fun to play with friends over a discord callEasy to use production systemsEquipment variant system not seen in the previous game Mods can either make you more immersed or just provide silly and dumb funFun zooming in and looking at the entirety of your front line with the models going aboutEasy to go alternate historyAnyone can win any war, provided the conditions are correctThe graphics and general UI are improvedEasy to use multiplayerThanks to the workshop, easy to use modsSo, all of these mean that its a great casual game. However, then there's where it starts to lack in, which is quite a few areas.Cons:Horrendously bad, crazy, stupid AI. The AI in this game is TERRIBLE. Spamming divisions in peace time, terrible division design, production management, naval use, air usage, construction orders, basically everything.The National Focus system is both good and bad, good for allowing the AI to easily go alternate history, bad because its basically also there to provide buffs and a clear path for the AI that would not even be remotely competent on its own. National Focuses allow minor powers like Luxembourg to get jet aircraft before the major powersThe above point doesn't even matter because all you need to win is numbers in air battles, just spam out thousands of outdated fighters and bombers, it doesn't matter how many you lose if you have the air superiority bonus that just provides flat % buffs to your ground units. The political power system is stupid, and so are research slots. HOI3 handled political power much, much better, allowing you to dedicate it into certain areas, like research, spying, or diplomacy. Playing multiplayer games with people you don't know is a mixed bagLag starts to get horrendous if you have either a slow computer or internetCORE GAME FEATURES MISSING AT LAUNCH, PROVIDED BY DLC. ---All in all, even though I prefer HOI3 to this, HOI4 still has its appealing points, and is admittably much friendlier to use than HOI3. TL;DR: hoi3 is better for realism and strategy, hoi4 is better for dumb fun with your friends or by yourself, and is easy to mod.

This game has great potential, but in its current state, it really is rather boring and drab. Hopefully this will change in upcoming updates!!

LegendofTotalWar	Recommended	625.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LegendofTotalWar/	Awesome World War II strategy game. It takes everything I loved about Hearts of Iron 3 and adds a bit more. It took a while to get used to but it was totally worth investing the effort. Pros - Complete sandbox experience with optional historical focus. Play history as it was meant to go down, or change it how you see fit. Any country is capable of adopting one of the 3 ideologies (facism, Communism, Democracy)- In depth economy that cannot be ignored. - Civilian population in every province that contribute to your total manpower. You can't just keep recruiting troops to infinity, eventually you run out if you're not careful. - Tradable goods are vital for production- Diplomacy is vital. Being a big bully will get a huge coalition breathing down your neck at some point. - Battlefield strategy is incredible. There are so many ways you can either crush your enemy or get crushed. - Stays true to the core concept the series was built on!Cons- Provincial supply system is sometimes really confusing. - The AI is probably a little bit stupid. They tend to make very suicidal charges and will happily charge over a river into a mountain with a lvl 10 fort and fight to the death with their attack/defense stat reduced to 0. They rarely realise when they're about to get surrounded, and make little effort to surround your forces. Overall I love the game. I give it 9/10. Needs more boobs though

Paradox has obviously become incredibly greedy, and has even made a 10 dollar DLC that is just pictures and words! Thats basically all, and gave Foci to probably the most uneeded nations to have a national foci.Buy the game, just dont get the DLC, use mods.

TheClosetMonster	Not Recommended	655.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheClosetMonster/	The game itself is a blast with mods. But thats the keyword: "MODS".The base game is is really quite shallow. Next to no diplomacy, you can't negotiate your way out of a war, resources aren't that important, AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and after a while it feels samey. But all of that, ALL OF THAT, can at least somewhat be fixed with mods. I know thats the wrong attitude to have ("oh, just mod it! its fine modded!), but thats the one that this game has. Mods can't fix everything however.And that leads me into the biggest problem I have. Basic, fundamental core gameplay, like technology sharing or puppet/satellite states are locked behind DLC paywalls. And I have no doubt that "features" like diplomacy or whatnot will also be locked behind a paywall. And hell, its been over a YEAR (365 days) since this game was released, and it really is almost the same as it was on release day. The DLC has been minimal, both in quantity and quality.Verdict? Buy the base game if you want to, the mods are fun and so is multiplayer. But honestly, don't buy the DLCs. Pirate them. With what Paradox has been pulling lately (in this last month or so), they do not deserve any of your money. I'm pretty sure a mod or whatever will block this post, but ♥♥♥♥ it. Just pirate the DLC, and be happier and save your money.

Today I learned this game will be charging as a paid DLC, the means to fix the abyssmal battle planning commands that let you steer your generals to victory. I am done with these money-grubbing mercenaries.
bombacimulayim	Not Recommended	405.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102686491/	Game is literally unplayable right now.  AI is a total mess. (ie. germany & italy move %80 of their forces to Saharan Desert because they feel it is convenient) new division templates and production system is innovative but AI cannot keep up with the idea. they spam weak divisions until they cannot be able to supoort these.  And also they move their forces to some strategically important places (ie. sahara desert) there is no challange if you are playing with a major power. Political sitiutaion is also a mess. countries declaring wars and guanterreining indepedences non stop. you will find a sitiation that allied forces fighting both axis and soviet union (unholy alliance accidentally) AI is always trying amphibious operations with small forces, it becomes boring to crush these. But in some instances it worsks. because İtaly , mobilised its whole army to sahara, cannot defend rome for some reason. (really it is that bad)For example if you are playing germany and defaeted Soviet union with your allies(ie italy) you will be diissapointed in most trivial way. they will claim some place in siberia becaouse they contirbuted a little and after your victory, italy will conqur a tundra in the middle russia which is 4000 km away from its mainland.İf you insist on playin, at least dont play with a minor country. Because you will neeed your allies in grand scheme and they have no idea what to do. belive me i tried. (Germany stacking all its forces to Spanish border but dont declare war, cannot be able defeat denmark for 2 years, declarig war on all sweden and stacking a huge army on a strait and cannot be abel to break since it is easily defendable)Just dont buy it now. Paradox will fix it after 3 or 4 patches. just wait for a DLC or a 6 months more and you will have a game worth playing.
Brosef Stalin	Not Recommended	192.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198022790729/	More than 1 year since release --> updated review.This is nothing like I expected. Gameplay is still poor at best. AI is woeful, but PDX have made AI core part of gameplay (manual control of units is penalised). Best features of gameplay are walled off by DLC. It's extortion to demand payment for something you thought you'd already paid for. Never buying again, HOI is dead now. Cheers PDX.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------It's not finished, pdx know it, and they don't care.The AI will abandon fronts for no reason/declare war without troops on a front/regularly allows easy encirclement.Air warfare is critical to gameplay, but the UI is unintelligible. Sea supply is a mystery, only selected convoys are interceptable. The battle of the Atlantic cannot occur.3/10. The graphics look flashy for HOI.

QuadN	Not Recommended	130.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026009171/	HOI4 is Paradoxes attempt at mainstreaming a hardcore World War Two sim into something easy to pick up and play so you dont need to learn. THE GOOD: Really easy to understand and play. Factory system is phenomonal. Suddenly airwarfare isn't as worthless and insane anymore. THE DEPENDS ON THE PERSON: Naval Warfare is dumbed down to who has the BB&CV Owns all Order Of Battle system is gone, this new crap is NOT an order of battle system. The Intrigue system has been basically removed and dumbed down to absolutely useless like the last game. THE BAD (THERES A♥♥♥♥♥♥TON.): Technology Tree has been dumbed down to nothing, you research mostly generic things that make no sense. Using EXP for upgrading and making better versions of units is WORTHLESS for anything being produced because you'd make less and by the time its done you'd should've researched a better tank. The AI is dumb, as in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. No i must say, the AI in this game doesn't know how to break through or make battleplans that make sense. The AI is also really easy to beat, even on insane i do not have problems invading anything. You have limited research slots meaning you need to prioritize army and air and dont research Anti-Tank/AA because they're worthless and the fact that certain technologies are just BETTER flat out than others such as Concentraited VS Diverse industry, Concentraited is just better because it gives you most of Diverse's buffs AND You can make more factories. States have random sizes and are not consistant meaning certain states can hold more factories but some regions can be more industrial. Subs are worthless and escort raiding just means raiding troop transports and thats it usually they also get detected and destroyed easily. For some ungoldy reason Nukes dont actually DO anything, i once dropped 11 nukes on japan and they only gave up once i invaded the state of Yamata/Tokyo (forgot its name). The Factions system doesnt make sense as a lot of nations will stay nuetral no matter what. Why the ♥♥♥♥ did i merge wars with Japan we're not even at war with the U.S. yet now i am forced too even though i am not allied with Japan and have been helping Chinia but now i am at war with them because some random ♥♥♥♥ing nation i hate invaded them. No seriously that can happen. Post-War borders are ♥♥♥♥ing UGLY. The peace conference system was a mistake its so ♥♥♥♥ing bad.  [EDIT.1] You will never need, or will ever get close to researching jets. By the time jets come around the war is already over. [EDIT.2] The DLC adds BASE GAME level♥♥♥♥♥♥ No seriously things like asking for lend-lease and vassal control is locked behind a paid DLC. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] The AI is actually worse now, its much, much more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and will NOT invade empty provinces. [EDIT.2][TFV] Did i mention that you require DLC to fix part of the game? I mean its still broke as ♥♥♥♥ but now its slightly more broken. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] Oh yeah theres a lot of focus trees that make no sense historically and infact make less sense than before. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] Forts break the AI. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] FORTS BREAK THE AI HARD. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] FORRRRRRRRRRRRTTTTTTTTTZZZZZZZZZZ [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] You can be communist Germany and the Americans still declare war on you for being facist. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] Same with the Soviet Union. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] Actually anyone can declare war on anyone else for any ♥♥♥♥ing reason because no one ♥♥♥♥ing cares. [EDIT.2][Death & Dishonor] Seriously ♥♥♥♥ this game.All in all DO NOT BUY THIS GAME, it may not be as glitchy as HOI3 but god damn its so much worse.
Nightstalker	Not Recommended	222.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011760211/	Well i think this one is the worst of any Hearts of Iron Series i have seen. It have dumped down on realism and details than the previous series. It look interesting, but when you play it for awhile and realize it doesnt feel like World War II in the history at all. Just another game, one thing i cant figured out how we get all these positive reviews? There are some games based on WWII are far more better than this one.Remember i have bought Hearts of Iron III and wasnt too impress with it, few years later it gotten pretty good and popular. Maybe they will improved this game in the future.
Rizla	Not Recommended	260.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kongrizla/	I had to rewrite my old rewiev, as I wanted to add more points to it. Going to try and make it in an ordered way. First of all, this game is supposed to be a game a bout WW2, but it fails so very very hard. Not one game has even resembled WW2 the slightest.What is goodNot everything is crap though. There are a few good things too. Production: I really like that you have to produce individual planes, equipment, tanks etc.  Variants: I like that you can make your own variants of planes, ships and tanks. Divisional designer: I like it. But not loving it. Too few optionas. Not every single divison should have to follow a template in my opinion. What if you would like one special template for one division? Sure, you can create a template just for that division, no problem. However, if you wan't to have several... It kind of gets messy after a while.What do I find bad... AI - really really bad. Germany can't even capture Denmark in some games. Makes all kind of stupid stuff. These stuff can and will be fixed eventually though.... Political Map / Borders: Completely useless. They have tried to make a "pretty" and "cute" fake 3D world that just don't work. If you zoom in you can barely seperate your own provinces from your enemy. It is especially bad if there is a front with a lot of units. Even worse if you have an ongoing battle-plan going on, it just clutters everything up really bad. Terrain Map: Doesn't exist. Paradox claim you don't need it... However, in some areas you can't seperate a jungle from a hill or a mountain, desert from a mountain or similar. It is just chaotic. You will have to click on the individual province to see what terrain it actually has. Battle plans: Idea behind it is good. But it is a failure as of now. The AI control handler in HOI3 was superior and your units actually could follow a path and function properly (if you handled it correctly). In HOI4 it may soon turn into an ugly mess. Also, the plans should be able to be hidden on an "army" to "army" basis. As of now, if more armies is at one front... Well, you soon can't see the province at all, the "plans" might cover everything up.OOB - No OOB anymore. No need appearantly. Some people like it that is really simple and not realistic. I myself, would have wanted Corps, Armies, Army Groups and Theaters back. And be able to give orders on each level. Lack of leaders: Way too few leaders. Might be because they have the new painted effect on them. But anyway, way too few and not historical.Fake leaders: you can generate new ones if you think it is too few. These however are fake generic ones, with generic portraits. It will annoy the heck out of anyone that is even remotely interested in WW2. Same with the Fighter Aces - they are also fake and generic. Fake events: Amelia Earhart might survive and guess what... She may become a FIGHTER ACE for the USA... History doesn't mean anything. Air Wings are just numbers. It's a number game. Just clik and place them. Delete them afterwards. No need to move them. They can be as big or small as you like too. History out the window."Armies" - well an "army" in HOI4 is a funny term really. It's just a blob. It can be of any size. Doesn't function as an army or anything else for that matter. It's just a group of units.Division names: You might have a 1st Infantry Divison already, yet the game INSISTS on building 1. Infantry Division again... You can ofcourse rename them... The AI on the other hand, does not. You will fight numerous 1. Infantry Division all around. They have names like: 1. Infantry Divison Type 1, Type 2, Type 3 etc. Naval: Just build a big stack. Will kill everything. Transports? No need for it. You can just convoy your divisions anywhere in the world. Messages? Have you lost your capital? Have there been an invasion, lost a provice? Has a unit been encircled or lost/killed? You don't get any pop-ups anymore. You get small notifications sometimes, but they doesn't necessary mean anything. If there really is an invasion going on, you would think a pop-up would be in order. No sub-units names anymore: They just "exist" - I personally don't like it, but some people may do and many won't care. I however, liked to have names and "souls" for the individual sub-units as well. Famous regiments etc.Ledger: Doesn't existNumber of divisions: The amount of units some nations have is just a joke.Easy: The game is way too easy in many aspects. As a minor you can quite easily become a major, not that hard to become a world dominator as minor either, and far too easy to get the nuclear bomb first... Non-historical: most aspects just don't follow history at all... Some says it is never intended to do so, it is meant to be a sandbox game only. Why then brand it and market it as a WW2 game? 3D units that looks like children toys - with silly animations doing pushups etc. No counters - well, there kind of is counters, but new ones when the old ones worked so well. The new ones don't work at all. They don't stack, they "merge" making it impossible to see what province they actually are based in unless zooming in. They are rectangular and way too small. You can luckily have NATO symbols on them, the standard ones you might see some youtubers play with are just awful and kills any immersion you may have left. Politics: Doesn't really exist. It's just neutral, communist, democrat or fascist. You can easily become anything withing a very short time. Playing any country, you can switch ideology.Espionage: Doesn't really exist. However, you can create civil wars in any country you wish, very easily. Trade? Doesn't exist. You can buy stuff, but you cannot sell. When someone buys from you, you get "civilian factories" in return. Fuel? Not needed. You build things faster, sure. But when built, ships/tanks/planes doesn't need fuel to function. They run on fairy dust. National focus thing: Well, I really can't see the point in this thing... Sure, you can get some stuff here and there. They are instead of events really. But too many non-historical-and-absolutely-nonsense focus ideas. Some are natural and good. However, the events in HOI3 was superior. You could then choose when to select an event at some times, for instance kicking of WW2 on september the 1st. Not possible in HOI4. Also, for fascist nations, not needed to going to war for anyhow. You can just go to war early and conquer all of Europe in 1936.WW2 will never be called WW2. It will most of the times be called "German Polish War" - even if Poland capitulated years ago. No more individual provinces... No names, no individual anything. Everything is "state-based" - what is a state you might ask? Well, so do I. For some nations it is actual states, for others it just... random, totally random and non-historical nonsense once again. Factories/infrastructure etc. I guess I could mention a whole lot more. But enough is enough. I feel this game is more for the "casual" gamer than don't need to learn a game. This game is really easy to learn. If you like games like Grigsby's War in the East or similar stay far away. Actually, if you liked EU4 you might like this, because this game resembles this more than any of the previous HOI games. It's just a random world where random stuff will happen. Just don't expect WW2. This game has NOTHING to do with WW2, and I feel a bit sad and hurt that it market and brands  itself that way.
lewishere2000	Not Recommended	73.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044881995/	I am a long time fan of Paradox games. But as much as it pains me to admit it. I can not recommend this game in its current state. It has a whole lot of potential. But it has massive issues with the AI as well as some stupid design decisions. To me it is unplayable in its current form. The main issue is a design decision to allow automatic military access if you have a mutual enemy. In theory this sounds ok. In practice it allows for weird situations. Such as a majority of the Japanese army sitting in Sweden because both the Soviet Union and Japan have Sweden as a mutual enemy. So Japan is then allowed to march its entire army across the Soviet Union. There are many posts about this issue on the Paradox forums. If you want a playable game wait for a few patches. When the game becomes playable I will delete this or write a review about how great it is.
Promy	Not Recommended	83.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198013284974/	I am a huge fan of Paradox games and especially HOI. The game is really good in most of its features. The worst thing about it is that after few years in the campaign the game starts feeling laggy. By the time you are 10 years in the game the game is just unplayable. If there is no fix for that I will hardly play it again.
taelengar	Not Recommended	21.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Taelengar/	Compared to HoI2 and HoI3, the game has had a lot of its complexity and appeal removed.  While there has been some improvement in unit production, every other aspect of the game has been streamlined and automated to death, to the point where the game is designed to be played by the AI on your behalf.  When you attempt the take control back, you'll find only the most basic options from the previous games are left.  There's no way currently to have the game alert you to important events, such as units arriving at a destination, or being attacked, or that some country is launching an amphibious invasion on one of your territories.At the moment the AI is so terrible that it has no idea how to fight a war.  It constantly gifts you victories by not defending vital provences and allowing units to be cut off and destroyed without any attempt to rescue them.HoI4 might be a good game in a couple of years, after a lot of updates and expansions, but right now it's not a good purchase for those who loved HoI2 and HoI3.
ANDROM€DA	Recommended	282.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GHOSTEMANE12/	An awesome game, it's totally worth 39,99 euro. It's a game were you can play it a lot without getting bored. The dlc's aren't a rip off. It keeps the interest for a long time. I really like it, I recommend to at least try it out especially if you like Strategy and WW2.
pingun96	Not Recommended	211.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pingun96/	Too expensive and simplified. The AI commanders are pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥and cant really manage your units. So you have to micromanage. Which is what they wanted you to stop doing because nobody had the patience to micromanage in HoI 3. The way they balance divisions is pretty much: high attack = low organization. Organization value means how long your men can fight. So if you have a lot of it you can fight for much longer than the enemy. This feels like a bad idea since it forces you to make divisions with less stuff like artillery or tanks since you wont be able to fight for a long time with them. You take a province with them, then the enemy pushes you back because your tanks dont know what to do after one battle.  The game feels like a EU IV mod with modern units really, you keep all your men on the frontline or you keep them miles away. Not like in HoI 3 where you kept divisions right behind the fronline in case the enemy pushed you back. The AI commander refuse to let you micromanage, it will take back control of your men all the time and move them away to other provinces, even if it causes a cap in the line. The game is pretty, looks neat, but weather and terrain view isnt in the game, theres terrain and weather though. You can see what terrain and weather there is on the map, but its not easy with the colours on the map that show your borders.Navies are a bit better than in HoI 3, but naval battles dosent show what each ship is doing like it did in HoI3, it shows how close they are to each others and if you hover on them with the mouse you see how damaged they are, thats it. The sound they always make when a naval battle start (even if its just a convoy being raided) is annoying and will make you want to commit a nuclear bombing on your own capital. Theres also no way to affect supply convoys. If you want to have a short convoy with supplies going over the english channel to England, as Germany with france conquered, you're fresh out of luck. Theres a much bigger chance your convoys will do the dumb thing and go from Germany, and travel trough two "sea regions" which the game divides the oceans into. Which makes them ripe picking for enemies ships. If you dont have A LOT of ships to send on convoy protection, and have a few to clear THE ENTIRE sea region out, you'll lose most of your supplies and re-enforcements at sea. Instead of letting you send ships from around france in a short distane. This is not guaranteed to happend, but it most likely will. Specially if you want to take out England quickly and dont want them to become a unbeatable island fort. Which they will become rather fast. Unless their AI decides to send all their toops to some colony somewhere. Colonies. They did the Europa Universalis thing and decided to let any big colony be a separate state who is puppeted by main nations. So dutch east indies arent a part of the Netherlands directly, but are a puppet on their own. Reducing your direct industrial and supply gain since the colony will be trying to create its own troops and supply them before sending you supplies. I'm rather sure they do send you supplies though. This is a dumb feature in my opinion. I can understand doing this to India. But the Dutch East Indies shouldn not count as a puppeted state, but more of a branch of the Dutch. Why? Well I've never heard of the dutch east indies having any form of plan or ability to break out of the Dutch nation and do its own united 'thing'. Just doesnt feel plausable. While i do feel like India should be a puppeted state. As it's actually a state which could have broken off from the English Empire if it had the proper channels and power. The game is too expensive with too many bugs right now. If it didnt have mods it would be unplayable. Its really made to be mass market and feels like a game you find for free on your phone. Its not a Hearts of Iron game, its more like a hybrid Europe Universalis and more manpower. If you loved Hearts of Iron 3 this game wont be like it much, the combat is too lacking to be apealing and the only real fun part is the industry mechanic. Too many features need work and a lot of changes will be needed to make it anywhere as deep and immensive as HoI 3 was. They mixed too much Europe Universalis into the game to make it a Hearts of Iron game. The game is hollow to the point a 10 year old can play this. And win. It just dosent feel serious anymore. Sometimes something will happend that makes you laugh i guess, but in the end its just too dumbed down to make you happy with the waste of 40 Euro or whatever price it is where you live. An issue with HoI 3 was that people didnt understand it right of the bat, and didnt really spend any time in the forum or thinking about it. This game fixed that by having a very simple and easy interface which tells you all you need to know, mostly. Exept when a battle is lost or won, the map itself cant show you if you lost ground in the war unless you knew the pre-war borders. and such. People choose to hate HoI 3 because they didnt understand it after their first try, and since you understand this game at the first try, they love it and shame any other opinion. Its a shame you cant really discuss this game with someone who likes it, they just tell you that you cant understand the game and that its gods own gift to mankind, while HoI 3 was the devil itself. The community really shows itself in gold in that manner, which is a shame. I really just hope they will fix the balance, high attack shouldnt mean forced short battles. The game was made to be mass market as hell, unlike Hearts of Iron 3 which had a learning curve that took a while to learn, this game got a 5 minute trip to learn everything. Really a shame that they took the series to this level just for the money. Also the tech tree ends in 1946, where in HoI 3 it ends in 1962 for many things, its dumbed down into oblivion. The AI is bad for an example, the Japanese cant ever win in china it seems, sometimes they do good untill they decide to base all their men in finland if they are in the same faction or declare war on the Soviet Union without having any men on those borders, after that Japan just turns into a island nation that never does anything ever again. I know this will be downvoted into hell, but its honestly the way of the game. I wouldnt buy it unless you are rich or unless its on a -50% sale. It just feels so hollow. If you are new to the series, its good, the game isnt deep and got a very tiny to unexisting learning curve. Its quick and fun unless the AI commanders ♥♥♥♥ it up for you. You can take over the world and do so pretty much without doing more than drawing some lines on the map. Its not a stressing game unless you try to micromanage. But its not worth the 40 Euro, if it was 20 Euro, or your respective local money in that price, it would have been a great game for the money. But sadly its just overpriced, its not worth it at this point.EDIT 2017 Summer sale. AI commanders still crap. Nothing new is added exept 20 Euro+ DLC's. Commanders have been improved a little, but this may just be my mods. But it is nowhere near enough. AI might be getting 'military power' points to improve their divisions without having to fight or do massive military drills, but i can not confirm this. I think this is the case because I've met the Soviet union in 1941 with different division designs from game to game. Which is weird because the Soviet Union rarely has any major comflicts in my games, usually. And divisions still cost A LOT to change. Mods can change this costs, but either the AI wont work with the mods (which means they do nothing and keep the same divisions) or the AI overuses these and will empty their manpower to make every division in the field invinsible. Untill you kill enough men so they cant replace them of course. Only improvement has been the Air force interface, looks better but mechanics are still 'odd'.
dragosmur	Not Recommended	12.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198036185463/	Automation mechanics is completely messed up. Units run around with no purpose in mind, walk thousands of km to fight a distant enemy instead of fighting the enemy in front of them. The best solution is to manually order them around.Can not make peace unless the enemy capitulates. No white peace here. No war goals. No negociation.War justification is stupid, there is no point in adding more provinces for justification when you can symply annex the entire country after you defeat them.They should have simply copied the war diplomacy system from Stellaris.Overall for me it caused more frustration than joy while playing.

animalshadow	Not Recommended	658.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002933633/	TL;DR:I've spent 500+ hours in HoI IV & probably will spend more, and it's second game where I got all achievements. Game indeed is fun and MP friendly. 1 MP session usually lasts 2-6 hours, depends on starting date & people you play with and in most parties is fun, but overall Hearts of Iron IV is a complete mess: SP is ahistorical surreal WW2 on LSD - Japan fighting for every inch of Vaterland while Germans scrambled to Africa and Asia taking back lost colonies while MP public games are not far from SP in case of madness, but good thing is that if you'll find good community you'll enjoy this game.Singleplayer:Not a challenge at all. AI is braindead. You can do whatever you want and AI will respond to this in best case by doing nothing, in worst AI will do absolutly dilusional "counter". That's it, SP is not interesting and not challenging.Multiplayer:Most fun part of the game, have some big pros and cons & it's enjoyement really dependable on community and house-rules.DLC:Check SteamDB and you'll be surprised, they've already reserved 56 DLCs(including 15 already released) - FIFTY SIX DLCs. Current game state and DLC count just don't correlate in my mind. Personal Preferences:I personally prefer Plausible WW2 where people don't build spacemarines templates, don't abuse game mechanics and don't do absolutely "stupid" things.I've found that 1939 start; Majors only; Common sense community, where there's no need of book size house rules; Where Allies are allies including Soviet Union - Yes, in most game USSR players are ignoring Allies or are ignored by Allies; and Axis are Axis. And that's the place where I spent my ~500 hours in-game and probably will spend more.Surely it depends on communities and people you play with, but most MP games are swarmed with cheesy tactics, exploits, meta and lack of common sense: "Spacemarines" Templates; Fort spam(Build 2nd Maginot anywhere in the world just in a year - easy); 1 Submarine glitches whole fleet(Probably fixed by 1.2 patch); Dilusional Minors; Half of world goes fascists cause Focus Tree bonus and etc. - It's most of MP games, if listed above is not fun for you, you still can find good community which match your taste.Game Machanics:I hope that this is first and last PDX experiment with game mechanics. Game is simplified to the level where it's absurdly becomes complex and not because there's lot of things to watch, to do or to babysit. No. Game lacks feedback to the player. You just don't understand what's going on. Game gives you so little information.Air warfare Air warfare is best example - all you know is that there is some air struggle and more planes you build more likely you'll win air "bonus". You don't know what enemy planes you encounter, you don't what's happening right now - seconds before you had air supperiority and area is green, then bam! Enemy teleported his whole air fleet to the region and are is red. That's it.  Bombing campaigns are blackboxes. You're bombing something, but don't have direct control on what you're bombing, all you know that N number of your Strategic bombers do some stuff, maybe they're bombing Reichstag, maybe Forts or maybe it's just village road somwhere 500 miles away from front line, you don't know and will not know, it's a mystery. Another good example are battlereports, they're gone. Somwhere near El Alamain was a huge battle, where you managed to encirle and destroy three Italian divisions - no one cares. You were invaded by 30+ German army group cause your Royal Navy was bugged by german sub - no one cares. Hamburg was captured by British Paras - no one cares. You have constantly monitor all your territory, cause one time you can suddenly find out that France was liberated and Americans are marching on Berlin.3D. 3D is everywhere.Map is looking really nice and beautiful, but again - not informative at all. It's really hard to say if there's a forest or a huge mountain or even a swamp. I understand that game designers idea was to show everything on the map where there will be no need in reports or schematic map, it's doubtedly ok if you control some small scale warfare - here are fighters flying, here tiny soldiers shooting at eachother backed up by CAS, but when it's about Total War, which WW2 was it's a mess on the map.There's no schematic map, if you'll turn off all 3D models and leave only NATO counters you'll end up with plain map without rivers, fortifications and counters which lack any info like their heading/attacking direction, their position on the map(Yes, they are just floating above 3D model, even you'll turn off 3D models).Focus Trees:I liked scripted system in HoI III, you was sure that everytime you'll play you'll get your WW2 with plausible shifts and if those plausible shifts happen mostly they are forced by you, Player.Here's everytime is something new and most of the time this "new" is absolutely surreal. To keep WW2 going as intended you have to play Germany, otherwise be ready to see something like this:*Worst scenario: Berlin is surrounded by Allies, but Hitler is sure that things are going well and it's time declare war on Denmark & Norway.*Not so bad scenario: Germans managed to occupy Europe, but really scarred to attack Soviet Union. Funnies part is that Soviet Union has troops concentrained on Romanian border and germans will be staring for ages into those wide distances looking for sneaky russkies who're definetly trying to cheat arians by not guarding their border.*Modified "Not so bad scenario" aka "Lunatic Hitler": Germans are staring on Soviet border while sneaky brits liberating France - closer they are to the Berlin, more confident in victory Hitler is by moving more and more troops to the Soviet border.Battleplans.On my opinion it's worst and not working as intended forced feature. If you're like me you probably expected from battleplans something like drawing plans in HoI 3 but with ability to attach units to them and execute: "Panzerkorps I & IV from both directions attack here, Infantry encirles remaining troops here, panzers advance further, Paras drop here...ohoh! Here's retreat line "in case of..."; Here's Plan B - This army goes here, 7th Army goes there, Marines invade on D+30 with heavy air support - Perfect! That's my version of Barbarossa." NO! Draw a line, then draw an arrow on enemy's capital. That's your battleplan! That's how it works Mannstein! That's how it should be done Zhukov! That's how real invasions were planned Eisenhower!OOB.There is no OOB. You just assign your swarm/blob to the tribe chief called in-game as "Marshal" with mistyrious ability to mentally command every unit in any spot on the Globe without any issue or delay and that's your OOB, enjoy it. Or you can make a little harder separate your tank to the "General" with "Panzer" trait. OOB ends here.MinorsMinors and developers love to the them is just beyond my imagination. Shortly: any minor(including Luxemburg and Bhutan) can be on same or few techs behind most of Major's and yes, there's no issue for them to develope nukes, it was such an easy task those days, that even Bhutan can make it.
the rotten cage	Not Recommended	548.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tizzly/	This WW2 strategy game is just really good, fun to play. But I have only three issues with this game.1. DLCs (Expansions) are way too expensive, even when the game itself is on discount, the DLCs cost more than the game! In my best opinion, some of these DLCs should either be in the game, or lower the price to $5.00 or less. I don't have that much money to afford one, plus, i'm not trying to look like a free-loader, but the DLCs prices are outrageous.2. The AI, the AI needs to be re-worked on in my opinion, because it's just very easy to beat countries, because of the♥♥♥♥♥♥AI, but some of you may be saying that there are some AI fixes in the Steam Workshop, I already know that, but the Paradox still gotta rework on the AI to make it look more realistic and better.3. The Mulitplayer. There are alot of issues with this gamemode, and there are reasons why I almost never or rarely play it. The first one is "Re-Sync" screen, when you're in the middle playing this game, you may receive a message saying "Re-Sync" this means that all players will have to wait until everyones loaded, and when this happens, and this shows the persons name which is causing the crash, and I know some reasons why is this happening, first being is because whichever the player caused the whole "Re-Sync" could be cheating or exploiting, you may see something like "Random Civilian Factories" on the bottom. (Don't remember the full text) and basically it's just very ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when griefers/exploiters cause this problem to lots of people in a lobby. The mulitplayer has to be re-worked on aswell. And the second issue I have with mulitplayer, (Well this will be player-related, some rants ahead) is where sometimes people who are hosting are toxic, like I remember one guy (His name is not "Player") being banned from the game and kicked out of our discord channel because he didn't pick a right country (Even tho all of the popular and minor countries ran out) the hoster was just being very ♥♥♥♥ing toxic, and yeah, this is why I don't play multiplayer that much.

Just horrid. There is NO historical anything in this game. Events dont exist for the most part. I played as germany. Before sept 39 i already had spain romaina bulgaria hungary czech, austria, latvia estonia  italy eitheopa yugoslavia.. greece.. and i hadnt fired a shot. Japan had taken china and all se asia. WTF ??? Oh ya this was while starting the game with history enabled... blinks... I had my industry already 3/4 maxed out. War hadnt started and i had 75percant of my war factory possible done.So i decided to attack poland. Ummm only a handfull of generals to choose from.  No more worrying about which general to put where. Anyhow i set up the new battle planner and set my guys to attack and some do some dont some run back and forth alone the entire front lines some charge deep and get encircled... again WTFIf there are spys and such i cant find them.  Prob woud suck anyhow. So no biggy :( I like Hoi 3 as i can manage what i want where i want when i want. I have historical choices and happening around the world.  Just a huge dissappointment.

⎛⎛LosTiger⎞⎞	Not Recommended	79.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988367888/	Ive never played any of Paradox Games before, but heard many good things about HOI4. And the youtube memes. So i bought it on sale, played it and really enjoyed my first 20-30 hours. Until i realized all the things that are bad at the game. The ai reminds me of the same problems with the ai at the total war series. Its far too easy to abuse them and the things they do make you just facepalm.The hud is very easy to use and self explainatory.While the order /frontline system of commanding armies seems confusing first, it does its job. Barely. Attacking with an army does work, but orders like the spearhead order which would be really important are locked behind dlc. Enemies often refuse to do an order or if you click on stop they keep attacking. Making your army conquer africa is annoying and clunky to do, despite they just walk most of the time trough undefended land. Some kind of capture territory order would be nice so they march just to capture as much territory as they can.How to use paratroopers is one of the most intuitive, clunky and buggy things in this game and i have almost never succeeded to make them work despite meeting all the requirements.The micromanagement can be so tedious especially if you fight sowjetunion. The frontline is often too wide to do an automatic one and a costume one always bugs out/does not expand after capturing territory sometimes. This could have been not so annoying if only a commander couldnt only command up to 24 units. Afterwards they get a huge penalty which makes you have like 15 commanders or so at the enemy frontline while drawing a frontline for each commander and an attack line aswell.Game mechanics are also full of flaws. First i tought that i just dont grasp the technical background of the air and naval warfare, but scrolling trough forums made me realize that aircraft is next to useless except maybe marine bombers or to be able to use paratroopers (and maybe atomic bombs which are useful to speed up capitulations) , and naval warfare unintuitive and clunky but a bit more useful to protect recource trading ships or to be able to use naval invasion. There is also no option to select a specific boat production and assign it to a fleet currently on the sea. Therefore you have to pick each boat on your own. There is also no real escape option from an battle except just sending them to repair themself..The countries barely care if i conquer the whole of africa, and never send real reinforcements. The only real threats are tiny suicide squads that attack with like 2-3 units behind enemy lines by landing on a shore with dozens of units some territories away. With threat i mean , a threat with your patience because they dig themselves in and you need to pull pack so many troops to kill them and it really destroy the credibillity of the game. No soldier would sign up to attack with 1k men or something against 1000k. Some kind of a better implemention of the morale system would have been better so people who are fighting would say no to a suicide mission most of the time.Resources are strange, you dont trade them for money but reserve factories for them? There is literally no trade system with money. Also you just need ressources to build things not to maintain them really. Why was africa/south russia so important again in ww2? OIL. I really like the concept of game but the negatives make the game almost unlikeable for me and therefore i cant really recommend the game on this state to anyone.Edit: Paradox keeps making new updates which are partially free and often improve the gameplay but do not fix any of the things i have said.6.5/10 Above average game
jiim	Not Recommended	51.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099830363/	It's a pity that there is no option for "neither good nor bad" to rate this game. I'm happy they have released this game but it's so unfinished and simplified, it's no longer paradox standard (or is it?). You can see they have knowingly prepared this game for tones of their overpriced DLCs (greedy bastards).Atmosphere is good, but doesn't feel historically, it's so easy to change history with not much effort. It's not bad you can do that it's just too easy.Battle plans are okay (but you need to look after them, they happen to split and do some random stuff if you won't watch [still not bad])Trade system is a joke, it's an insult for playersI was expecting more, I was even willing to vote for "yes", but I know that Paradox is greedy, cunning and did that on purpose to rip players pockets. Paradox - move away from the same slope as EA and Ubishit is.EDIT:After a little more time in this game I decided to play HoI 3, unless you prefer playing arcade game with no historical accurancy, play this version. HoI 3 was/is grand strategy game, this game is for casual players.

Or to try attacking across the strait to Sweden with 118 divisions only to get beaten by the dutch, since they have nothing left defending Germany.  Can't remember a game where Italy survived past 1940, since the AI doesn't bother defending against naval invasions.  A single UK unit can capture almost all of Italy before the AI bothers to respond.  And Japan?  Odds are they'll get wiped out by China.  Which I suppose doesn't matter, since they'll probably lose their fleet in the early going to England's mighty pacific fleet.

Lemeard	Recommended	53.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lemeard/	I don't normally write reviews but the garbage opinions on here is begging for me to make an exception.I've played Paradox games since Svea Rike III and Hearts of Iron since the first version came out. The previous version of HoI (3) was an absolute disaster and simply not enjoyable. Hearts of Iron IV was a better and more entertaining product on release than HoI 3 ever was.The trading system, the focus trees, and the research aspect (and even the air battles after they tinkered with it) are all functioning and fairly easy to use. HoI does not have as steep of a learning curve as some paradox games, such as Victoria or EUIV, and can be picked up by someone completely new to Paradox games (but interested in strategy). It is a solid game all around and I whole-heartedly recommend it.Two more points.First, the game is enjoyable in its vanilla state. You do *not* need DLCs for it to be a good game. You should also be able to figure out, for example based on a quick glance of the Steam page, that Paradox's business model is based around improving and expanding games through downloable content. Just go look at the number of DLCs for EUIV. If you don't want the DLCs and think they're too expensive you can always just not purchase them. Check out any of the great HOI mods instead, such as Kaiserreich. Or wait for a sale.Second, and this is one downside that I will agree with, the AI is not the most brilliant strategist out there. But there is a plethora of solutions to this. Up the difficulty. Play with friends in MP (which actually works. A pleasant Paradox surprise). Play a smaller nation. Set some roleplaying goals for yourself. And so forth.Over and out.

The engine runs worse than many actual legacy games I've played (Age of Empires I runs better in my experience) because - for some reason - someone at Paradox decided that running a game this big on a single thread (like even the rendering is done on the one thread, from what I can tell) was perfectly acceptable.

goodpoints	Not Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/goodpointscity/	See the thing is, the purpose of a military chain of command is to delegate responsibility. That is, having an actual OoB SHOULD make things easier on the supreme commander/god that the player is in this sort of game: they could give orders at Army or Corps level and expect an AI to do a reasonable job in executing them with the player only intervening at lower levels in critical situations. (see Command Ops 2 for an example of how this can work) Theoretically this was possible in HoI3, except it never worked because the AI was such garbage.  But instead of coding better AI, isn't it just easier to scrap the whole concept of a military hierarchy and try to make people believe that forcing the player to either use RTS-style control blobs or give individual orders to every single division is "streamlining"?  Ah yes, but the battle plans actually do something now. *draws arrow to Addis Ababa* *game decides that meant I wanted a leisurely advance along the entire front* "Hey uh guys, don't mean to bother you but it would be nice if you could conquer like all of Ethiopia sometime. I mean no pressure, I won't set a deadline. Just work at your own pace, take a few weeks off to move divisions back and forth across the front if you like. No worries."Apparently googling basic military organization is too difficult (or "micro") for your average idiot who wants to play, you know, a game about a big ol' war; but clicking  through dozens of generations and cadet houses of Karlings to manually reassign every Duke, Count, Baron, Mayor, and Bishop in the entire Byzantine Empire you just conquered with a single CB is EZPZ casual.But at least the artwork for the leaders is great. If I had to pick a favorite it would be either Portrait_Asia_Generic_3 or Portrait_Arabia_Generic_1.

We all know the Germans were complete bungholes in this period of history, but they got dem uniforms and panzers and whatnot.It is now late August, 1939, and Poland have refused to hand over Danzig. I've got 61 infantry divisions, 4 motorized SS divisions, 7 panzer divisions, 200 fighters, 160 bombers and 300 Stukas all lined up on their borders in 3 army groups. This will be my first invasion in Hearts of Iron 4 but I'm confident that when I start the game back up Danzig (and the rest of Poland) will be mine.Oh and I've got 19 infantry and 2 panzer divisions in the west too - a nice surprise for any sneaky Frenchmen who might have silly ideas about coming to Poland's aid.Oh and around 120 submarines incase any sneaky Britishmen get any ideas about sailing their navy into the Baltic and attempting shenanigans there.Oh and yes I recommend the game.

It comes mostly down to the your own units AI, that will just leave gaps on your frontline, or railroad off the frontline to a another side of the frontline creating a weak link. It is entirely possible to have more than half your frontline railroading around the battlefield completely reducing any defense you had in place. It has been several months since these bugs have been introduced and even with many people reporting issues, nothing has been done. Right now if I was considering buying the game, I would research the patch notes to see if things are fixed.
[PCA] Dire_Venom	Not Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142593308/	Take this more of a netural vote from someone who has played a lot of Paradox titles.Is the Game fun, interesting and complex?-Yes it is, and with a couple of visual mods it looks gorgous as well.Does the game work?-For the most part as long as you don't look beneath the hood.The main draw for me was slugging it out in the pacific with carriers, navel invasions and large navel battles.However, after enjoying the game for about 20 hours so far I've found Navel Combat to be beyound broken, I am getting attacked by my own planes, combat results are completly randomised (1 Destroyer sinking 17 of my subs and a carrier while my 200 Aircraft fly overhead doing nothing??)... not to mention my fleet shooting at ghost conveys (that weren't actually there) or not firing back while being attacked.For 2 and a half years since release this is simply not good enough, and has competly killed the play experiance for me.On the whole the rest of the game is decent, but for anyone remotly intrested in navel combat it's a complete flop.The Man The Guns dlc is coming sooon (tm), however from my experiance with 15+ previous Paradox DLC's I am not exactly hopefull that they will fix the glaring navel issues the game currently has.I would recommend the game if you plan on playing a land Locked country however ^_^
RiserBurn173	Not Recommended	536.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KeruxduNord/	Fundamental concepts are still broken in this game a year after launch.
JPSG	Recommended	771.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198081821114/	Despite the lacluster and terrible DLC, I wholeheartedly recommend this game if you're into historical and/or strategy games, It's much more acessible when compared to its predecessor, HOI 3, without sacrifing in complexity.
Sgt. Steiner	Recommended	175.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001584373/	Is this game worth $40? Of course not. In fact, not sure why I'm writing this review, as anyone with a remote interest in the game would have picked it up out of curiosity when it was on sale for $16.I bought on release and played about 100 hours straight. Then things started to get boring and the current DLCs have done nothing to spice things up. Very good mods of course, but they don't change the basic mechanics of the game very much. The upcoming DLC looks better. So wait for that to happen and get the base game on sale, if by some miracle you might not have bought it already. To me it is a little too much like the Supreme Ruler series, where you wind up with a blob of armies and no real strategy. SR series is an operational tease, and this game does not pose to be an operational game and can be forgiven for that.A couple of weeks ago, I fired up SSG's Battles in Italy (see Matrix site). It's a 12-year-old game I hadn't played in years. And I was shocked at the quality of the AI compared to all these wargames I am playing today. It is a true operational game with an editor best used to modify the existing scenarios. It also modified all the right things.So get it at Matrix, or wait for the next Christmas sale, then go to SSG's website and download all the custom scenarios for Battles in Italy. I am playing TAO5 (Ardennes Offensive) as the German, and it is simply brilliant. And also sad, that the computer wargaming industry has made such little progress with AI since 2005.

xXROUGEXx	Not Recommended	111.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044902407/	I have decided to rewrite my review a few months after release to give my over all impressions of the game and the future of the title. ****PROS*****The game on launch does feel like an epic WW2 grand strategy game, the gameplay can also be fun.*The sound track playing in the back ground is amazing and can also be enhanced with Sabaton. *There is "Less" but "More" to do in Hoi4 than Hoi3. Meaning that some of the "annoying" micromanaging has been removed but for the most part it was expanded on in areas that make the game more complex/immersive. *Naval and air invasions are easier to perform once you get the hang of the new system which is drastically different than Hoi3****Cons****Now is the part I dread, I have to really tear into this game.*The battle plan system is sloppy to say the least, you will find yourself CONSTANTLY fighting with the Ui to your "Battle line from expanding on it's own" meaning your neatly drawn battle plans pre war will all turn into garbled messes and become worthless in the first few weeks of the war. *The Ai is dumb, it prioritizes defending ports above all else, so even if the Ai is dying it won't pull troops from the rear that could potientially save it. *The Ai has no idea about supply, and will just shove as many divisions as it can into a warzone choking EVERYONE out of supplies. *The "Air control" is clunky and counter intuitive. Not to mention the constant ARMAGEDDON amount of planes that will end up over western France/English channel. *The Ai also does not know how to "Stop making divisions" so even if the Ai's manpower is sitting on zero it will still be attempting to make new divisions, often leading to the Ai getting "Cheat Manpower" as to not just die. Meaning by 1944 the Ai will have Zerg/Tyranid >HERESEY< level of troops. *The Ai will also do very weird things, >Australia invading Finland<.  Ya..... *Paradox is known now for their DLC policies, so you can expect to probably be paying $100-$300 (Other than the base game) for the complete game in a few years. I really want to give this game a good rating, I WANT TO LOVE IT. But I can't it's essientially a "Production simulator" rather than a WW2 simulator atm with very and counter intuitive Ai.

Jeromba	Not Recommended	60.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003168453/	Well, I gave this game chance, but enough is enough.PROs- beatiful graphics- armies creation & ground planning- unit design upgrades optionsCONsI will leave aside skins and other stuff presented in future DLCs, it is company policy and our choice to support or deny it.- no minimap, overall tragic HUD and UI good for games like EU or CK or even Stellaris right now, but not for strategy      where you manage multiple fronts in few years conflict- simplified research, especially in units variety- stupid AI unable to assess its options and power and accordingly react to historical events & national focus research leading to situations like Germany stuck for 2 years in Denmark and unable to invade Norway while declaring new and new wars on Sweden, Republican Spain ( which beats Nationalists in 99% ) etc. I didn't even get to German invasion to CCCP to see that disaster, playing to end of 1940 was enough.- units not use any resources while active, just production costs for new units and replacements. So trade enough oil, build enough planes and armor and do what you want. Your armored divisions won't consume any fuel on movement, hooraah for Germany, Russia awaits.- stupid simplified diplomacy based completely on 3 factions is ruining everything and assisting previous point in messing the game. Japan joins Axis in 1939, joining war against Allies while completely unprepared for this, Italy invades southern France from 1939, Great Britain invades Italy while Italians fight in Africa and other stupid unrealistic and completely crazy plans.- units numbers and losses likely more from WW1 - ground ops we can't see, because someone decided to commit statistic suicide and remove all stats books present in previous games and simplify it to overall manpower losses when you check War status. Oh COMMON PARADOX. What is this, game for kids?Number of air units is again unrealistic and stupid. I played as Germany, after declaring war on Poland it allied with France, GB etc. Few days after Allies had more than 3000 fighters + over 1000 bombers ruling the skies. Amount of losses coming from this is funny too. 500 planes lost in single day, lol. Keep it real Paradox, keep it real.I will not go on, I don't have nerves on it. Hearts of Iron was always presented as historical game which gave you chance to change that history. Well, there is no history in HoI IV, just bunch of focus research that try to simulate it and it does it really wrong which just completely messes whole game. If you want to play stupid historically inaccurate unrealistic simple so called deep strategy, go on and buy, otherwise get older games like HoI2 Darkest Hour, you will get more history, more realism, more fun. Sadly Paradox didn't take the best from old HoI games adding new features, but they created completely new concept, which at least for me is boring and not working. 
Norwegian	Recommended	202.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Noorwegian/	Are you a Hearts of Iron 3 player that never managed to learn the game, or are you new to the series and not sure if you should try it out? Well Hearts of Iron 4 is definitely the place to start. The tutorials are nice, and the game is much more easier to get into than Hearts of Iron 3 was. Even though the game has been 'simplified' in ways, it still provides quite a challenge, and if you're a veteran player I would definitely recommend this game for you too.The game isn't as complex as it was before, so it's way easier for a completely newcomer to Paradox games to get into it after a few hours of toying around in the game and watching some tutorials. The graphics in this game are a huge step-up from previous Paradox games, and the game really looks gorgeous. The diplomacy feature has been vastly improved, and it's always intriguing to plot coups in other nations and boosting your own party's popularity. Although, I do miss the intelligence system quite a bit, as I currently see no way to steal tech from your opponents or spy on your opponent's military movements. Overall Rating: 9/10 - Definitely would recommend, few quirks here and there but overall an amazing game.
Conservative Kong	Recommended	337.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/loafermadness/	When you buy this game, keep in mind that it's a war simulator and not a diplomatically focused one. The game is really fun, but the new Chain of Command system is really buggy, requiring heavy micromanaging whenever the AI decides to leave it exposed or completely abandon all togethor.Updates are consistent, so hopefully these oversites will be addressed.If you want a very lax RTS, and don't want to go through all the micromanaging other games tend to drown you with, you'd enjoy HOI 4. The DLC policy is NOT good, but unlike EU4 the game you buy is actually complete, even if some mods are needed. Before you play, watch a couple of videos, it helps a lot since the game might seem to overwhelm you at first.
Obermann	Recommended	519.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Obermann/	I loved HOI III with mods, and I still do.  I wouldn't quite compare HOI IV to HOI III, though.  It's much easier to get into for newer players, IMO.  They've also made offensives much simpler (for better or worse depending on who you ask), as the AI controls your troops during the attack.  You can still micro though if you like.  Also, HOI IV was built to support mods, from day one of development.My only complaint is the AI could use some work, and the devs have said they will be working on tweaking it.  Of course there will be more content in the upcoming DLCs as well.All in all, this is an outstanding game, with zero bugs in 25 hours of playing.  I wasn't let down mostly because they were very open with their World War Wednesday live streams, so I got exactly what I was promised.9/10

AI is a braindead toddler gamebreaking multiplayer cheats not getting fixed trade system is a joke (probably scheduled as DLC from day 1 of development) over simplistic research (wait for DLC, see above) no air Commanders (wait for DLC, see above) [insert any game feature here] (wait for DLC) -> SCNRIt's hillarious to see Germany sending 150 divisions to help Japan fighting China while Japan sends 130 divisions to help Germany fighting the Russians and both loose their wars while 75% of their armies are on ships for month the first time. The second time you're just thinking "wtf?", the third time "ok, I'm done with this". Only to mention one of the MANY many re.tar.ded things going on.So you think "ok, lets do some MP matches". Until you notice strange things going on like minor nations pumping out tank divisions like a major because of exploits. So you do a little research and read about that these exploits exist for month without getting fixed.So, SP is broken due to re.tar.ded AI, MP is broken due to gamebreaking exploits. We had 2 patches since launch which didn't improve anything and we have the first DLC at the horizon which will give us some new national focuses? WTF?Thanks Paradox, I'm done with your business model.

Mr. ATOMIC	Recommended	1,907.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197997619712/	So, it seems about time to finally make a review for HOI4.Coming as a HOI3 and Darkest Hour player, I'm mostly satisified with HOI4. It does make it more available to the casual player, meaning multiplayer is actually a thing in this. It also adds content and gameplay elements that were needed in the franchise, making an overall easier and more casual experience. It's now possible to finish a game in a few hours (faster if you know what you're doing) and it doesn't take days and even weeks as HOI3 Black Ice  (the best version of HOI3) did,  though it was an enjoyable experience nonetheless.However, of course, this streamlining does come at a cost. From repeated playthroughs, eventually, you'll see everything the AI is capable of, and thus, you'll be able to predict what it will do in a certain situation. Lucklily, Paradox is patching the AI currently so hopefully it will become better. The AI unlike the player, doesn't know how do something like retreat from a battle when it is being encircled, or that attacking a fort in a mountain with a single unit isn't a smart idea, or that by simply moving upwards it can surround the enemy, or that it needs to move troops to a certain front or risk being taken over. After a while, you'll see your own AI and the AI itself becoming predictable thus making it easy to counter it, making games sometimes predictable and a cake walk. The AI though, is in no way say Empire or Rome 2 Total War level bad however, and sometimes throws a curveball which is actually well enjoyed.So in summary, as a veteren of the HOI franchise, pick up HOI4 if you're interested in it. You can't go wrong. As patches come out, Paradox games usually get better so it'll likely be the same story here as more content and fixes are done to make the game more balanced and fun in repeated playthroughs. The game does have a lot of replayability, so you will be getting your money's worth. The modding community is already fantastic and offers thousands of more options when playing. However, if you're looking for a game which is a lot more complex and simulates a more complete experience of managing a country during a World War, pick up HOI3 (then download the Black Ice mod) or even Darkest Hour.

This is sadly the time I have to say: I do not recomend this gameThis game's AI is incompetent to the point of laughter. The most recent example: Germany and the Soviet Union had a total of 1000 divisions. The front line ran through moscow state (50 VP if you take Mocow itself). For over a year neither side deployed a single division in the state. There was a comically large battle for Kiev though. A lot of other features of the game need tons of polishing. And none of the major issues I have encountered and seen reported over the last months have been tackled.

I really liked  HOI3 and EU4 so I wanted to try this game but I never thought that developers could mess up a sequel so hard (sadly I ignored all the warnings before I bought it).Things that worked fine in Hoi3 were completely turned to♥♥♥♥♥♥ like the fleet management, supply system, airforce management. The ressource system looks simplified but will annoy the crap out of after you have adjusted your imports for the 100th time  (nothing is automised and you can only buy in huge quantities)The politics system is just pure nonsense.Countries have to create a wargoal (even fascist countries; it takes quite some time and uses ressources) Then when you finally managed to declare war you can't often attack because because your troops were in "neutral territory" (even if it is your ally or is puppet stateThe research system has been simplified to the max and you have to chose one of many combat doctrines. In other words, less freedom, les flexibility,  less complexity, less game content, less realism and it's annoying because you have to choose and click on a new tec after the one is finished.    Balancing and realism is just unbelievable messed up. Maybe they changed it so much for multiplayer so that every country is somehow "equal" or has more chances. But the result is pure crap. Small countries are much much stronger campared to HOI3 or REALITY. They got super tec because they only have 20% or 30% less research teams and apparently lots of arms industry. e.g. as Italy i got overrun by Spain which was almost as strong as Germany. So ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Then, when you win WW2, as I did with a communist Greece, there will be a peace conference where ofcourse you will be pulled over the barrel. You can annax almost no teritory even if you  did most of the fighting. Then the former Axis countries attack you and join the allies. So after WW2 you get 0 reward and fight against AXIS (who are for what ever reason are as strong as before) AND ALLIES

A.Wнιтᴇ Gнosт	Not Recommended	160.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SurVIVorOfThePlague/	Censored in Germany.No matter how you finally buy Hearts of Iron IV, the game must be activated via Steam. If it is bought from Germany, the buyer receives an independent German version. In contrast to the international versions, this does not contain a special, free DLC package, which retrofits symbols and portraits of the German side. These are pictures of the German NS leadership and of some Wehrmacht generals. In portraits of SS soldiers skull insignia were removed in the German version. In addition, sound files and graphics were changed in certain events. Pictures of Adolf Hitler were completely removed.Swastikas are not affected as the international version of Hearts of Iron IV does not include them. Paradox had already removed all swastikas as a patch for the 2002 original release of the game. Since Hearts of Iron II, the symbol no longer appears in the game series. Since then, the German side has used the black-and-white-red national flag from the empire, which was in use until 1935, or a Reichskriegsflagge modified with the Iron Cross. The portraits of well-known NS personalities were represented from the second game in the series only as black silhouettes. This annoys many players, as Hearts of Iron clearly sells itself as a historical simulation - hardly any other strategy game depicts the Second World War in its entirety so realistically.F*ck!ng censorship.
Chazzen	Not Recommended	794.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Chazzen01/	EDIT 5: AMD users have finally had their issues fixed. It's completely outrageous that Paradox let this go on with no solution for this long. Luckily, since Paradox didn't take any steps to fix it, AMD stepped-up and did it for them. The rest of the review still stands. Shallow game = still shallow.At the moment, I cannot recommend the game in its current state. It is one of the more bug-free releases from Paradox yet, which is a plus. But, the game does not feel feature complete. It seems very vapid, and empty. I have played around 60 campaigns so far through my 97 hours. I've been trying to get the same EU4/CK2 experience (or even HoI3/DH) as they had on release. The game itself looks very pretty, and can tide you over for a while, but it gets boring very quickly. Around half my hours+ are from trying mods. And now, they are already working on an expansion with paid features, with content that should have been in the game from the beginning. I don't know...this doesn't feel like Post-CK2 Paradox. This feels more like the old system they had: make a base game that's bare bones, then sell expansions which make the game worth playing.TL;DR: Dissapointing. Feels very lacklustre overall. Definitely not on-par to EU4/CK2 at their releases.EDIT 1 (12/28/16): It's been a while since I posted this review; a new expansion has been released since that time. The new release, titled 'Together for Victory', has been extremely lacklustre. It adds things that should have been in the game from the beginning, are simple additions that are in no-way creative, and simply down-right insulting to force as paid DLC (new option for planning). They also have the gaul to price the Expansion the same as the huge 'The Old Gods' CK2 DLC. TOG fundamentally changing things in the game, adding tons of depth, and a whole new time period. This is just one big slap in the face for those who have supported Paradox for so long. They are going back to their old pre-CK2 practices. That is just a complete shame. I have no doubt that HoI4 will be a good game in a few years time, but it is still utter crap right now. The AI is more broken than when I originally made this review, the gameplay is stale, and everything previously stated is still true. The best part is, is that they added way more bugs than the patch/expansion fixed. Ones that cause random CtDs for people now.I can 100% say that this purchase I made is not at all worth it. I have not played the game in months now, and have had almost no 'craving' or 'addiction' to it like with previous titles. My hours in the game were just trying to get used to everything and trying out the various mods for the game. I truly wish I would have waited (which I didn't do against my better judgement because of how great CK2 and EU4 were), and got the game at an extreme discount with a ton of the expansions bundled together way in the future. I would not have missed out on anything.Tl;DR 2: Do not get this if you are looking for a game with the depth of EU4/CK2. This game is a major let-down, and feels like Hearts of Iron Lite. Wait until the game has had many DLC/Expansions that fix the core gameplay. And then wait for it all to go on sale.EDIT 2 (05/11/2017): New DLC announced which is basically a ♥♥♥♥♥ier version of 'Together for Victory'. It adds small changes in regards to production for lend-lease type situations, and more of the focus-tree ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It is another $10 for a couple random minor nations. I don't get what the hell Paradox are doing. This is like full-on sellout level BS. Are they just going to keep pushing these ♥♥♥♥♥♥ focus trees? Or are they finally going to get their heads out of their asses and learn to make REAL expansions like ToG and AoW? I honestly don't know. They have pretty much already confirmed at least one more focus-tree DLC for Scandinavia, and I can see them doing random regions in Africa and South America as well. I really used to like Paradox but so many of their decisions in the past couple years have been so assinine. Anyways, below is what I wrote in response to one of the 'Developer Diaries' and thought it might give a little bit more insight into why I continue find this game such♥♥♥♥♥♥compared to previous titles:'Really disappointed with the kind of DLCs coming from Paradox recently. Where are the massive expansions like The Old Gods or Sword of Islam for CK2 and The Art War and Common Sense for EU4? These DLCs for HoI4 aren't even on the level of Conquest of Paradise and The Republic. All of which changed the game in significant ways. These DLCs for HoI4 are akin to 'Map Packs' in any random Call of Duty game. Focus trees are not worth the price you are asking. More depth of mechanics and country interaction would be. Just sick of the random small♥♥♥♥♥♥DLCs you guys are pushing for $15 and $10. Definitely will not be picking them up until they are dirt cheap. Just on principle.'EDIT 3: Currently, the game is broken for AMD users. If you have an AMD GPU the game will either not load (crashes when loading) or the flags for nations will all be black. This is not on the Paradox side of it, however. But, as this will significantly impact those with AMD cards, I just wanted to put this warning out there. Will remove this portion of the review if/when AMD or PDX fixes it.EDIT 4: I did a small overview for the issues AMD users are currently facing here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9U8RClwQ8o 
rlg007	Not Recommended	717.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965447908/	I can sum up this game in one word - Maddening (or I could say "broken")The main way to conduct AI battles, setting fronts and setting offensive attacks, it practically broken. Your troops alway, AND I MEAN ALWAYS, attack across the entire length of their front. This makes it impossible to create a real plan. I am sure people will tell me, "oh well, you can hover the mouse over your attack plan to show the route your troops will take." This works only until your troops take their first zone. Once your troops change the front line they change your plan an start attacking in all directions. Your troops dont hold the line and continue with your plan. The main focus of your attack isnt prioritized by the AI at all. The AI spreads out troops to support all attacks along the front equally, no matter where the plan tells them to attack. If the AI would just stick to the plan, no matter what, it would actually make the AI job easier, and require less programing which is why it makes no sense.I will give a small example - In a previous attack my troops broke through the enemy lines and gained a single zone on the other side of a river. This gave me a chance to strike northward and cut off some enemy troops. The zone bordered three enemy zones - one to the north, one east, and one south. I set my army's "front line" as just that one zone I owned. I drew a plan northward, they got ready, I clicked attack. Guess which way they attacked ? SOUTH !Edit #1 I went back to an earlier save to restart my invasion into Russia. I carefully drew all of the  offenses so that the previews only showed the zones I wanted to take. When I clicked "attack" once again my units attack across their whole front, sometimes not even in the zones I had marked. Some armies would attack in every direction but the direction I had marked. As I mentioned before, as the front line grows and your AI armies try to attack across the whole front, the broken'ness of the game becomes even more apparent. About once every 12 hours of game time I had to adjust my panzer groups front lines, just to prevent them from attacking in all directions. Once I got two armies close to their objective (Kiev), I had to manually select both armies (32 divisions total) and click once an hour (game time) just to get them to attack Kiev, aka follow the plan. I just sat there going, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, to get them to attack.Edit #2 Also your troops will refuse to fill in the front line you have made if that area has low supply. This is a problem when your battle plan includes 200-300 divisions attacking on the eastern front, you have to baby sit EVERY SINGLE ATTACK. You will set up a front line, or a few front lines from multiple armies, then when you go take care of something else. You will come back to find that the AI decided to send 1 out of 12 divisions because of supply problems, leaving your "front" empty. The game does not know what to do when supply is low. Also, the AI also spends about 20% of its time moving units around. I wouldnt be surprised if I had a front line sitting for a couple weeks that wasn't entrenched at all, because the AI moves units around.The game needs to go back to beta testing...

D3po	Not Recommended	1,160.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045413127/	Otherwise great concept and a challenging strategy game with steep learning curve is uttely ruined by bugs and very poor AI. This review is written after two patches by the developers, but the underlying issues don't seem to get resolved. I simply cannot recommend this title to anyone if you're looking to play as single player, which in it's current state is a source of endless frustration and rage.

leboji33	Not Recommended	74.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017368795/	Designed and tested by the developers as a multiplayer game, the ai in the game is sometimes missing, lacking all the time, and usually behaves quite randomly. As a single player game, there is nothing to recommend it. As my first HoI game, I spent 62.5 hours learning the basics and restarting games after a couple years to try something new, with the assumption that once the war really kicked off globally it would be fun. As it is, I wish I could have refunded the game.
Hardison	Not Recommended	200.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterMalicious/	Dont buy it, they are refusing to improve on the broken AI and pretty much a broken game, Then on top of that they are going to make you pay for a fixed game.. on top of what you paid for the game originally. wish i never took that leap of faith for paradox cause they screwed me on it.
The Boomstick Baron	Not Recommended	1,221.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198117812126/	Don't get me wrong, this is an excellent game. My problem with it is that it's noticeably incomplete. For instance, there's an empty slot in the battleplan commands, many leaders are missing portraits etc. I just wouldn't recommend getting this game on its own. For it to seem complete, you're going to need to pay an extra fifteen dollars for the Together For Victory DLC, in which case it's an even better experience.Edit: Now that the second DLC, Death or Dishonour is out, I'm pretty♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off at what Paradox has done. DoD messes with TfV's autonomy system for fascist nations, making some of the Together for Victory focus trees unplayable. Additionally, DoD seems somewhat half-arsed, it only adds features for four nations, skipping over Austria, Slovakia, Albania, Greece and Bulgaria completely (probably saving them for a later DLC). As far as the gameplay mechanic of licensing production is concerned, it's a feature for which I haven't found any use, but I'm sure that it will become crucial some time down the line with another update or DLC that'll work with it.

Shady Dave™	Recommended	473.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadyDaveEST/	Since HOI 4 has been out for a few months now I decided to change my original review because there have been some changes and my original review may not paint a accurate picture of the product.The good.UI is better than it has ever been plus it looks nice.The battle plan system is a good addition.There are a lot of great mods out that add to the games replay value.Sound design is good.There deffinetly is fun to be had.The airforce and navy management is less frustratign now.The peace conferences are decent. The nation with the most score takes what they want and if you dont wnat much you can give things to other nations, makes it feel pretty realistic.Multiplayer is more stable than in older paradox games.You no longer have to close the game if you want to go paly multiplayer with your friends or start a new game.The bad.Drawing a battle plan and having the AI execute it is nice but the AI is bad at it. Your army will advance very slowly and attack points in the enemy deffence where they will take heavy losses. Also your men don't exploit the gaps in the enemy line, but some how the enemy AI is able to do it so it seams very dumb.If you put your men on a front the ai will shuffle them around in idiotic ways, it will not put an equal number of troops on every province, it doesn't even prioritize provinces with hard to deffend terrain, it seams to just plop them on the line randomly and during battle it will shift men around the whole length of your line to create as many gaps as possible witch the enemy ai will step in to. Makes historic France really frustrating to play,The airforce management is better then in hoi 3 but it is still a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ plus late game whne oyu have  a lot of equipment taken from other nations good luck finding your new fighters from the list of crappy ww1 planes that you have to go through every time.Ai controlled nations still make stupid nonsense decisions even on historic AI focuses. Like a fascist revolution joining the commintern to fight against the people who  made the revolution happen or the USA declaring war on Finland who is holding off the USSR or  the USA declaring war on germany when it hasn't threatend a democratic nation yet but instead chose to go attack italy, the list goes on and on. This just makes it very hard to get immersed in the game keeps throwing silly♥♥♥♥♥♥at you.France is way too weak compared to other major powers. Theyr focus tree needs to be redone in my opinion to make them fun to paly post 1940.As a minor country in europe or south america your only option is to go fascist because the manpower you are given in the start is just a joke. And only the faschist tree gives you a decent enoguh manpower to actually  play the game. If you are democratic germany will just take you out, nothing you can really do about it, the USSR may be hungry for your land but as a friendly fascist you can join the axis and  you will also  have  the manpower you need to hold your ground against the red meness. Still, its a joke that as finland you start out with a manpower of sth like 7 thousend and then you are supposed to fight the winter war, but if you decide to go fascist you somehow have 100 thousend to work with, without having to change your laws.  I get that a fascist nation would have more men availoble but still in a gamepaly sense it just favours  one choice over the others and historically it makes no sense eather.There is NO way to get out of a war unless you get total victory. For faction vs faction it  sort of makes sense, because both sides wanted a total victory, but for example China vs Japan, you can play  a good game as china push the japs out of mainland asia and  after that , well i guess yo ubetter sit around and do nothing. Since japan will not  sue for peace. They lsoe theyr army and theyr foothold making it allmost impossible to acomplish theyr goals but they  can't end the war because the devs didn't think to put that in. Or as Finland or one of the baltic nations , you decide to hold your ground against the soviets and you do it well, you hold them for years and nothing, the soviets will just keep throwing men at you.  In one of my games they lost 11 million trying to take finland, well some of the casualties were inflicted by germany but still, they couldn't take a single province from me and the war would still last forever.This sort of thing ruins the immersion of the game.Little veriety in generic portraits. as a  minor nation you can have 10 twins leading your miltiary.The tutorials suck, if you are new then its better to go to youtube for the tutorials.Some nations soldiers wear shorts.AI likes that annoying guy on social media with its spam, you may be in theyr war allready but they will invite you again every few months. Would seam like an novice programmer could fix that problem with a simple line of code but aparently not.IF ♥♥♥♥pump is in gayasswar:    STOP ♥♥♥♥IGN ASKING.The game will feel shallow once you have about a hundred hours in. Spying or diplomacy don't really make an appearence, even though both were big parts  in the pre war years.In peace conferences the AI will do random stuff, like Hungary making a puppet out of some random nation in south america.  makes no sense but there you go. There is a mod to fix this issue. And just to be clear THE AI in this game is just bad. For exmaple i attacked Turkey from 2 sides but i forgot to put an army on the southern border and so when i started pushing in rapidly the turkish ai decided it would be a good idea to rush msot of theyr dudes to take territory in africa even though they got cut off from theyr own land pretty much right away and that made it even easyer to kill thme. So the traditional paradox 1 division running around being annoying ai is still present.Naval invasio nalrets are misleading, since some times it means there is an invasion and sometimes when you click on it, there is nothing happening. When fighting england you wil lhear the the alert  so much that you have to turn  the sound off, and   99 percent of those alerts are false alarms, and then  at one point you look at the big picture and yousee  your troops are surrounded and there is a massive red bloob in the area, sicne ifyou put troops on garrison what they will do is jsut sit there and get  beaten up. Not react to threats that are comign into the area.maybe an alert for losign territory off screen would have been a good idea but then again i am not a game designer so what do i know.The AI can not deffend against naval invasions. There is an option to send equipment to other nations but the AI never uses it.The game is stable for the most part but fun glitches still happen. Most recent one i had was when my infantry equipment melted, i tryed to put a stop to it by dispanding all my  divisions but still my best guns just kept melting. Or time the italians decided to do a fun dance on my border by movign men back and fourth and causing massive attrition to themselves, but i suspect the ai doesnt take that much of a penalty since whenever i check how the AI is doing they have a massive defficit of everything they use and yet somehow they still make units.IN SUMMARY Wait for a sale or go sail the seas of piracy.ALSOThe man responsible for the AI needs to be fired ... out of a cannon ... into the sun.
All American	Recommended	652.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/all_american/	Honestly I was expecting it to be in a far worse state in launch than it currently is, it still has flaws but overall pretty satisfactory for my liking. Great and deepened factory, research, trade and diplomacy stuff. It really feels as if you're leading your entire country throughout the war, not just your army as it was in HoI3. AI needs work, no doubt on that. The game still has many months or even years to go, but it really did exceed my expectations. 7,8/10.

Its not just the fact it is 15 bucks for what ammounts to new focus trees for some nations ( things mods do already) while adding very little else that is worth the money save one feature. That is the Blitz command for battleplans which NEEDED to be in the core game. Its one thing if battleplans were optional but since paradox was hellbent to make you feel you have to use it thats not a option. To leave out such a key feature for somthing so critcal for the base gameplay behind a 15 dollar paywall dlc that gives little else is not only greedy, its downright a stab in the back of those loyal to paradox. Blitz option should of been in the core game or a free DLC but if not then atleast dont charge us 15 bucks for it and some focus trees modders will have already given us better options for.

DurFieldmarshal	Not Recommended	303.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005853691/	Background: I'm a huge Paradox fan and my favorite game of theirs after I started playing it was Hearts of Iron. I started playing HoI III, so I don't have experience with older titles, but I did thoroughly enjoy that game. So, when IV first came out, I was very excited as many of the ideas implemented in the game were exactly what I was looking for. There are significant improvements to production, division training and equipment, and the national focus trees are significant improvements in concept over their HoI III counterparts. I played this game quite a bit when it first came out. It was fun. However, something was just not right about it. It seemed unpolished. The AI wass maddeningly awful and not disguised in any way, the front system wonky, and after three attempts I could not get something even resembling a historical World War II up to Barbarossa to go off. As Germany (who is supposed to be in control through the beginning of the war), I'd steam roll Poland and the Western Allies easily and close to on schedule, but then the AI goes berserk and the war with the USSR always shot off early for one reason or another.  The Eastern Front is where the weird battle plan system completely falls apart and for all the micromanagement it is supposed to save you, I end up doing more than I ever did in HoI III because my units always would try to redeploy themselves in nonsensical patterns. Frustrated, I stopped playing for a while as I hoped the kinks would be worked out. Fast forward a couple of years and I have attempted to play recently. Honestly, I'm even more disappointed in the game than I was the last time I played. Playing as Japan, I conquered Java and for some reason, while I wasn't paying attention, my units decided to ship themselves back to Kyushu. The German AI is completely stupid, so they had already been run over by late 1941 (but, for some reason, Italy was making advances into both the USSR and Western Allies), so I decided to hop over and play as them in a different game. Same as before above, except I didn't make it to Barbarossa because I could already tell between my two campaigns how broken the spaghetti noodle frontline system really is. Oh, and I lost 15 infantry divisions because they decided to ship themselves into the North Sea after I conquered the Netherlands because I was busy microing my tanks in France.The only challenge in this game is making sure your armies don't randomly fall into an ocean or decide it would be better to switch spots with another division a few hundred kilometres away along the front. Other than that, the only thing to do is to figure out what division model or capital ship you want to spam and just build as many of them as possible before you have to use them. You can't even fight World War II either because the diplomatic AI even on historical focus just goes bananas once the winter war begins. It's so broken they had to force Japan into the made up faction "East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere" instead of actually joining the Axis (I know it was their war goal to create that, but to have them make that faction INSTEAD of joining the Axis just shows how much World War II is broken). It saddens me because many of the grand strategy elements, such as production and the focus tree, are significant improvements over previous series installments, but the fundamentally broken, unchallenging AI, lack of strageic choice in terms of best combat build (the best type of division/ship is the best type of division in nearly all circumstances, unlike HoI III where each type of division and ship had a role to play when used properly), and buggy frontline system just make this game unenjoyable in my view. I have HoI III loaded up so I can actually play a World War II game.
khalid	Recommended	345.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991361994/	To be honest and unbaised this game is one of the best strategy games ever made. Very intelligent interface and without any bugs. The AI helps you in planning and strategizing and assists you in making grand plans. It is an amazing fun game really you can play any countery you want and change the world history. This game definatly worth more then its price. It is based on my long gaming experience one of the best games ever made try it and trust me. You must watch the tutorial videos to understand the different comands of the game as everything is linked. for example you need to keep your troops well supplied even if you have a million army standing on the border if they are not well supplied they will collapse. How to keep them well supplied by infrastructure upgrade and by carefully choosing thier equipment and by stocking equipment. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED GAME

Tyrranus	Not Recommended	98.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116745143/	Ive been a fan of Paradox titles for ages, and I have every HoI title/spinoff, dlc, and expansion pack since HoI2 was new/ I have spent gods only know how many hours as various nations and enjoyed most every second of it. Until now.f*ck HoI4... seriously f*ck this bullsh!t, I got it for 50% off and for the first time ever(with a HoI title), I feel utterly ripped off. Its not even the wonko AI or bugs, or the DLC with game mechanic elements that really should have been in the core game. Nope its the war and lack of diplomacy.I dont care if your general is Ares himself!2 divisions, cut off from any air support, being bombed, and attacked by 22 divisions on all sides but one, including motorized, mechanized, armor, infantry with full artillery rocket artillery, anti-tank, anti-air, mash units etc....YOU LOSEbut nope, not in HoI 4Stuck in a deadlocked war with a front line that hasn't gone anywhere in 3 years?? Want to sue for peace and resolve things or even attempt it?? TOO BAD!! You cant even think of that unless you wade into every participating enemy nation and utterly conquer their core regions!As a final, much lesser complaint... if your enemy declares war on anyone, they are automatically allied to you and subsumed into your faction.... Meaning when tiny/weak nations get slaughtered they hurt your war score, making peace even less able to happen.

I have not and will not buy any of their DLC if they continue with the current policy that they are employing for EUIV and this game. Creating $15-$30 DLC every four to six months is ridiculous and a blatant cash grab.Also, while it can be fun, it should be noted that even a year and a half after its initial release, this game still feels unfinished, and its mechanics are drastically dumbed down from previous games. If you want a more complex game, I recommend Darkest Hour instead.

Moreander	Recommended	60.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/moreander/	I personally like playing "weird" nations, Tibet, Iran, and the likes. They just have the generic Tech tree and focus tree, they don't have enough portraits for even 5 seperate characters, still I think it's fun to find out what can happen. I would like to see more options for those types of countries in the base-game, but that's not the case and they haven't been addressed in any of the current DLC's and quite honestly I don't see it happening either.Despite that, I'm having fun. Take my current playthrough as Iran. Historically, Iran is supposed to be attacked by both Britain and the Soviet Union in September of 41 (ish), didn't happen in my playthrough, also the Hindenburg didn't crash and the German Reich now covers about a third of the entire world's landmass, add Italy's and Japan's coverage and we're talking more than 50% of the world in hands of the Axis, including Hawai'i :(. Iran has absolutely no role to play, I'm just watching events unfold around me and try to build up some troops in the vain hope that I might survive being attacked by just about anyone. It's May of 47, WWII has gone on for two years more than it's supposed to and the end is not in sight, what will happen?
Detective Nick	Not Recommended	235.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jeffnick/	I have hundreds to thousands of hours experience in EACH of hoi3, eu3, eu4.  HOI4 is the game I was afraid (and kind of expecting) after seeing 2 or so of the dev diaries.  They over simplified and removed the OPTION to make it complex.  The UI and ease of management continues to suck.First, people say the UI is greatly improved since hoi3.  This is false.  The UI is worse.  In HOI3 you could drill down to very granular, specific data.  You started fairly basic on the maps, but if you wanted to, you could really dig down and look at stats, compare them, etc.  Not in HOI4.  Two examples:  1) Something really ♥♥♥♥ing simple:  editing a division template.  Well, all you get when you add a new unit to the division template is a giant green or red arrow next to each stat indicating which stats increase/decrease.  Even if you hover you get ZERO indication of how much each stat for the division is increasing.  This results in you adding/removing the new unit 15 times to see which stats are increasing/decreasing by how much.  2) In the air wing there is a display at the top showing how many of each plane class (CAS/FTR/TAC/STR/etc) you have in reserves.  Except when you hover that icon, instead of Oh, I dunno, displaying the quantity of specific models you have in reserves (so if you hovered fighter, it would says 150 BF109s, 100 FW190s, etc)  it literally says "300 fighters".  You see, I already knew there was 300 ♥♥♥♥ing fighters because it says that just looking at it.They removed OOB.  Which, if you want to actually micro your fights/fronts, etc, is completely and utterly necessary to keep things organized.  Now you get army-level (in the OOB) spam and they only rotate like... 9 different colors.  At times I was spending more time changing ♥♥♥♥ing colors than fighting.  Research is boring and stupid.  You don't research technologies anymore, you research products.  They took sort of this hybrid HOI2 and extremely dumbed down HOI3 to create whatever the ♥♥♥♥ is in the game now.  Yay, let's research fighter 1, fighter 2, fighter 3, fighter 4.  SO EXCITING.  My fighters feel really special.  Wait no, they're the same as every ♥♥♥♥ing other nation.There's no feedback on how air or naval combat is going, unless you actively go looking for it.  This means your entire air space could be going to♥♥♥♥♥♥and you'd have no idea.The battle plan system is complete and utter♥♥♥♥♥♥   The strongest tactic in the game: "pincer and encircle" is completey ♥♥♥♥ing impossible to plan/execute with their♥♥♥♥♥♥battle plan system.  If you want any type of semi control over the♥♥♥♥♥♥battle plan system, you have to create tons of armies, and keep updating your plans, and then your entire map is covered with gigantic front and offensive line ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Also, how the ♥♥♥♥ do you change the directionality of the offensive line?  Everytime I try to create an offensive line of infantry to fill in behind my pincer prong, it makes it with the wrong directionality.Zero resource maintenance?  AHAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHAHA.   SPAM BUILD EVERYTHING.  There's no reason not to have 7 billion panzer divisions, cause ♥♥♥♥, they clearly don't use any oil.Why is there no button to auto-trade for necessary imports required for production from closest allies? I could go on.  Like, the tooltips for national focuses are generally confusing and don't tell you♥♥♥♥♥♥about events.  They did fix one thing though from HOI3.  And that is the supply system.  Good job.Edit...More UI ♥♥♥♥♥iness:  Want to change the reinforce limit of an air wing?  Why yes, I would love a slide bar from 0 to 5000 (or whatever it is).  NO, I ♥♥♥♥ing wouldn't.  I would like a text box so I can type in "100".

mikec_81	Not Recommended	67.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mikec81/	Just some semi organized thoughts after more time spent in the game. I do not feel awful spending money on the game but I sure am glad I got the GreenManGaming discount. 30 dollars for 30 hours of time spent of reasonably good fun but I am unsure how more I can sink into this game with some pretty glaring flaws that may be fixable, or may be inherent in the game. Hearts of Iron definitely has a problem with what it tries to do as a game when compared to other titles in Paradox's lineup. In many ways its the same Paradox sandbox a la Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis its except set in the WW II era and all its flaws that could be conveniently be swept under the rug with those titles due to the subject material can't be ignored and swept away in Hearts of Iron. The first issue is that the AI does in fact suck. It sucks a lot and can't do what I consider fundamental basics to the point that as a total noob after I figured out the interface, I dominated Japan as China in what was historically one of the worst matchups. Not that this is different than any other Paradox game but those other games had a cool safety outlet that could yet you suspend your disbelief. CK 2 has a pretty terrible AI but with enough random ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t thrown at you like succession wars, random invaders, stupid heirs etc, it had enough jazz to keep you on your toes. A true expert can still wreck the entire game but it wasn't nearly as easy as in Hearts of Iron where a literal noob wiped the floor first with Japan and then the Soviet Union on regular difficulty.Part of this is because Paradox has made what I felt was a reasonably detailed combat/production/logistics system that fit perfectly with what a grand strategy game should be. Enough nuts and bolts to "simulate" historical flavor but not at all overwhelming to learn or to turn the player into an accountant instead of trying to paint the map with the color of this flag. The downside of this is that you need an AI that plays the game well and it doesn't. I have seen it myself and through reading various forums its pretty obvious that the AI can't research properly, can't design proper divisions that are remotely competitive to what players even in their first few outings will immediately start making, it cannot make proper decisions as to where to take ground, and cannot make non terrible decisions regarding division allocations in even single front wars, let alone multi front wars. Hell it can't even use land bridges properly.This issue may be somewhat fixable but I have my doubts. Gort posted a reddit post early where someone had tinkered with research values and at least got the AI to research tanks and planes past 1940s design and that is a good first step. I can see maybe the AI making divisions more intelligently but a lot of it is contextual and based on a myriad of limiting factors like type of natural resources available, manpower available vis a vis its wartime opponent, the type of terrain that it is likely to be deployed to in the near future, and even whether it can strike the proper balance of how "cheap" to make its units with regards to the amount of anticipated frontage it will have to deal with.This of course didn't exist in CK2 and EU4 (well it did but what they were modeling in that game was far more forgiving) where all you really had to do was assemble your army, march it towards the enemy and hopefully crush the opposing army and sue for peace for your war goal. The AI could do that. You could of course game the system but as long as you weren't outright doing things to knowingly mess with the AI, it would perform at an acceptable level. In Hearts of Iron, you could be in the dark about half the game mechanics like I was and the AI would still not be acceptable.The other issue is sort of AI related but more in the realm of suspension of disbelief. We all know this is a game but it is still set in a historical setting so it would be nice if the game played out with some historical guidelines. To be clear this is not about railroading results or countries into historical actions. That would defeat the purpose of a title like Hearts of Iron. What I am talking about are things like 800 US divisions by 1950. No that did not happen, it did not come close to happening and its very jarring to see. I am by no means a grognard but even I know the US didn't come close to fielding 800 divisions, more like 100. I know myself that those divisions are all small, crappy and can't do a thing but when I zoom out and see 800 divisions, it throws me off.Similarly, nations allied to each other didn't just throw troops at front lines willy nilly. They had assigned commands and had responsibilities and generally grouped together by nation and assigned certain areas of the front line. So it is also kind of jarring and annoying to see allied divisions in China just randomly spread out across my front line, especially when they are eating into my supply while I am desperately building infrastructure and I can't tell them to ♥♥♥♥ off or assign them a place to go. Instead, I have a UN rainbow of divisions spread out every where that is not useful at doing anything and is certainly not helpful. This one could be fairly easy to solve using the Expeditionary Forces function and if some intelligent way could be made to provide each area with a primary controller and each country can only send forces there using the expeditionary forces style command.Almost all of these complaints go out the window with multiplayer, I totally get it. But I play paradox sandbox games because I enjoy playing at my own pace without holding people up. Overall by no means a terrible game but I don't see this game's trajectory being nearly as good as something like CK or EU just given the nature of the subject material.
The Schwam	Not Recommended	641.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003348648/	I've enjoyed playing this game, especially the KR mod, but it's obvious that Paradox is going to just keep pumping out half finished DLC instead of actually finishing basic features that have been missing since release. This game still has no event log. This game still has only the most barebones espionage system. I'd say wait for them to finish the game before buying, but it's more likely you'll be seeing Hoi 5 before then.

Yes, I understand, this is their right to do this, but the absurdity of releasing a buggy product with a multitude of gameplay issues, and then locking new and interesting content away from the playerbase behind a paywall, I can't help but imagine Paradox as being a money-hungry, greedy company.I enjoy the base game, but I do not support Paradox.

Curs3	Not Recommended	842.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sys0p/	400+ hours. I love the game, I really do. I see the potential in it. However the AI is glaring with problems. The ai loves to have thousands of different generals for 1 or 2 divisions. The Ai also can't seem to prioritize. China will be on the verge of being taken over by Japan, but still think having troops on the mongolian boarder is important. Now since the recent patches, the Japanese ai seems to be broken. It refuses to do naval invasions like before. I don't understand it. This game would be a blast with a lan party, but good luck trying to get 5+ people to play for hours. Wouldn't be so bad, but playing on the internet has its own share of problems. So if you can't play online.. and the ai sucks.. how are you suppose to enjoy this game?

What the DLC does add is flavour to nations and quality of life improvements, the former has been done already by the modders in some form, and the latter doesn't actually add anything to the game other than a work-around for the more unwieldy aspects of this game. Lost potential. I recommend you buy HOI3, the previous iteration. Still unwieldy, but adds a lot more aspects to the game and somehow has better AI. If you do pick it up in a sale, then do subscribe to the "Kaisereich" mod in the workshop. Adds more value than picking up the DLCs.

Ludendorff	Not Recommended	210.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030893129/	This game is not finished, and is currently, so long after release, UNPLAYABLE. At least if you fancy any sort of realism to your WW2 games.After patch 1.3, the AI is still not making any reasonable decisions.German AI declares war (DOWs) on Poland and struggles to take it. It then DOWs the Low Countries and does not attack them. It may take Poland or may continue to struggle, and then decides to DOW Denmark and Norway. All this can happen before november 39. So germany fights on at least 3 fronts at the same time.I have yet to see, with all the hours I played the game (mainly watching, not really playing), the German AI perform a single naval invasion on Norway, despite it always DOWing Norway. Oslo seems like the safest place to be in the whole war. Copenhagen too, it is not always captured. I have seen Denmark attacking into northern Germany instead.The finns can capture an unguarded Leningrad, while the russians attack through western Finland...The UK goes crazy and launches naval invasions in Italy, which is undefended, because all the italian troops are on the french border, or are sent to fight in the Netherlands, while the french are invading Milan. Rome usually falls in april-june 1940. The game is not playable in its current state, and the responses from Paradox have been close to rude. They claim the AI cant be "fixed", it can only be "improved". So it's a question of semantics for them.They got one, I say one (1) guy working on the AI, and clearly he is not able. So the game is a disaster. And all the while this tragey unfolds they push out DLC with content that should have been in the game already, like the "spearhead" (blitz) tactic. Or rather, the game should not have been released at all, because it isnt functional.I would suggest any hardcore WW2 fan go check out the games published by Matrix games and/or Slytherin instead.I would like to get my money back, but I have "played" too many hours. Haven't enjoyed it though.

I've stuck around because they were basically the only doing what they did and they supported games for a long time. For a small developer this meant DLCs, which is fine!But seeing as this is now a publically traded company who managed to launch 2 big games at once it's starting to not be cute anymore.A year after release of HOI4 there really is no indication they are going to significantly improve matters with their DLCs. The DLCs so far have been a few focus trees and maybe 1 or 2 features that should never have been behind a pay wall.I've lost confidence in Paradox in this, especially because their Dev Reports are amazingly Tone Deaf on this issue. They'll say "We've listened to the customer! The customer wanted 4 focus trees for 10 euros!". What?

StandardCapital	Not Recommended	530.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/standardcapital/	HOI4 is a good game though some aspects of it are annoying.For example, as much as I hate to say it the ai is terrible, it is har to lose a war in a game of single for an atleast somewhat expirienced player, even in Ironman at the hardest difficulty it is still easy and besides from the AI being bad it's almost as if for large countries, for example Germany, you can just draw a frontline and don't have to micro manage at all which does not take any skill.Though something I do enjoy is the workshop for HOI4, there are a lot of great mods that you can have fun with and that are really well made, an example would be the kaiserreich mod.For now I would say it is better to go with another Paradox game such as EUIV or Crusader Kings 2, though in the future if most things are fixed I would recommend buying it.

For the casual player or new-entry to the Hearts of Iron series this is a great game -> despite it having quite a few...mind boggling issues most noteably the AI. From the perspective of a HoI III fan - what I am - I can only say that this game is so casualized its barely playable. The Ai is horrible(cant tech, declares war on everyone,..+) , units dont consume fuel but "supplies", you can not stockpile resources for war and if you are lacking resources you produce with a big malus (combined with no stockpiles you are somewhat boned) - trade is so much simplified its non existant - diplomacy is in the game but no one gives a damn. A historical WW2 is non existant cause the game has so many sandboxy concept in it that even romania can conquer Germany etc....If you really want the game, buy it. If you "would like to have it" but it at x-mas sale, chances are it resembles something playbe by then. For everyone else just "interested" in it wait until some more patches or even DLCs are released..

Wave	Not Recommended	225.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Torsimus/	Well.. I have now drinked beer for 8 hours all together. That's about the most exiting and compelling feature of this game.As a HoI3 veteran (not a world conqueror pro though) this game feels like the game itself is missing. The player handles research (which is boring and simplified from HoI3) and production but the actual fighting is done by the absolutely garbage Paradox style AI. You draw a line on the map, see random numbers which indicate how much penalties (or sometimes bonuses) you get for your battle plan and then you press a button and get your a$$ kicked. Your units come and go and do some fighting now and then if you ask them, but in the end they're suicidal idiots at best. At worst, it's the reason to quit playing and write a bitter review.The best thing about the battle planning phase is that once the battle starts the AI messes up the plan and you get -100% effectiveness penalty. This has applied to every test play and every battle I've had with 6 different nations I've tested (which do not include Germany or Soviets).The only word to describe the UI is awful.If I want to assign my planes to do something or even see them doing whatever, I have to click the continent I'm sending them in, not the planes or the airfield. Makes a whole lot of sense, eh?Everything seems to be really really messy but still you don't have any useful information or tools anywhere. Finding the right window to do things is a pain and clicking anywhere pops up another window so you're constantly closing unnecessary windows that you never wanted to open in the first place.All in all I haven't been able to really enjoy the game yet. I believe that the stockholm syndrome will hit eventually (around 50 hours, like it did with EU4) and I'll be able to tolerate it but every time I quit playing I'm glad I did so.The good things?Being able to change your government, going for communist or fascist USA for example, is the thing that I always wanted to have in HoI3 and I really love the sandbox aspect of the game. You can create new factions which is great, especially for multiplayer and some parts of this game are well tought and funny.The sad thing is, it doesn't really matter are you democratic, communist or fascist USA if the actual warfare is as pleasant as eating glass.

ALSO if you dont have over 100 hours you shouldnt be reviewing a game that takes hundreds of hours to learn.  Now that I've made the sad HOI3♥♥♥♥♥♥♥my ♥♥♥♥♥ i will actually write my review.  I run a youtube channel called Balls Of Iron and honestly this game is a great game to buy.... there are quirks but thats with every game.  the base game is very playble and for 40 bucks its worth it.  If you dont masturbate all day and have a few online friends then youll know you dont need top buy DLCs... all you need is a dumb♥♥♥♥♥♥friend that has all the DLCs and you dont need to spend a dime (well besides the 40 bucks).  The game mechanics and the UI are much better than HOI3 and this game is very good for players new to paradox and for those who wanna play a game that uses actual brian power.  Stick with the game and you'll learn it. ALSO if you want a tutorial ive got some on my channel. :P
Cimmaron	Not Recommended	278.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cimmaron/	Paradox, I love Hearts of Iron 2, I love Darkest Hour. I never got into HoI3, but okay. EUIV and Cities: Skylines made me love you guys and be big cheerleaders for you. HoI4 was going to be great, and it's been a lot of fun to play so far. But then the price hikes and the overpriced DLC that barely add anything feels like a stab in the back. We trusted you, Paradox. And this is what we get in return? Nickel and diming to make a few extra bucks? Eitherway, waiting until HUGE discounts before I even consider buying the DLC, even if that's two or three years away.
happy	Not Recommended	422.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052884890/	this game is pretty much a wargame engine(with incomptetent AI) dressed up for binge drinking at the Rio de Janeiro carnival.it looks really good for a wargame, and more important you can play it even when you havent understood 40% of how it works, you ll have fun, and you ll win if you ve picked a decent size nation.but that's a bit short, somewhere down the line paradox studio forgot its consumers were used to deep games.i had a lot of fun during the time i thought i was a tactical genius, i now have no fun because i know its not me, its the AIs downsyndrom that makes me shine.in shortGOOD:-easy to get into(for a wargame); if you havent been on the brink for a while, go ahead, HOI4 is THE introduction to wargames.-it looks good-mostly intelligent UI, mostly(ships/planes are totally counter intuitive)-flatters your ego, a lot. Win WWII alone as France, no allies, on your second try.-mods-BAD:-its a joke of a wargame(it does have nice fiddly mechanics you can enjoy max minimising, but behaving like a berserk brick works just as well.)-supply. Though i get it they wanted to make it simple, not sure to totally abstract(if not overlook) that aspect is a good idea. Worth a try, sadly kinda failed.-tech/research: you just click on a new one when the current one is done. Oddly in this game research is not something that will enhance your game, its something that takes numerous steps, and you have to climb each step one by one to...do the thing you ve already decided to do from the first day of 1936.its...QTE research!!!ok theres no real QTE of course but it does feel like QTEs in the way that it feels artificial and implemented just to give the player something to do during peace time.-AI. Lots of people complain about that: concretly the AI is not a lunatic, but its a very very near sighted 89 year old WWI french general that falls into every lousy trap you improvise.(ex: first game i play i have all of italy invade southern france, in two weeks in managed to anihilate 134 divisions by cutting off their supplies.It was my first game, i of course played poorly, yet i succeeded) HOI4 is an Arcade wargame, maybe even a good one.it s well made, it s short, it looks good, its fun.but it stops here.this review is probably a negative one, it may change if the game gets better with time.its still a paradox game with all its qualities but this time they really cut it to bare minimals, and i wanted/expected more.i would have probably given a thumbs up if it had just one bad point less, or if it werent the shortest life paradox game released so far.EDIT, after 200hrs, i sadly do not change my review, it's gotten worse, even mods, as ambitious as some are, fail to deliver because of rigid mechanics(or worse...placeholder mechanics)HOI4 is a love affair gone really bad: i now loath the game.do not buy it unless you are under 13 years old.

Powell	Not Recommended	817.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheHoenir/	A massive downgrade from HOI 3 as they stripped out so many features for no clear reason expect to sell to the masses by simplifying it, so people won’t be intimidated by it. When I first started playing it I was really excited as I watched all of the dev diaries and read some reviews which made it to look like it was a step forward, but it actually was 20 steps in the wrong direction for the HOI series.If you didn't play HOI 3 you would most likely love this game to bits as you won't miss the air supply, spies, the depth of the technology tree, convoy system and etc. If you did play HOI 3 you will be disappointed.These features are most likely going to be added either by a s*** ton of dlc’s or by mods. Either way I wouldn’t recommend this game at the current time.

At first it had me, it really looked amazing, i admired the UI and everything felt.. pleasing, if thats one way of putting it. But then i started playing it, and i tried staying in as much as i could, but the fact is i got bored withing 5 hours. 5.. hours..come one... where is the intricate micro managing of units, supplies just whiz through the air everywhere, supplies... resources... Uhgg..Look the game is excellent for itself, and for anyone looking for a simple Hearts of Iron/ large term world strategy game, but after playing hearts of iron 3 on my friends machine and supreme ruler ultimate on mine, please forgive me, but i'm already being bombed by boredom while watching 3 full strengthed armies, not go around the maginot line like i ordered, but no, we HAVE to go through it. German honor or some such business there. Needless to say i think the AI is a bit.. cooked in the head.. But only sometimes. At others im impressed by countries doing their thing and being very versatile.I'm not going to rate this game badly, because it is very, very well done, unfortunately, it's just not something that i personally will enjoy or get the number of hours i consider worth paying for out of it.
cdenny	Not Recommended	742.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011415519/	There are lots of things about this game that I like. The division designer is a lot of fun and allows for a great flexibility in play style. The production system is excellent and has more to do with my constantly coming back to the game than anything else.There are as many, if not more, elements which I find quite disappointing but which I recognise may not matter to others as much. The loss of anything resembling the Order of Battle system in HoI3 and the bizarre decision to abandon province names - a staple of all paradox games - makes it hard for me to feel invested in what goes on or build stories around my games.However, the reason I would strongly urge people against buying Hearts of Iron 4 is that the game AI is so weak, even after a year, that I don't think this game could be reasonably said to be out of beta. An AI will never be as good as a human player at managing armies but in this game it regularly drops far below any acceptable level. Because of the national focus system AI countries will regularly start wars without checking to see if it even has any divisions near the target country or it's allies. The most frustrating part of this is that it does not become obvious until you have played several hours focusing on the very satisfactory internal stuff like production and division design. Then suddenly you'll find that all of that was wasted time because Russia started a war with Romania while it's army was in Siberia or China hasn't trained a single division since 1936.You're options at that point are to play through when all you need to do is tell your army to march uncontested to the enemy victory points or quit and start again hoping against hope that this time something like that won't happen again.If they couldn't fix it in a year I see no reason to believe they'll fix it any time this side of Hearts of Iron V.

Rendition	Recommended	190.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008073773/	Best war game ever, even better than Distant Worlds: Universe (but barely). Most war games are simple over-glorified resource management simulators. They require lots of micromanaging, and victory is usually measured in clicks-per-minute. The strategies hardly resemble anything in the real world.HoI4 is the best done war game that includes realistic aspects of actual warfare, such as a supply chain, limited manpower, and dealing with resistance in occupied territories. You also learn a lot about WWII, why it happened the way it did, and how it could have ended differently. And, it gives you a better perspective on real world conflicts today.They made HoI4 more gamey than their HoI3, and not everything is accurate unfortunately. I hope they move towards more accuracy in future games. However, the Battle Planning feature is indispensable. I would rather play HoI4 over HoI3 just because it practically eliminates micromanaging altogether.

Itsumi Erika	Recommended	1,340.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsumierika/	I could say a lot of things about this game. I remember back when I eagerly awaited coming from Hoi3, and while I recieved Hoi3 from a friend, this I bought with my own money. There is a lot of things you could say about this game, and honestly at first I was fairly disappointed with the outcome of the game. However as time slowly progressed I began to grow more fond of the game, and fairly enjoyed playing it. Mods of course helped my experience along the way, but the game is met for you to forge your countries fate in the dreadful time that the Second World War is. However, Paradox lacks to make it fun to morph the country you choose into something you can really be proud of. Like, oh boy, I can go Fascist, Communist, Democratic, or god forbid, Neutral. I can build infastructure and factories in my states, and landforts, to defend from the Russians or Germans or whoever it is  you go into fighting. Now however the war is the fun part of the game, and even that can tend to be boring sometimes. I mean, I can garuntee you that at least 500 of my hours in this game are as Romania, which is my favorite in game country and irl. I was disappointed to see though that Paradox left out some very key things to Romanian history, even when the Death or Dishonor DLC came out. Such as the Iron Guard, it isn't led by Ion Antonescu, he came after the founder, Corneliu Z. Codreanu was assassinated while being jailed. These are of course minor things that do not affect the game, but it is something that annoys me. Luckily the great people in the Workshop will sort most of your problems out. Putting this all together, I can say while I do enjoy the game very much, and its fun to play, especially with friends, I must give it a 7/10. Due to the Historical inaccuracies and limited amount of things to do in peacetime rather then pick a focus and do your research. If you like strategy games I think you'd love this game. Sadly though I think Paradox should put more work into the peacetime economics of this fun game.
P90RUL0R	Not Recommended	84.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197970352902/	The game is simply broken (technically) and won't work on any up-to-date machine with AMD graphics cards. If your game freezes on "Updating History" (single player) or upon clicking on a country (multiplayer selection screen) you're out of luck. The developer seriously suggests to revert to an old GPU driver and claims to be unable to fix this issue, insinuating that others are at fault. I have no idea how they explain that all other games work fine and why they would even consider recommending outdated software, but I can only assume that they don't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥and are too incompetent/too lazy to actually do something, hence the bs explanation/excuse.If the magnificent Clausewitz Engine doesn't work, it must be someone else who ♥♥♥♥ed up of course....

chrisbergy	Not Recommended	823.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012070686/	After having invested quite a few hours in this game, I feel that I have a good take on it.  I was so excited for it that, at first, i generally liked it but alas it is seriously flawed.  Now I play as axis and mostly Italy.  I watched many videos on it and found Taureor's strategy makes it winnable.  However it feels like an exploit and is strictly land based.  Without it you are dependant on Germany.  Ther in lies a problem.  Every, and I mean every time I play as Italy or Japan, Germany declares war on the world and dies a quick death.  I mean it can't even take France.  Now you have invested 3 hours in prepping for WWII only to have Germany suck.  One time I dragged Germany to 1941, I conquered France and North Africa.  Then got in a rediculously repetative, game of micromanagement.  France, without the benefit of industry sent metric tons of divisions (along with GB). Through Cental Africa.  LOL even the US sending volunteer Divisions landed 1 in Jerusalem of all places.  Squarely in the middle of my occupied territory, with no enemy border, no airfield within range and the Med closed.  It appeared there out of supply and quickly died, but come on really?The UI is good....and bad.  Managing industry and production is great, but forget about splitting up a large navy into smaller ones it is 45 mins to an hour.  Supply, resource management, and diplomacy is straight forward.  Focus tree is ok except when a country no longer exists and still carries out a focus.  Or conquering say Austria and 3 monts later have Germany, your ally, Anschluss it from you.AI AI AI really blows. The afore mentioned suicidal Germany, delares war on Poland (France and UK declare)...ok I'm in; then in succesion,  Benelux countries (understandable), then Denamrk (uhm uh oh!), then Norway, Sweden and USSR (ok uhm....NO way to win).  Germany slows down there as there are no other counttries to declare.The Arrow battle plans are a waste of time.  Troops stand around, ignore decidely favourable attacks and while advancing a bit generally spend most of the time sending divisions from one end of the line to another.  As the afore mentioned example in Africa, if you give a a battle plan the troopa absolutely will not move without micromanagement.  That while comp AI moves them all well right across the Sahara....i mean really?However there is room for growth here and Paradox is behind it.  It feels unfinished and honestly not as good IMHO as HOI3, at this point in time.Pros:Diplomacy is okNational Focus....nice bit of the countries flavorSupply is straight forward and understandableDevision Design is goodFactory, infrastructure and resources undestandableI like factories as currencyUI is good in some areasCons:Air combat is very abstract...i find it meh doableI dont lie DOWing a country and have them on the ropes and then they join the Allies.National focus for deceased countries lolWould be nice for countries to have idependant research trees.Being able to march troops though central Africa through Sahara.  The Sahara should be as it is.....impassableAIAIAI....makes the game a FAIL!This is just my opinion as i have read many favourable reviews here, and innitially I like it as well.

While the inherent complexities off a game modelling World War Two (WW2) at a division/ship/aircraft level mean that there are still elements of the game that could benefit from further polish, the game in its current state is a lot of fun and a genuine strategic challenge as long as one is either playing multiplayer or not taking advantage of exploits that the AI can't match (and, of course, playing a nation like France or Italy will be more of a challenge than playing one like the US, USSR or Germany - but that should expected (and desired) in a WW2 grand strategy game.As with all 'core' Paradox Development Studio games, there is a team continually working to both improve the base game and develop DLC, which promises great things for the future.  The game is also well supported by modders, with both active WW1 and Modern Day mods in development, as well as alt-history favourites like KaisserReich.

dwolf357	Not Recommended	141.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009283538/	HOI4 was a game I had been looking forward to for some time. When the release was pushed back for "balancing issues" I was dissapointed but also rejoicing that a company had the integrity to acknowledge the need to correct issues. Having played it, I'm left wondering what they fixed. The AI is horrible. Amphibious attacks with 3 divisions? Allies unable to hold territory, God forbid you expect them to launch legitimate offensives. And the trade issue. Please explain why Germany would ever trade away excess oil and rubber...for the sake of sanity why can the player not control where resources are being traded to?The graphics are beautiful and the mechanics for ground combat seem to be there. As for Naval and air I'm uncertain but it might be OK as well.The game doesn't deserve the high ratings.  I understand Paradox is usually good about patching and fixing problems, they have started with Stellaris issues and hopefully HOI4 is soon to see some much needed repairs.
Mine eyes have seen the glory	Recommended	1,462.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198242076676/	I think I'm addicted to this game.The game is great in vannila,but where it really shines is the abundance of mods.I like the template system,puppet system,the glorious mods like Kaiserreich,the new decision system(looks solid but I didn't have the pleasure of playing it yet),solid focus trees and I like how every nation has the potential to conquer the world exept for you know albania or idk the thunder dragon empire,dont even get me started on the music.

shamneo	Not Recommended	124.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070810590/	After over 100 hours of gameplay, I think it's a good time to write a review. Basically, love the game but not recommended. I am a big fan of huge strategy games and Paradox makes the best of them. Huge hours put into EU4 and CK2. But there's just one thing missing with one. Not replayable! That's my main problem. I love the combat. I love the management side. But after playing all the major factions, There's just really nothing to do after that. It's based on WW2. Yes. But that's it. You can play the bad guy as Germany and win it or be the good guy. You can change history as you like. I even played as Iran and be with the Axis. And that gameplay was sooo boring. You start weak, and you still remain weak by the end of it. The problem is the it's too much based on history. You can be a weak country but by the time you get strong, the war would've been decided already. Country options is a problem.. You can't play as the asian countries since, most of them are already under control by a bigger nation. After 100 hours of it, I just got bored. I found myself buying CK2 complete pack on steam sal e and played that instead. THE GAME IS GOOD BUT NOT RECOMMENDED.

Holm	Recommended	190.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961547690/	This is my first review i have ever done and i felt like doing it because this game gave me something extraordinary. Me(23 years old) and my dad who's 52 have always liked games. But for alot of the later years we simply did not play the same games. Probably because of taste. We did however, like strategy games both of us and have played alot of civilization together back in the times.Now i fell over this game and i actually brought the game for both me and my dad so we could give it a go, for good old times sake. Little did i know what i got us into. Together we figured out how the game work, step by step and getting stomped by the merciless AI's in every way possible for the first couple of hours. Please make a proper toturial for us casual people:(.  but nontheless we learned the basic of the game.  After 50 hours of insane amount of fun together with my father, which included long discussions of strategies, victories and defeats. Hell, we have even been sitting at the dinner table talking about in what ways we could bring down the russian bear. Thank you for creating this amazing game and i would anytime recommend it for someone who got a friend og close relation to play it with. There's nothing bringing people together like taking over Europe. 10/10 would have my father as Hitler again.

Felix Nix	Recommended	615.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993698111/	This is a bit hard to reccomend. The AI is a bit dumb, and will regularly leave it's front undefended, and when fighting alongside you, will never move thier units into a coherent fighting force. I played France in my own alliance, and after wiping Germany and the rest of the Axis, we warred with the Soviets, with America joining in. America kept most of it's units off the front, forcing my military to bear the brunt of a full soviet assault, which was very taxing on my manpower. Eventually won, but I'll be damned if America didn't have 10x my unit count, with most of them in my territory, and only about 10 divisions on the front. On the other hand, I find it fun. It's fun designing units, and devising strategies, and picking the right time to strike, and the right things to build at the right time. That aside, Paradox has been very poor in it's decision making for the DLCs. The most recent, death or dishonor, honestly should've been a patch. They do the same thing for Stellaris, where MAJOR GAME CHANGES are kept behind a paywall. But, if Paradox pulls it's head out of it's butt, like many companies are doing slowly, than this may be one of the best grand strategy games ever. So I do recomend.  Just expect to pay about $70 for the final product.EDIT: The cornflakes free update has fixed many of the AI problems that where present. it still isn't the best at making intelligent decisions (such as communist China going to war with China AND Manchukuo after Japan had a civil war and went democratic), but it can at least wage war now. Front lines shift realistically, units get cut off, and will attempt to re-establish supply lines, and when backed into a corner, the AI won't just stuff 100 undersupllied units into 5 districts to try to keep it.
Pototron	Not Recommended	240.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197966835726/	Unfortunately, as much as i like this game......and will continue to play it. I have to warn people that as of right now the game is broken in many fashion. Altought it may not appear to more ''casual'' eyes, the AI in the game is uterly flawed. Picking any nation in the world and steamrolling anyone is very easy. The AI is totally.....and i really mean TOTALLY clueless about what to do.  I will change this for sure if they fix this zombie AI and i really hope they do.Some examples. -If you are playing germany, dont expect the AI to attack mainland Europe. It just cant make any sort of worthwhile naval invasion.-The AI of EVERY nations feel compelled to send almost all their army in expeditionary forces across the world to fight useless war. Its very common to have millions of soldiers, whole armies, fighting for nothing in the sahara or in the Himalayas...and of course all the while they lack supplies and thousand die just because the AI dont care about supply. -While the army of everyone is sailing uselessly accross the world for nothing they never escort their transport ship. Again the AI loose soldier and equipment.....for nothing.(The italian have a BAD habit of sending almost his whole army to north germany, embark in (aparently teleporting...or more realistically folded) boats, sail through the english channel, while the english kill them in drove of course. Then go all around africa to reach the utmost important and strategic country of ethiopia. EVERY GAME- The AI is totally unable to use the army experience/template systems. This only weakens him even more as it cant field any kind of good units(template).  also wasting precious experience points in dozens of template it wil NEVER recruit. - The AI is unable to decide what to attack, defend or ignore. You can see germany conquering the russian and fighting well beyond moscow, all while the britsh and the USA will conquer europe without any resistance. Or the italian fighting desperatly for every inch of the precious sahara desert. While Italy is being invaded, they wont send any army to defend themselves.- Its so funny. In one of my games the USSR invaded romania early, before I (as germany invaded france). Then instanly after Romania joined the allies. The war was of course won by Russia and romania became communist. But it didnt ended there the war now was beetween the Allies and the commintern. So the war migrated to the only border beetween the two. North india, it was so ridiculous every allies nation sended whole army to fight litterally in the himalayas...well almost XD, and of course with no supply every one lost tons of soldier. And before it even began the war was already won by the Axis(me). This suicide for what......romania...wich didnt even existed anymore at this point....so you see its kind of broken.To me what is even more frustrating is that all these glaring and big problems passed the testing phase. Its shameful. Almost Rome 2 shameful..........
Katarina	Recommended	1,752.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039251760/	Now that i have reached 100 hours in Hoi4 i think its time to set right what so many steam "reviewers" and mainly QQers have done wrong.So, join me in this journey as i go through everything the game is offering and taking it apart, giving you an actual idea of what the game is about instead of reading a review of ppl with about 20 to 10 hrs gametime or less - because in this game it actually makes a difference.Disclaimers:0.) Havent done the tutorial since i come from Hoi3 and didnt think i needed it. Was right, but i hear its not really helpful for newbies tho :/0.1) very hard for me to stay in the review corner and not turn this into a guide, so if you feel this explains too much, let me know.Table of Contents:1.) UI, its what you usually see first when you launch your first match, pros and cons.2.) National politics tab, where you set Bonuses to your Nation, and go down the focus tree.3.) Research, obviously where you get Nukes and V2´s.4.) Diplomacy, or Public relations as i like to call it.5.) Trading, yeah have fun with that as germany -.-6.) Construction, not to confuse with production, here you build factories, AAA, costal defences, and all the juicy stuff your provinces could ever need, even recources ;P7.) Production, not to confuse for Construction, here you build tanks, aircraft, ships and infantry equipment. Everything a soldier could wish for.8.) Recruting, this is where you actually train and deploy new units.9.) Logistics, overview of what you have, need and produce.10.) Gameplay, here i will talk about the actual gameplay and stuff that happens on the map.12.) Overall Impression, final thoughts.UI: This is a combination of mixed feelings for me, because it throws new ppl into the cold water. Once you get your head around it, it is very intuitive and easy to understand and follow the developers logic with how and why they went with this. Tho i have to admit, my con in this is that the switching between the mapmodes in the bottom right corner (recources, resistance, supplies etc.) is a little bit enraging since the buttons are so genuisly tiny that you tend to hit the screens edge and end up in japan when youre fighting in the north see before you selected the supply mode. But i heard they are going to adress that in future patches (The way we know Paradox theyre likely to laugh diabolicly at that kind of misfortune as well...).National Politics:This is where you spend your political power on in the first 2 years of any game, you equip your nation with all sorts of bonuses by setting politicians or laws that reach into every aspect of the game, even combat. For me, this was one of the easier features to understand and it is indeed very straight forward and self explanatory.As well as that, you set national focuses wich bring you on the path to war and greater power, for the most part. Depending on your nation - Superpowers like russia USA, UK or germany get a specific one for themselves while minors like Spain, Nepal or Luxembourg have to share the same one - you have different objectives that you can choose to go for. For germany that would obviously be the annexation of austria and the chech part of chechoslovakia, or in the Russian tree you have a lot of "SEND PEEPOL TO GULAG!"Research:Now we come to a little bit more juicy stuff. When it comes to research you get a metric button of choices at the start of a game and during earlygame, a lot of catching up during midgame, and a mixture of "so what the ♥♥♥♥ am i going to do with myself now" and "YAY" when you finished all your tech trees in late and endgame.Overall the techs explain themselves very well and are for the time they are set in EXCLUDING THE MODERN TANKS (E-50, Challanger & Co.) very well placed. By wich i mean it all makes sense. But you reach lategame tanks to quickly. In 60% of my matches as germany i could skip Panthers and Panzer 4´s and go straight for the E-50. Wich is brilliant btw.Diplomacy: Ahhh yes, the most useless thing in any hearts of Iron game because your Hitlerin and Blitzkriegin your way to World dominance anyway and you know you will :DIm kidding... now with Hoi4 you can actually do stuff with it!  Make USA into Nazi country and call themselves "Free American Reich"? CHECK! Make france turn communist, leave the allies and join up with Russia in comintern? CHECK!Wanna do cool stuff like that? Well here is where.Also i like how war declerations are performed now, gives it a little more strategic and realistic feeling to have public denounciation of *coughdenmark* uhm i mean various countries going on before stepping on them *cough* it.Trading: Now, here are the biggest strengths and weaknesses of nations coming together. Germany´s lack of everthing, Uk´s Overflow in everything but steel. USA´s ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amounts of Oil. This tab, including all the recources that the game has (i know this is not a guide but i think for ppl that want to buy the game by any chance would be helped if they knew this); Oil, Rubber, Tungsten, Steel, Aluminium and Chromium; is very well designed and intertwined with the rest of the game in my opinion. So far i couldnt find anything bad about it.Construction: Here, we start to get a little more strategic, Youll need Civillian factories to repair bomb, combat and resistance fighter damage, and to build new stuff like more factories, more factories or more factories. (In a way this is me both actually telling the truth and joking at the same time) I have to be honest with you, you could go for nothing but factories but if you did that you wouldnt be very happy, yes a good amount of factories - military or civillian - is indeed neccessary but you need other stuff as well, your provincal anti air guns will be useless if you dont build radar and research good encryption, your trooops will run out of supplies when you fight without infrastructure in russia, etc. All that sort of stuff needs to be sorted or you will make it more difficult on yourself.Production: I really dont know what to to this. Whenever i meet someone new to Hoi4 and they run into Production, theyre always like, HELP!!!!!!!And then it takes me 2 Minutes or less to explain what it what and they theyre saying, ah okay this is actually pretty easy... Important to note here is that all the equipment you produce gets AUTOMATICLY transfered into eighter your divisions on the field, or if they are all fully equipped into storage. Production is 100% passive and in the background, if you produce everything you need then there is nothing you have to worry about from there on out. If Equipment is still missing build more. The Logistics tab helps a lot with that but were not quite there.There is one little thing that i have to ad for a personal con, and thats when you open up the list of things you can open up a new line with, there should be an option for every vehicle to be turned off and on again so you dont have to see them. Because the longer a match gets, the more of a scrollfest it becomes. very annoing. Recruiting:Now here is where ppl get lost easily, because you dont only tell the game to recruit whats there, you also have to look at your division templates and change them to your needs. And you HAVE to do that. You can not expect to win against france if one of your division has 5k men full strength. All in all i am pleased with how Paradox set this up, it is all very logical and easy once you understood it. Getting there is mostly the issue but when you buy a paradox game you sign up for this.I will now have to stop because im running out of letters..............  NOT AMUSEDWell i guess you get the point i love the game and everyone should. Goodbuy!
Whiteswart	Recommended	1,892.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/	The newest addition to the Hearts of Iron series is the most user-friendly (almost as the Civilization 5) and war-mongering as always. Just like so many other Paradox global strategies, you take control of the one particular state (which can be as big as Soviet Union/USA or as small as Luxemburg). You're making calls with industry, technologies and infernal politics, preparing for the grand war, which is so close. And then you must fight. Even if you choose some state on the outskirts of the world, like New Zealand or Haiti - it doesn't mean you'll evade the global skirmish. You'll be bored all the way - but eventually, the war will come to you as well.I have an ambivalent opinion of HoI 4 and don't recommend it as an instant buy. Maybe Paradox will patch some questionable features sometimes... But maybe they'll just make the next, better game. Or they'll make the next HoI even worse, who knows? Yeah, sure, it developed a lot in little details since the 1.0 up to 1.4 version, I can easily agree with that. But, some things, are not too right in the very basic concept.The most noticeable pro point of the 4th volume (above the 3rd HoI) is an aeons more acceptable interface and tutorial. The game's mechanics are still very complicated, but, at least, you can learn it without your head boiling too hot. However, there is a catch: once you'll learn "the better way" for every country, it's really not fun to play it again. The limit of replayability is still quite high - but it's countable. It's good for game sellers, so they can sell the next almost-similar game faster (the Call-of-Duty syndrome). But it certainly lowers the overall score of the one particular game for me.What is worse, while basically, every country has at least 3 different ways to go, Democratic, Socialistic or Fascist, it's obvious that for the most cases, the Fascist way benefits the player much more. "C'mon, game, make me a Fascist! Faster!" - that's a common phrase among Youtube letsplayers. Some may argue, like, would Paradox make it another way - the Axis would be loosing way too often. Maybe. But look at the achievements. There is one, "NewWorldOrder", make all the world brown, but why there aren't such trophies for Blue and Red sides? Well, it's not a secret that the dev's are favouring Hitler - maybe not as a person, but as a political figure... But, even in the 3rd Hearts of Iron, where Adolf get a cameo in so-called "tutorial", it wasn't so one-way oriented.Turning fascist as a key strategy to win the war is only one minus point. The much more severe case is all diplomatics in general. First, there are political blocks. And if you're, say, choosing Allies, you can't then skip to the Comintern or Axis during the war. And even if both Allies and Comintern are fighting Axis together, like as in known history, they are still not counting as allies between each other. Next, even worse, is about running some of those blocks yourself. Example - an achievement for Mexico, to land onto Europe, either not allied with anybody, or having the alliance only with South America countries. For Mexico, it's crucial to make at least small alliance - without it, you can't open the 5th research slot, therefore, you'll be losing the tech race. So I made a fine alliance with Colombia, conquered the USA (for another Mexico achievement) and started preparations for the invasion on Europe. All goes well until Germany and Italy both lose. Then, all the small states, which were associated with Axis, suddenly landed in my faction, without even asking! Just because of some game rule, it can sometimes apply or disengage some countries in your alliance. And You - Don't. I understand it was made not to ruin some multiplayer games, but now it certainly ruins single-play.Next, the wars. At first, they seem much clever than in the 2nd and 3rd HoI - you can issue your generals some master plan, and they will be pursuing it by themselves - which especially cool, if you have multiple wars or fronts simultaneously. But then you notice that every war where you move troops yourself proceeds much faster and better than leaving it to AI. So, no, the micromanagement is still a must, for almost every operation. You have to move your troops yourself, and you always need to observe all your territories, or enemies will make an invasion far in your safe zone and conquer your capital city, while your main forces will be very far away, like in Africa or India... AI battleplan logic, even based on the stats unknown to a player (like the size of fortifications, for the most obvious example) - still lose too many manpower in every war, every single battle, with constant zerg rushes and zeroed organization stat. Remember human waves cliche? Well, it's the most obvious tactic for the AI, not for Russia or China, but for every country.More to it! By some strange logic, if your forces are attacking from the territory of another state, the game counts them as the forces of that state. Like if Soviets goes through neutral Poland straight to Berlin, the game greets brave Poles for Their success! And if you conquer some distant land like Australia, you can't be sure, that the game counts that victory to you. In my case, another (allied) nation landed in another part of that continent, haven't got at least one city - but was awarded as a whole winner when I took Canberra.Or, another case, back to weird diplomacy. The civil war started in Norway, Sweden, and Afganistan. One side marked as Axis, other as Comintern, the game merged all civil wars together with some other conflicts, basically, the World War has started. I, as the Soviet Union, with help from Finland, took the northern parts of Norway and Sweden, and all was going well, I was so close to their capitals when Soviet Afganistan have lost its domestic war. Right away, the game makes some automatic treaty and counts all three civil wars as closed, and Axis forces as winners. All the northern parts of Sweden and Norway now belongs to Axis and all the local forces that were on the Soviet side, now our enemies. Just because the game says so. Yeah, very logical, very realistic.I can proceed with examples, but they will take us too long. Aviation and artillery cases still far from perfect, and instead of fixing it, Paradox in ver. 1.4 killed the fleet strategies as well... Even the sound options menu is still far from perfect, as it counts some random and totally irrelevant background sounds like shooting and howling of planes on fly-by as "effect" and not "ambient". And if you don't want to hear all those stupid "wruum, bah-bah" all the way, but want to hear sounds when clicking buttons - sorry! It's the 1+1 type of deal! Take the good with the bad, or leave it be!Just like that, there are too many sides of this really good and complex game, which don't feel alright. Let's finish there, with a quick summary. Is the game better than the 2nd or 3rd Hearts of Iron? With visuals and lower entry level, with the better aid of modders straight from the Steam Community - Yes, naturally.You'll still need to learn many things there to operate successfully. But once you'll manage that learning curve (about 30-100 hours average) - you'll start to lose your interest, as it's all not that random, as with Civilization games, and not that logically and historically correct, as previous Paradox games. On the other hand, those questionable game decisions made multiplayer much more acceptable, in general gaming sense. As a solo player, I can't really agree with that turn of the tide. With all disadvantages from diplomacy and other game mechanics, I can't value it higher than 7/10. Buy it at your own risk. There are no such limitations as with previous games like you've might hear, "play it only if you're good enough with Europa Universalis" or so, but, if you're wasn't daydreaming on history and logic classes, the 4th HoI still leaving too much to wish for sweeten the taste.
NeonHaggis	Recommended	53.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007683294/	Great game, but anyone buying a Paradox product at anything less than 50% off is basicly paying an idiot tax.
Tyrone	Not Recommended	778.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198214244905/	Oh Paradox, WHY??? The first 200 hours of this game were so good and then the dlc began to come out. I do not so much care about the focuses as I would actually pay for some of those. But, the breakthrough feature and license production should be included base game with the patches. Additionally, the dlc countries are able to overpower the majors with absolutely idiotic AI that has no clue what is happening. Please fix the game and add the game mechanics for free and I would be open to paying for national focus trees.Thanks,The most dumb AI player in the game,Benito Tortellini Mussolini Naval Invasionilini

Nato Havoc	Recommended	411.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198112553759/	Let me tell you a story, a story about how a small and obscure nation, would come and rise to glory and ultimately shape history forever...It is 1938 and the Munich Conference is in to discuss theSudeten crisis. France and the United Kingdom came to decide the fate of little Czechoslovakia's northern front, the Sudetenland. Both of these powerful nations, France and the U.K. decided to fall in to the German Reich's demands for the land, effectively giving it to them. But when the German soldiers went to their "newly aquired lands" they saw forts, bunkers and all sorts of fortifications along the border, with Czechoslovakian flags held high. See, the Czechs had a fear of this crisis since 1936, and they acted on it. They build great land forts, built the army, worked on moving to a full war economy and mass produced weapons. The Czechs were ready to defend their rightful home. 2 months will pass and the German Reich will demand that Czechoslovakia surrender the land or there will be war... The Czech president sent a message to the German aggressors, "Come and take it", at that moment, In 1938, the German Reich decalred war on the Czechs. No help from the U.K. or France made the situation look dire, but the brave Czechs had a plan, they reformed the "Little Enente" of Yugoslovia and Romania. Hungary, bordering the east of Czechslovakia would go onto join the Axis, and try to invade Slovakia, but Romanian troops will crush the Hungarian menace, and absorb their lands. Its now 1939 and Italy has not decided to enter the war, and Romanian and Yugoslavian troops occupied by fighting to defend Yugoslavia from German invasions, was unable to help the Czechs against Germany, Czechoslovakia stood alone. They saw the German army, the Panzers, the Luffwaffe, and decided that they must hold the line. Winter, 1939 German troops are suffering heavy from attrition, the Czechs have been prepared for winter and have plenty of equipment to hold, then, on December 17, 1939, the Field Marshall of the Czecholslovakian Army ordered a push to attack the encamped Germany attackers. The Czechs raided out of their bunkers and attacked the unprepared Germany army. The Germans were rapidly pushed back, Almost no rest for the retreating German army made them weak. January 12, 1940 -- The capital of the former nation Austria, Vienna, has been taken by Czech forces, the same will be with Nuremberg, Munich. March 11, All of former Austria has been taken by Czech forces, and the entire southern half of Germany has been taken. March 13, The Soviet Union will inavde Poland, and begin to justify war against the Czechoslovakian goverment. In March 27, 1940, the capital of the German Reich, Berlin, will fall to Czech forces, Germany is contemplating surrender. A day later, March 28th, Italy will decide it cannont stand idely by while their ally is being demolished, they declare war on Czechoslovakia. Italy will launch a full invasion on Yugoslavia, in April, Yugoslavia will capitulate to the Italians. Every bit of Germany has been taken except the city of Hamburg, the last bastion of the Nazi goverement. In September of 1940, the German Reich will capitulate to Czech troops. Italy stands alone against the Czech might, A massive army pushed down the Italian pennisula and in December of 1940, Rome will fall. In Early 1941, Italy will surrender to Czech forces, and will be left with control only over Sicily and Sardina, effectively kicked off mainland Europe. In March of 1941, Japan will enter the war and attempt to restore the GErman Reich, their invasion will be stopped. In May, 1941, Japan will give up on the war and ask for peace. The Allies are fighting against Comintern forces while the Czechs consolidate their newly aquired land of Germany, Austria and Italy... and remember the day that when their freedom was in danger, they fought, fought valiantly for it, and won.The course of human history was changed that day, WW2 never occured, America and the Allies will fight and destory the Soviet Union in late 1944, the Cold War will never happen, and Czechoslovakia will become one of the most powerful nations in the world. Czechmate.15/15 Would change history again

EvilsBane	Not Recommended	165.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197961771811/	My least favourite of all paradox titles. Its not a terrible game, however I can't recommend it due to the following reasons.1. Set up for DLC spam. The country national decisions are 100 percent designed to release DLC as country packs, and I think it took away from the potential of the game. With that being said, these things should be a part of the base game.The country national ideas for the axis and allies. ( Its a ww2 game )The specific targeting of enemy factories, railroads or most importantly radar towers.Command for blitzing through enemy lines.Historical portraits and flavour. ( maybe some jazz music for americans prior to war?? ) 2. No individuality between countries and more importantly military units. For example, the Russian T34 was the most feared tank of the great patriotic war, it was the tank that no one saw coming and the germans really did not have an answer for it. It was also simpler to produce and ship out to the front lines. In the game however, it has the same production cost and combat statistics as the Pz4 and M4 Sherman. I understand they wanted to make the game simpler for a broader audience, but I think this is too far. A Mongolian cavalry unit in Europa has different stats than a French one, as it should... I don't understand what went wrong here.3. It looks like the game was designed with Tablets in mind. The way you drag battle lines and draw offensive plans just screams android game to me. The Icons for production, national decisions and trade are also very big and look like something out of a mobile game. Everything in the HUD kind of looks like one of those old telephones for elderly people. The biggest give-away that this was probably what they were thinking in development is that you cannot simply type the number of planes you want to select, you have to click icons repeatedly until you have the desired number.Look, It's not a horrible game, I did have fun with it. I just think that for the price, there are better grand strategy games out there. If you like the RTS genre and really want an amazing WW2 strategy game, try company of heroes 1. Its a complete game not designed with DLC spam in mind and It has the same amount of depth as this pretend grand strategy.P.S. I believe we as consumers have to be more vocal about what we believe to be a complete game. A WW2 grand strategy game that released without the ability to "spearhead" through enemy lines, is not a complete game. They knew everyone would play as Germany and want to thrust tank divisions and surrounds soviet pockets, so they released the feature as DLC. This was not something that came later, this was the plan from week one of development. Publishers will push this on us as much as they can. Anyone who started playing paradox games because the total war franchise DLC'd itself to death will know what i am talking about. If you don't speak up about this now, you are looking at day 1 blood and gore DLC in a war game. Be vocal guys.

alexanderpurves	Recommended	434.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198075481635/	Hearts of Iron IV is drastically different from Hearts of Iron IIIAlmost in every way better.Hearts of Iron IV manages to remove all of the extra complexities of HOI3 without sacrificing the in-depth nature of Paradox games. For example:I have almost 250 hours in HOI 3 and I still don't fully grasp naval combat. I have almost 2 hours in HOI 4 and I almost fully get naval combat. The one thing I would say is that personally I prefer HOI 3's graphics but that's just my preference. I know a lot of people prefer the new graphics more.Paradox rebuilt this game from the ground up, and in conclusion, made it amazing.

The Long Haul Home (At AIT)	Not Recommended	451.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/82nd_Toby/	I have to say, I love this game. The graphics are amazing and the game is great. I have yet to play more than 10 hours of this game, in vanilla. Most of my time is with mods, and I still use mods when I want a 'vanilla' feel. I rarely buy DLC in the first place and if I do, it's because it's during one of Steam's sales. I like the mechanics that have been put out...WAIT ONE MOMENT! Is there a feature called 'License Production' or something like that? Is it in a DLC? WAIT ONE MOMENT AGAIN! I remember it was in the base game for HoI III, the precursor. It came as a regular feature. And HoI III and all the DLC was around 10 bucks. If you have a computer that can play HoI III still, do it. It's curve is harder and steeper, but it's easier. It can be more hands on or even on auto pilot, but that's the best part. I love strategy games, I do. I love Hearts of Iron, it's probably my favorite game. I almost have 300 hours into and will continue to play it. But I have to play with mods. It's the only reason why I play the game. New mods with different ideas and stuff. Is it sad I'm missing out on things that would spice the game up? Hell yea. I want to be Germany and equip my men with the M1 Garand and use the P-51 in the skies with my Bf-109. It bumps everything up into a more life like quality. But if they expect me to pay any sort of price for a feature that was included in the game before as a standard feature, that's ridiculous. I hate how games are half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥now. And as you can see, so are a lot of people. If Paradox wants to keep us happy and loyal, start including DLC content in patches or start giving away the DLC for free. *Drops mic*If I'm wrong about the License Production feature in HoI III, lemme know.

Fooproof	Recommended	334.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fooproof/	 TL;DR You get to play as Hitler, lead a communist uprising in France and turn the great U.S. of A Fascist in one of the most engaging theatres of war in the history of mankind. Strongly recommended if you are a big WWII history buff. Do I buy this? Yes, but be prepared to fork over more cash for DLCs. Long Version  Disclaimer :  Hearts of Iron IV  is my first and only  Hearts of Iron  game. I will not be able to compare it to other games in the franchise nor touch on how the game has improved over its predecessors. Hearts of Iron IV  is one of the best looking grand strategy games to date. From well defined and detailed land masses while you're zoomed out to tiny soldiers and tanks duking it out along your frontlines when you're zoomed in,  Hearts of Iron IV  has substantial visual fidelity. Functionality isn't sacrificed either; beautiful features like cities, vegetation, terrain and rivers are all modelled out accurately as they have significant effects on gameplay.However,  Hearts of Iron IV , like other Paradox Grand Strategy Games, has a steep learning curve. If you're jumping into the game without prior research on the gameplay mechanics of HOI4, you might find yourself confused and upset that your All-American Reich has failed miserably. This is one of those games where you could leave something on and be  unintentionally sabotaging  your entire game. To top it off, the extremely detailed HUD can be a nightmare for newbies to navigate and the information provided by said HUD can be  overwhelmingly  hard to understand.Most problems posed by the game can be remedied using mods available on the Steam Workshop. However, DLC is a major issue for this game. If you have played any other Paradox Grand Strategy game, you will know exactly what I'm getting at. Whenever a new DLC is released I often feel that features included  should have been in the base game. For example, the new Decisions mechanic that was added, allowed you to make changes to the political direction of your country without an absurd arbitrary 70 day wait time, was only available through DLC. Revisions and improvments made to Japan for example, is only available in the Waking the Tiger DLC. There is a huge issue where mechanical improvements and content revisions are stuck behind a paywall. Hearts of Iron IV  is a game for Grand Strategy fans and WWII history buffs with enough disposable income to purchase a full game and all it's DLCs to be able to experience the game fully. With content based and quality of life mods being added to it's Steam Workshop every day,  Hearts of Iron IV  has an insane amount of replayability.

LanCeloT	Recommended	506.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LanCeloT0711/	I am a person who only really plays first-person shooters, and very little of any strategy games. However, when I picked up History as an elective to take in school(I live in Singapore, by the way.), and when we started to dive into the history of not just Singapore but into WW1, WW2, the Cold War etc, History just instantly became my favourite subject, and I always looked forward to its lessons. I then decided to watch some YT videos to help me understand more on certain topics, and then I went to sources other than videos to further enhance my knowledge on historical events. Soon many of my classmates would constantly ask me questions about History and sooner or later I was kind of a History 'guru' to not just my peers but to even my teachers and my own family.Then, I saw the movie called "Fatherland" online, and I loved it. It was an alternate history, where the Nazis were victorious in WWII. I then saw a video on YT - a Fatherland game. I genuinely thought it was a game made exclusively for the Fatherland movie/book, but then I realized it was a mod for another game, called Hearts of Iron 4. I went on Steam to read about it, and it was instantly in my wishlist. It went there as 39.00 SGD is quite steep for me, especially I'm more of an FPS guy. Thus, I waited for a sale - and I waited really long for it.A few months after, and HoI was under the Steam Christmas sale 2017. HoI 4 was 15 SGD! What a great deal, I thought. I took my remaining steam balance and bought it. Let me tell you right now, for a gamer that strictly plays FPS, I never regretted spending $15.00 for HoI4, hell, if I paid full price back then for $39.00 I still wouldn't have regretted it. It was installed rather quickly, and I launched it. The loading screen was rather long, but when I was at the tutorial, I was extremely overwhelmed. Millions of buttons on my monitor - the entire world map - I never felt so lost in a game before. The tutorial was honestly no help, and after 30 minutes of playtime, I started to think whether it was a good purchase of 15 Singapore Dollars.I then went on YouTube to find some tutorials, and made sure I took note of them. I launched back HoI, and this time I went on to play as the Glorious German Reich led by the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler. Why? Because, why not? And gosh, with me being more familiar with the HUD, I was having a good time going through events such as the Remilitarization of the Rhineland, Anschluss, Demanding Sudentenland etc. I was building up my powerful Wehrmacht, equipping them with the best Generals and Field Marshals that I had. Erwin Rommel, Erich von Manstein, Heinz Guderian, Albert Kesselring, Gerd von Runstedt - they were all there. In my government, people like Martin Bormann, Joseph Goebbels, Albert Speer and even the dreaded Heinrich Himmler, were all there, and I can choose who I wanted. I can choose my own designers for the equipment I'm producing, and even choose my very own Oberkommando der Wehrmacht, the High Command of my Army. Ludwig Beck, Karl Donitz, Hermann Goering, all these famous leaders were in the list. It's pretty obvious now, but I was highly immersed in this war strategy game once I understood the HUD. I soon went to war against Poland, and I won with relative ease. Then I went straight on into France and into the Benelux region... and that's where it hit my head - in a strategy game... I should have a strategy to take down these nations. I blindly put my frontlines on all these Western Countries without touching Division Templates/utilizing support equipment, and just went,"Hey, Army 1, just go head on into Paris... erm... Army 2 you can go into the Netherlands, and Guderian, just go into Belgium. There, WW2, ez game."Being the ignorant guy I am, I totally forgot about 2 important things - the Air Force - and the Navy. I had planes doing nothing, and my ships were docked at Konigsberg, also doing nothing. Sooner or later, my forces were drained, and I lost. To France. Pretty hard to write that in this review. Yea, I see you, pressing the "Funny" button below this review. I went back into YouTube and made sure I learnt everything about going to war. I went back onto my game, and this time I took out France and the Benelux with ease. I went into Denmark, naval invaded Norway, and they all capitulated before 1941. I went into the Middle East and invaded Turkey, Iraq, and others. I then went into war against the USSR, and of course, I lost. But holy crap, I never had so much fun in 1 game session before. ...then I bought the DLCs(Their DLC Policies are disgusting) and played many other nations. After which... I was earning 0 achievements because of my Ironman mode turned off. An idiot, I am.tl;dr is, HoI 4 is an easy to learn but hard to master game, especially for me, and if you love History as a subject, you should definitely try out this game. You can play any nation, and live out its destiny freely. The amount of detail that went into the Division Designers and such are very much up there, and is really fun to decide which is good for which situation. Then you can pick whatever strategy you want, such as annexing Poland by 1937 as Germany without Allied Intervention etc. Oh, and don't forget the mods. One of the other reasons why I didn't earn any achievements(Even when its a mod to change a flag ;-;). With Waking the Tiger on the horizon, I have never been so hyped for a strategy game. Never in my life, and I look forward to reviving the Kaiserreich/challenge Japan as China with their new focus trees. This is a 8/10 for me. Due to its bugs, DLC policies, and poor optimization at 5 speed, it got a lower score. Actually, I give it a 8.5. The .5 for the soundtrack. Absolutely epic.Thank you for taking your precious time reading this poorly written review :)

Prime Minister Sinister	Not Recommended	476.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/doktorsoviet/	Eh.It's hard to talk about Hearts of Iron IV. On one hand, it is incredibly addicting and I've spent far too much time on it. On the other hand, it presents a shallow and fundamentally broken experience, especially compared to previous titles in this series.The game essentially does three things right: allowing you to manage and control the finite details of your armies equipment chain, allowing you a very large degree over the organization of your troops through the Division Designer, and allowing you to paint the map your color. While it represents a step up from past titles in this regard, everything else is incredibly barebones.There is almost no diplomacy to speak of. Diplomacy is dead simple and plays out the same in nearly every game. Like-minded countries with the same ideology will join together in factions when world tension is high enough, but beyond getting countries to join your faction, diplomacy is utterly useless. Non-aggression pacts are about as effective as they were in real life (that is to say they aren't at all) and the only other thing you can do with diplomacy is trade for resources. Trading is the only incentive to keep other factions happy.There's no espionage. I'm not just being facetious; I quite literally mean there is no espionage system. One of the most important fronts of WWII is simply absent from the game. Supposedly it will come at a later date, but knowing Paradox, they'll make you buy it as DLC, just like numerous other essential features that were missing at launch.There's barely any politics or internal management of your country. You accumulate something called "political power" which you use to change laws and appoint advisers, but the system is honestly just plain stupid because every nation accumulates political power at the same rate (+2 per day) unless they are researching a national focus. For most of the laws, they are just straight upgrades, and thus there is no thought or incentive to choose one law over the other. You will always enact mobilization at the earliest opportunity, you will always enact conscription at the earliest opportunity, and unless you play a resource-poor nation, you will always get up to an export-focused economy. And those three laws are all you get, just conscription, trade, and mobilization. There are elections, but they are dead simple events. There are also political parties, but outside of player input or national focuses, their influence can't be changed and thus there is no challenge.Warfare is a bit of a mess. The game uses a frontline system where the actual tactics are automated to AI generals, and you merely draw battleplans. You can (and should) directly order divisions around, but if they don't have orders then they get a penalty, so the game actively incentivizes the frontline system. The problem with that is the AI.Oh the AI. Or lack thereof. HOI4 easily has the worst AI of any Paradox title to date. It often abandons active frontlines and leaves them wide open to attack, and the generals' AI has a habit of waltzing right into salients and getting cut off. Entrusting any large front to the AI is a death sentence, but you need to do it to get combat bonuses. As far as the country AI, is basically doesn't exist. The AI doesn't react dynamically or really have any long-term strategy. Instead, it operates on pre-programmed values; it is scripted to behave a certain way in all conditions, rather than reacting to a situation dynamically. This is most evident when the AI is losing a war but chooses a national focus that declares war on yet another country, because the AI literally has no idea that it is at war. Go ahead, look in the code. You'll see all the AI "strategies" are smoke and mirrors. It also makes diplomacy pointless, as countries are often scripted to be afraid of one another regardless of circumstances.And the national focus system is just a cop-out for having to make actual, dynamic AI. It is basically just alternate history trees that allow you to take a nation down an ahistorical path, or it just gives you bonuses. The trees are poorly balanced, as every focus takes 70 days to complete, but many of them are just straight up not worth it. Not every country gets a unique tree, either.Yet despite all this, HOI4 is hard to put down. It is so streamlined and simple that it actually becomes cathartic to play, at least until the AI craps its drawers again. You are better off investing in the much cheaper and more complete Darkest Hour: A Hearts of Iron Game, as long as you can tolerate the dated aesthetics. However, the one saving grace of HOI4 is the astounding modding community. There are plenty of excellent mods to choose from, with Kaiserreich being the most notable one. Most of these mods totally blow the vanilla gameplay out of the water with a massive amount of events and custom gameplay features. They, and they alone, are the only reasons to invest in HOI4 right now. If you don't care about playing with mods, don't even bother.
Dire Poops	Recommended	115.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Direpoops/	If you want strategy, then you have many other choices. This is a WW2 sandbox simulator. You will not colonize, rule vassals, spread religion, make trade fleets, make investments, or have have plentiful diplomatic interactions and choices.On the other hand, the WW2 simulation is supreme. You will build factories, infrastructure, bases... You will be sorely tempted to wage war on minor nations for more oil, steel, rubber... but would that raise world tension too much so other major players get involved? Which front do you put your finite amount of tanks on? How do you build your divisions and battalions? Which generals and field marshall's do you put on the African front? HoI4 is heavy on supply management. You will need to anticipate the need for every piece of equipment your nation will need well ahead of needing it. Nearly every aspect related directly to conflict and world policy at the time is reflected in the game.As someone who has an interest in WW2, I enjoy this a lot. My only criticism is I find navy management difficult, and perhaps that'll be refined in the upcoming major navy focused update but idk I haven't been following.
Burke	Not Recommended	376.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Burkezerker/	REVIEW IS INCREDIBLY OUT OF DATE AND WILL BE UPDATED WITH THE NEXT EXPANSIONAS OF RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME (Oak 1.4.0 patch)Things to know before you get angry: As I said, this is for the "CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME". As things are fixed, added, etc. I will adjust this review. Should Paradox actually fix a majority of these problems I'll be more than happy to change this to a positive review. I want this game to succeed, but I'm not going to give Paradox the leeway I would have given them 10 years ago because they're no longer a 'small studio' and they're not trying to do something 'they've never done before' anymore. They are a successful and large studio that produces their own products as well as publishes other developer's titles. With that said, here's the list both critical and harsh on the game and the developer. I'm not kind but it's also not my job to be their best friend.____________________________________THE BADSubmarines: Useless. I'm not even kidding, they're still broken even in Oak.Large Navies: Not needed, you will only need one basic navy to invade the United States from Germany. AI: Obsessed with mini-naval invasions that accomplish nothing but annoying the player. In addition to that, the "snake invasion" still happens where the AI goes on a roadtrip because the AI wasn't fixed at all. The video below is an accurate depiction of what the AI is like in Russia and Africa.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8bD5mVOW70In addition to that, the AI still manages armies poorly (divisions are a mess), factories poorly (they cram as much as they can into a single line, resources be damned) and will do the weirdest things like Japan sending troops to Africa instead expanding their own areas in Indochina. Ask any person who has played this game, let the game run and then switched to one of the AI countries whether they were impressed with the AI's managerial skills. I can guarantee 9 out of 10 of them will say they weren't impressed and/or facepalmed. *PATCH ADDITION: Oak 1.4, AI still building ridiculous divisions that can be plowed over by the 7 infantry 2 artillery build. Astro-Hungary can topple the Reich by simply sitting on a fort until Germany's supplies are gone and then rush to Germany.Convoys: Absolutely no control over them so deciding which waters to patrol to protect them is nullified. Don't worry though, the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.Resources: If you loved the resources in HOI3 making the game strategic this game will make you rage. I hate the term "dumbed down" but there is no better explanation for what has happened with it since oil is just a manufacturing resource and has nothing to do with sustaining your army, navy or air force. You could literally have 100+ Yamato-class Battleships floating around the world on active combat missions and it will not harm your overall economy one bit. I'm all for 'gameplay over realism' but this is a war simulator and Hitler sacrificed an entire army to rush Russia's southern oil fields for a reason and it wasn't because he needed oil to increase tank production but to keep the tanks functioning.Tanks: Don't build anything but heavy tank TDs. Win the game.Air Force: The only useful aircraft at the moment are fighter aircraft. I was able to defeat the whole world without having to build anything but fighters and a few token transport planes for paratroopers. All the other aircraft are simply for roleplay purposes. Still the same with Oak.Nukes: Underwhelming. The infrastrucutre damage they do hardly affects the enemy. We're not asking for the nukes to wipe out entire armies here, but at least damage the enemy's manpower and national unity a bit more than it does.National Focus: Possibly the worst part of this title. Takes away player agency and diplomacy to force nations into war. Rather than the AI thinking for itself it relies on national focuses to drive it to a conclusion. The only way to get an ahistorical approach is to do super gamey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to force the game into a direction.An example of why this is a problem: Historically Germany declared war on the Soviet Union after the defeat of France but that doesn't always work like that in a video game since variables can change things or the player changes things. Say, for whatever reason, Germany is stuck at a standstill against the French and British. If the national focus for a war with the Soviet Union is up next on the chopping block Germany will take it and will go to war with the Soviet Union when it's done regardless of their ability to fight such a war. This is the same whether you're in historical settings or not, the National Focus is the same regardless and it not being set to historical just randomizes the AI's choices, not their thinking and execution. I hope this explanation drives home why EUIV style diplomacy is FAR preferable to the current state of the game. The AI needs to think and not just follow an order of pre-set casus belli event flags as it does right now.Diplomacy: See above. If you want a diplomatic game get EUIV, Victoria or even Civ. Peace Conferences at the end of wars are not optimal. Due to my character limit I suggest other reviews for a more in depth analysis of it and trust me, there are many and one of which is the AI declaring wars they cannot win.Paradox Studios: Constant vacations, poor community support, slow patches, broken patches when finally released, the only working patches tend to be done by the community, DLC of paid features that were present on launch in previous titles, abrasive staff that is combative with community criticism (visit their forums) and the list goes on. Paradox from the days of CK2 and EUIV seem to be gone and replaced by spiteful 'LALALALALALALALA' moderators that don't pass along complaints but instead try to make excuses. It has even hit the point where they are now telling us to be thankful that they were ever so generous as to include 3D sprites claiming they are "time consuming and expensive" when the mod community produces them for free all the time without extra cost or hassle. THE GOODGraphics: It's better than your standard Paradox game.Performance: As of Patch "Torch" 1.3.3 the performance has been improved a lot. I was able to play into 1944 without the game turning into a slideshow for the first time since launch.Sound: They've done a lot of work with the sound effects. They get repetitive, but this is a strategy game. Can't judge too harshly on something most of us turn down the volume on anyways.Good Mod Community: Mods disable achievements, which is annoying as ****, but they make the game better. Honestly, I sometimes wish these modders would be hired by Paradox because they do a far superior job to their current staff. They make better 3D models, better music, better tech trees, more imaginative gameplay mechanaics and so much more. Paradox used to be some of the best developers out there but lately their games are only as good as the mod community can make them... holy ****, sounds like Bethesda. ____________________________________Conclusion: Save your money right now. Even into the first expansion this game is worse than some early access titles I've played and far more expensive than they are. I also don't recommend buying this game on my praise to the skies of the modding community, this game is incredibly lacking and I don't think many of the big modders will be around when this game is finally finished. If this game improves I'll remove this, but as it stands now I highly recommend waiting and seeing how it turns out in 1-3 years and by then Victoria 3 will be out which, hopefully, Paradox will outsource to another studio.

BeefSupreme	Not Recommended	947.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034962524/	The game was released undercooked a year and a half ago, and to this day it remains the same. The AI is poor to say the least. It can't hold a line, it's incapable of dealing with pockets and encirclements and it keeps building divisions way, way far past the point of reason. They starve themselves of manpower and supplies, making all of their armies collapse. The singleplayer game is broken by said AI. The multiplayer game has gotten a lot better. But again, there are a lot of problems they don't seem to want to fix, these are more minor and can be solved with some simple rules. The DLC model is absolute garbage. Each one includes a bunch of stuff that modders seem to do better (such as national foci and new releasable nations) along with one or two features that should have been included in the original game (simple political options for puppets and the blitz feature [yes. the blitz order is a paid feature. -_-]).All in all, not worth the money until the hoi4 team/paradox get their act together. I will change review upon improvement, I assure you.Edit: Some effort is finally going into improving AI. This will be a slow process however, keep watching. This is a very good sign. Once AI improvement is at a point where it's passable and a single player experience is enjoyable, I'll change my review entirely.btw: for the fanboys who want to defend the game and call me out on hours spent. Those have been hours spent asleep, as I fell asleep while modding to game to fix it. So don't bother with the talking point.
The Dude	Recommended	3,977.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198143090969/	Great game have played it for like 2000 hrs now and wow really good with all  the mod support
Beardisium	Not Recommended	207.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Beardisium/	As if the AI wasn't already absolute trash, this game has the worst war resolution system ever made. Declare a war, fight all of the war, then at the end during the peace conference watch nations you aren't allied with take everything you claimed. For no reason, and with no explanation.If wars cannot be prosecuted to a resolution I desire, or even one that is somewhat fair then that makes this worthless as a war game.As an example, a friend and I are playing and form our own fascist faction - the United Imperial Nations - he is the United States and I am an angry Argentina. By July of 1940 he's taken Canada and Mexico and is now the Free American Empire, and I have taken all of the South American continent for the glory of the Argentine League. We begin consolidating our power base as a unified American continent - a terrifying military machine, to be sure.Germany and the traditional AI join the Axis. Norway, Sweden and a few smaller island nations are in the UIN (our faction) and the Allies, the usual lot sans the United States, are basically at war with every other faction in the game at once, even the communist COMINTERN nations. Fast forward to Sep. 1949. The Free American Empire covers from Canada to the Panama canal, as well as 90% of the African territories and the entirety of the United Kingdom. The Argentine League had conquered New Zealand, Australia, and all of the islands supplying any naval routes in the Pacific ocean. It was, of course, an intense and hard fought war. Covering many fronts and foreign lands, it was a valiant fight that saw more than 500,000 brave Argentine men and women die for their homelands. Technologically Argentina may be behind other more "advanced" nations, but her people are resilient and fierce and will fight to the last. By decree requiring women and all healthy citizens above the age of 15 to fight we are able to purge the devil of democracy from most of the civilized world.After the fall of the last bastion of Allied power, the British Raj in India in January 1950, the Allies unconditionally surrender to the multiple factions that have laid waste to their lands. Here is where it goes bad: Germany immediately puppets Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Ireland, and takes most of the other choice territory such as island chains with ports and anything with natural resources. It goes first in picking what it wants because it has the most warscore since it was the aggressor in many of the wars that all got put together into the one war - our alternate history's WW2. Even though it didn't start it. Even worse, Germany never saw a single soldier set foot on a single one of the nations she is able to puppet. Never stationed a CVBG off those shores, never even did so much as did a fly-over. Our faction took those lands, and for ourselves. So essentially, Germany is able to button us in entirely having never fought for any of the land it is claiming.This makes no sense whatsoever. Even worse is that because of the way the game folds every war into a single war as world tension increases, you will most likely always be lower than the "big ones" unless you play a power nation from the start. I don't want to play Germany, the Soviet Union, or the United States to get a fair shot at WW2's peace talks. I want to be able to be anyone, any nation, and keep what my men bled and died for when the dust is settling. Because anything else, in a strategy game like this, is a waste of my time.It's even more of a shame, really, because if you can't tell when it is working this game is fun. Hours and hours of fun, until it spits in your face and ruins everything.On top of that, Paradox's DLC policy has gotten out of hand.

You can play as any nation of the time, and do what ever you want (to various degrees of success).Overall, if you like grand strategy and WW2 era strategy, you will probably like this game.

Fyeris	Recommended	926.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Fyeris/	I had always been skeptical of playing the Hearts of Iron series of games due to their insane complexity. However, recently, due to the reviews "complaining" about simplicity of game mechanics, I decided to give it a go. I'll let you know from the beginning that I made a huge mistake not trying it earlier, as this game is phenomenal. Here is a run down of my first campaign:- 1936, glorious Swedish democracy.- I begin working on increasing my civilian factory production, hoping to become an industrial powerhouse.- Research begins towards improving my industrial ability, learning how to make modern tools and such.- Spanish Civil War breaks out, and Sweden watches from the top of the world.- My economy is booming as 1937 rolls around, and I begin increasing my Warship production. Sweden will become the Arsenal of Democracy!- Spanish civil war ends in favor of the Communists, and the USSR is growing in strength as it crushes Japan in the east.- Germany takes Austria, the Czechs, Slovaks, Slovens before I even realize what happened.- Suddenly, Norway begins leaning towards Fascism. BIG MISTAKE.- War goals set on Norway, and the glorious Swedish army prepares to force democracy down the throats of all Nordic people.- War is declared, Norway goes Fascist, and the United Kingdom asks me to join the Allies. I decline, but liberate the SH*T out of Norway and her islands within a few months. "How about a cup of LIBER-TEA?!"- 1938 brings Soviet aggression in Europe, as Finland falls to Fascism and is annihilated almost immediately by the great Russian bear. Poland soon follows, and is made into a Soviet puppet along with Bulgaria.- Germany declares on the Allies, France fights hard, and is about to lose the fight when the glorious Swedes send 50,000 units of weapons to the wartorn country.- 1939: France holds on, and the rest of the free world comes to her aid. Italy capitulates, and Germany soon follows, as the USSR pushes them from the east when the opportunity is right.- 1940: Europe is divided between Democracy in the west, and Communism in the east, with glorious Sweden in the middle.- The USSR declares war on Iran, Turkey, and her middle-eastern allies. Sweden sees its opportunity.- GLORIOUS SWEDEN JOINS THE ALLIES, AND DECLARES WAR ON THE COMMUNIST FILTH.- Greece is the only country that joins glorious Sweden in her quest for global freedom, and begins pushing in the south.- 1941: Glorious Sweden takes back Finland, Murmansk, and the Baltic states! - 1942: The Allies decide that the opportunity is right, and send over 1,000 divisions of free peoples from around the globe down the throat of eastern Europe. LET FREEDOM RING!- 1943: The USSR is on the ropes. Sweden's 150 divisions are encircling Moscow, supported by the UK, France, Benelux, South American nations, Greece, Turkey, and Liberated spain. - 1944: The Soviet Union is now the Democratic Republic of Russia. Glorious Sweden takes Finland and the Baltic states as her prize. Glory be unto the free people of Scandinavia. - 1945: Sweden acquires nuclear technology, and begins the drive to crush the remaining Axis power: Japan.- 1946: Japan is a crater. - Swedish Democracy Simulator.I would highly recommend this game. I would gladly bring Glorious Swedish Democracy to the unfree people of the world again. 10/10 for sure.
Flizzy	Recommended	1,431.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BluEnthusiast/	My game of the year.I started playing this game Febuary of this year (2017) and as of posting this review I have nearly 700 hours in the game. What enticed me to this game is the Millenium Dawn mod (As of this review my opinion on that mod has changed.) But even besides that mod the modding community is absolutely amazing. Steam Workshop support ensures that this game will have people playing it for a long long time. Besides mods the gameplay of the Vanilla game is fantastic. The mechanics and UI are challenging to learn at first but after a while will know them like the back of your hand. Even though playing as Germany or the US at first is aw great idea to get the bearings of the game, but playing as a minor such as the Peoples Republic Of China or Bulgaria, Yugoslavia (Especially with the Death Or Dishonor DLC) is great fun, Especially with mods such as The Road To 56 which gives these countries focus trees. The game is challenging, Not as challenging as say Europa Universalis 4 but it is much much more intuitive and the mechanics and al the moving parts work better than said games. That being said I have some gripes about Paradoxes DLC policy, but I will leave seperate reviews on the DLCs for that matter. This is an excellent grand strategy game and Paradox have been regularly been updating the game, With an update coming out early next year on the horizon. I wholeheartedly recommend to anyone looking for a new experience and maybe coming from Civilization or another Paradox game. Although the 40$ price tag is high for what it offers right now, Pick it up on the Christmas sale or another sale.10/10 Would buy 100 times over.2018 Edit: Now nearly 1500 hours into this game and my opinion about it has only improved with the Waking The Tiger DLC. Although I do not approve of Paradox's DLC policy for say, EU4 or Cities:Skylines, The DLC for this game is well thought out and truly makes improvements to systems where they need to be instead of adding purely cosmetics. Waking The Tiger and the 1.5 update is the strongest that the game has recieved to date. Adding in Decisions, and redoing base game content for the two main Axis powers was also a fantastic change. As of writing this update, the game is currently $16 dollars on steam. An absolute steal. The game still has quite a learning curve, and it definitely takes time to learn all aspects, but I think right now as of this edit (November 23rd) the game is in the best state its ever been in. With ever-expanding mod support and the base game getting more and more improvements with every update, with another update on the horizon, redoing naval combat, which is widely considered the most underdeveloped system in the game. This game is not only worth picking up for the base game, it's extensive mod support offers many mods through the Steam Workshop, with many more under development, and that only adds more and more longevity to the game.10/10

China now Mongolia. Japan not happy, delares war on Soviets and Mongolians. Mongolia make big boat and storm with the might of the Armies of Genghis Khan. Japan is now Mongolia. Mongolia now turns to its Soviet master. Mongolia is exception, Russian winter has no effect on the Mongolian heart. Soviet Union? Now Mongolian Union. Hitler request non-aggesstion pact with the great Khan. The Khan laughs and Germany falls. German Reich now Mongolia. UK thanks the mighty Mongols, Mongols thank UK by making them part of there Empire. USA not happy, they send mighty tanks and planes to kill Mongolia.

Devan the Dev	Not Recommended	894.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/devanthedev/	2018 EDIT NOTE-It should be noted that this review was written during the 2017 controversy in which Paradox  attempted to standerise their DLC prices by raising them across all  international regions. Although they later backed down I still disagree with their DLC policies. I love their games, but untill they make some real change in their business practices I can not in good conscious give this game a possitive recommendation, however I have updated my review for 2018 which you will find at the bottem of this page.ORIGINAL REVIEW-I AM GOING ON A FULL PARADOX STRIKE!!!! Their DLC across all of their grand stategy games has always been crazy but now it is just out of control. Death or Dishonor is a "Country Pack"!!! Please!!! What does Death or Dishonor do that Mods have not already!?!?!?!? Like the German offensive into the USSR they may have been destroying our wallets and winning thus far...BUT NO MORE!!!! The winter has come for Paradox and it is time for us as fans to push back!!!!-Do not get me wrong! I love this game and I adore Paradox as a game developer and that is exactaly why I am being so tough on them. This will destroy them in the end. It is time for us as fans to remeber that we control the market and we have the power to stop this! It is better to stop this now rather than later. RISE UP PARADOX FANS!!!! RISE UP AND SAVE YOUR GAMES!!!-But really though I am addicted to this game and can not stop playing so does it even matter?2018 UPDATE-I suppose it is unfair that I have not given this gave a rating like I have in all my other reiviews. Furthermore I have not actually reviewed the game, rather, I have written a rather passionate rant against Paradox that when looked at a year later may seem rather odd and nonsensical. As I stated in my 'edit note', my original review was written at a rather tense time that not everyone in the HOI4 community might be aware of. So put into its proper context my original review might begin to make more sense, however I have still failed to give a proper review and express my feelings on the game itself. I will now attmept to correct this.-The actual gave itself is great. It is more accessible than most grand strategy games and the modding community is one of the best on all of the Steam Workshop. The modding community insures that you will practically never grow bored, even after hundreds of hours. The game itself I would give a 8/10. It has some issues with AI and an overall lack of content, HOWEVER, if you factor in the many amazing mods you will have access to this game easily becomes a 10/10! -So yeah, 10/10 would mod again!
Shepard	Not Recommended	523.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198129784536/	I would love to give this game a positive review because I do enjoy this series to no end... sadly I'm not able to do that without compromising my integrity. I'm an avid history buff and a long-term fan since the first Hearts of Iron game, so what exactly is the problem you might ask? Here are the most important (IMHO) pros and cons:Pros:+ Deep and engaging gameplay. This game really shines at presenting the player with complex problems in a very orderly and easy to understand manner. It's streamlined without taking away too much (or any) depth at all.+ The frontline system. Sure it has it's problems but it works (or used to work) relatively fine. You can simply assign your divisions to the frontline (giving them a "programmable" AI) and attend to other matters without being too concerned about the wellbeing of your troops. This shifts your management focus from Micro to Macro. Similiar solutions have been implemented to Air and Navy.+ Freedom of choice. This time you are really able to just go in there and reshape the world to your liking, this is allowed by the way the ideologies work and the mechanics of National Focuses (something I was very sceptical about at first). The player can also choose between historical and ahistorical paths.+ Graphic design. I learned to love the new "artsy" style of the series, it's truly refreshing and nice to look at.Cons:- DLC policy and Paradox. It's not just about money anymore, this is a very serious issue that poses a danger to the industry. Right now you'd be a fool to expect Paradox games to be complete at launch. It feels like many features were purposfuly cut out from the base game (eg. Unique Focus Tree for China) and this includes stuff that was present in the previous titles (eg. Chain of Command). Let me stress that out... YOU ARE NOT BUYING THE COMPLETE GAME AT LAUNCH. The DLCs will be published continuously for years. The worst thing about it is that each new feature is a hit or miss, some of them are truly gamebreaking, for example the new Chain of Command feature forces you to draw multiple frontlines instead of a single solid front, this multiplies all the issues related to the frontline system and turns the game into a Micro Fest. Just make it fair... either raise the price of your basegame and sell flavour packs for a handful of dollars or publish reasonably priced expansion packs.- AI (or lack of thereof). The AI will kill itself on your fortified positions, it's generally best to play defensively, maintaining a relatively equal number of divisions and encouraging AI to keep assaulting until it runs out of equipment. Though the recent patches have improved the AI a fair bit.- Performance issues. By the year 1943 the AI will spam out hundreds of divisions causing performance drop even on very good platforms. A good workaround would be to put a reasonable cap on the maximum number of fielded divisions or somehow limiting the manpower. This issue remains unaddressed since the early HOI games. Again, the recent patches have helped a bit.- Paradox Forums. Their message board functions like a Gulag where each and every sign of dissent is being quelled.In conclusion: Paradox needs some tough love...

timmycee	Recommended	227.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029524203/	So here is my first impression of the game after about 6 hrs of game play. I have been a Heart of Iron player since 2002 (yes, since HoI1. At 36 years of age, I consider myself a mature adolescent who is fond of strategical and tactical games) and played quite a few other Paradox games (especially EU4). My review could go back and forward a little, but I just write down the things I noticed over these 6 hours.  I loved the movement the game has made since HoI3. The complexity level has gone down a little and it is somewhat easier to play and comprehend, but it has therefore also picked up a little bit of pace. Not a bad move in my opinion. The game feels like it has the right balance between pace, strategic decision making and low level management. The graphics are great, simple and very effective. I am no technical expert, but the engine looks comparable to EU4 with some enhancements left and right. The world looks amazing by night! The lights of the cities with planes flying above is gorgeous. The troop information differs based on your zoom level and shows just the information you need. The moment the transition from one information level to the other is made, seems a little bit off though. I played my first game as the Netherlands and determined my tactic up front. Align with the allies as soon as possible, retreat from my overseas colonies, make and hold fort Holland and give the allies an opportunity to use this beachhead. A tactic which worked out perfect and gave me a good view on the behavior of the AI.And to be honest, it seems to have some flaws in regard to tactical decision making. The game followed the historical developments and once the war between Poland and Germany had started, all Allies (who I could join at that moment) declared war and opened a West front. I was able to (quite easily) hold the province of Holland (gave up on the other provinces) and England and France came to the rescue. However, France off course was being targeted by Germany and Italy as well (same for Belgium). The French were actually winning the war with Italy and conquered Rome! However within a month after conquering Rome, Paris fell and the French surrendered completely giving back Italy to the Italians while it was on the verge of capitulating itself as well (Italy only had some minor provinces in the south at that moment). A similar thing happened to Belgium, while dozens of French and English divisions where creating and holding a beachhead and actually fighting back, Brussels fell and Belgium capitulated, isolating Fort Holland as well. The problem seems to be the victory points, which determine the outcome of the war. The conquering of certain provinces or areas gives you victory points and each country contains a number of points and it will capitulate after it loses a certain percentage of them. France for example will lose victory points if you conquer Dunkerque, Calais and of course Paris, for Belgium the majority is represented by Brussels. I would expect the AI to defend these victory points before moving attention anywhere else (so defend Paris before invading Italy). Also the victory points are now static, meaning that if Luxembourg para trooped into defenseless Brussels, Belgium would capitulate while in reality it probably could easily win the war. I like the victory points system in itself, but maybe a more flexible setup (don't exactly know how yet, but if Paradox is listening in: contact me! ;-) would be great. I also enjoyed parts of the AI. The troops I drew back from the Dutch Indies I used to help the Allies in other parts than Holland. While France was invading Italy, I recognized an opportunity to take Sicily. The English arrived just before me, creating a beachhead which I was able to use. The areas I conquered thereafter where recognized as English territory (not sure why and not sure if I mind it). Although the English had to retreat, I was able to hold most of the Isle, and the AI helped me by sending English troops, navy and intercepting Italian reinforcements. It seemed to work very well. I also like the option of volunteer troops. America, Spain and other allies send volunteer troops to help defend Holland, giving me extra manpower to defend and hold.The resource management system I still have some doubts about. It could be that missed some aspects, but the balance seems a little off. Steel seems to be overly important, while rubber seems the least important. I like the concept of trading and giving up some of your homeland factory capacity for it. What I don't like however is that it seems that you don't create stock. So for example if I produce tanks and need to import steel I will lose some of my factory capacity (fine), but if I stop producing tanks (or reduce the production speed), I will import more steel than needed and still lose the factory capacity. If I forget to cut the import I have lost capacity over time and did not get anything back (the surplus resource was not stored). How to solve? Automatic adjustment of import or maybe a warning if there is a surplus for imported resources just like you get a warning now if there is a shortage. Could be that I missed this maybe. Same seems to be going for produced equipment, although it looked there that there was some stock there. (Edit: Found it! There is stock, so no comments there). However the production screens and possibilities are perfect in themselves. Easy to master and understand and give the right information! All in all it is a fantastic game with some room for improvement. There are a lot more improvements made to game than discussed above, but they can still be optimized as well (drawing and making plans for your troops, the navy and air force screens). Everybody who was afraid for these type of games before can now join the fun and everybody who was already into these type of games are still very happy (like myself). It was worth the wait!

Vepatzioone	Not Recommended	1,566.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141645128/	The game is ok. Just HoI4 vanilla is kinda♥♥♥♥♥♥PROS:1. Fallback Order. its bretty good, makes defending 50 times better.2.Naval Combat and Ships. At the start of the game I didnt like it, but now I have grown fond of it. I love the look of Battlecruisers and will always attempt to build a lot of them If Im playing a minor nation. True beauties. Missing 3rd Battlecruiser tech tho.3. Voice acting. On point.4. Generals and Admirals are nice. Missing Airforce commanders but they are not really needed.5. Stats are nice. I like the stats6. Mods. They make this game bearable.CONS:1.The AI has severe mental issues.2.Only 1 Nation has unique AI, rest just follow some random generic garbage- the unique one being Germany.3.Only the German AI will build medium tanks, and only in 1936 start date4.Despite the, uh, INTERESTING Division Templates the AI uses it ONLY works for INFANTRY divisions, meaning it WILL NOT "improve" nor change any other division template besides Infantry ones. This of course excludes Germany who can build Tank Divisions. Not great tank divisions but tank divisions. Its better than nothing. Paradox recently remade the AI divisions maker thing, meaning the AI can now change Divisions, and for example, Mongolia can actually produce more divisions after it gets enough army experience to change all Cavalry regiments into Infantry regiments. Same with Nepal, if they would in some alternative universe ever get enough army experience.5.Because every AI is identical they all try to produce the same generic stuff, meaning you will NEVER see for example Heavy Tanks (not to mention SuperHeavyTanks), MotRocketArty, AA, RocketArty, Any Armor AA or SPG, ADVANCED SHIPS, Radar, Paratroopers in the 1936 start date. 1939 has some premade divisions so you might see Heavy Tanks from Soviet Union, and of course 1939 starts with slightly advanced ship tech so the AI will produce slightly advanced ships. Naturally not advancing from there.6. Equipment spam. The AI will always produce equipment, and rarely or ever does it stop producing with Military factories. Especially the minor nations in, lets say 1940 will have hundreds of thousands of equipment lying around. Paradox have tried to "fix" this by making the AI less likely to pick the Industry focuses if it is really small, but that really doesnt fix anything.7. The No Equipment spam. The Ai will still produce more divisions when in deficit with infantry equipment and it has manpower. This is horrible and will result in Divisions which cannot hold a simple line.8. Paradox doesnt know what a good division is. In the new ai "fix" the Ai will try to produce 40 width Infantry Divisions. They are just bad. It is especially bad when, for example Germany has conquered Norway (NOTE: only available with a mod, the AI will NEVER EVER manage to invade Norway. It is absolutely impossible. The only way is to give Germany free divisions into Norway) and for example tries to invade Sweden (has to be done manually) the Swedish AI has build about 20 divisions, and theyre all 40 width. The AI cannot man their borders. If the AI had retained its original 6inf Divisions it would have been plausible, if we forget for a second that the same AI that produces those units also has to use them properly.9.The AI attacking, and frontline order attacks. They are so bad, so so bad. It is painful to watch the AI attack my divisions over and over again never learning to either stop or try to breach through somewhere else. If you have played this game you have probably noticed that when you order your Divisions to attack with frontline attack order they will decide to attack for example 1 Division vs 5 enemy Divisions, which is doomed to begin with, and the Frontline AI will try to do so over and over again.9. Ships and Naval stuff. Contrary to many, I like the Naval Combat. Why is it in the cons section then? Because the ships themselves are done lazily. All the ships before and during world war 1 up to 1922 are in the same category. I HIGHLY doubt you will do it but if you will in the newest DLC (yay dlcs..) add new section of ships for the Pre-WW1 ships. I would like to have atleast 3 sections before 1922 ships but that will never happen, so atleast Pre-WW1. And please dont ♥♥♥♥ up Naval Combat, its one of the only things why I still play this game. Some other naval stuff I hate is the running out of ship names. This is especially notable for Portugal, who will produce a LOT of destroyers, and the last ones will be all called Contratorpeido 1. And for avid navy lovers such as myself building lots of Battleships for example as Italy will result in you getting Corazza 1 named ships forever. Its a simple fix to just remove the 1 from behnd every ship to make it slightly more bearable. (or cross ship names wink wink, meaning Battleships would get Destros names or something)Another naval thing is the Naval Invasions. As you said most players play as Germany, so that means that most players want the best experience as Germany right? Well the Naval Invasions are a large part of that. The AI will try to navally invade a lot, and its usual targets are ports. Sometimes, especially England and USA, they will tend to invade next to ports. This is great if the AI wasnt the AI it is. Right now thats just sacrifising a lot of good soldiers and equipment as they never manage to do anything. Well sometimes the AI has half a brain and it manages to invade a port. When landing it will either move ALL the invaders to inland effectively making it almost impossible to not get encircled, or the AI will just abandon the Invasion and go die of attrition into Africa or something.10.Airforce. Personally I dont invest too much into Airforce, since my precious research slots go to Ships (<3) and land troops. but neither does the AI! (excluding Air Doctrines). So Im all good producing Interwar Fighters as a minor and retaining Air Superiority just fine. You could ask how can I do that since majors can produce more planes, well because every single plane is on the English Channel of course! Thanks Isorrow or whoever gave that bright Idea to Paradox.11. Bugs and Annoyances. There are some bugs and annoyance in the game, such as in the Australian Focus tree supporting Westminster doesnt grant you the Democratic supporter, but you need Communism for that. Other annoyances include the overlook of focuses in the 1939 start date. China has completed few focuses for his interantional part of the tree, without researching the First Focus of the tree. SAF and AST cannot go down the regular democratic paths since the nations will be at war with the Germans at the start of the game. Soviet Union runs out of Focuses fast. Germanys historical AI completes the Anti-Comintern pact and Army Innovations3 in 1936 start date but not 1939 start date. 12. Garrison Order. Boy is it a bit♥♥♥♥♥♥ If you played the game and seen what the Garrison AI does you know what I mean. The Main problem I have with it is port. Ports should be absolute top priority to any nation without Naval Superiority, as they allow for two front wars. the Garrison AI is really bad at holding ports, and I recommend any person playing this game to just use 1 province Fallback Orders to keep the ports secure. I could rant much more about this but its kinda boring topic.13. Paratroopers- The AI cannot use them as it is mentally challenged, even though you said it will attempt to.14. Special force limit. Just plain annoying.15. Fieldmarshals. The AI doesnt know how to promote them!!!Theres A LOT MORE I WOULD LOVE TO COMPLAIN ABOUT, but I have ran out of space.!!!--For the love of god Paradox please fix your AI- it is unbelievably stupid. I would pay for it as a DLC even just please improve it. Look at the mod Expert AI, that i how the base game AI should be, atleast on the higher difficulty levels instead of that boring worse production.

I found them too tedious, and honestly not very fun.I have never liked a HOI game... until this one.Hearts of Iron IV is a huge step up for the entire franchise.Trading is a breeze - simple chart on what is produced - too much of and what you need more of.Research is immersive - do I want to make Italy an air power, or achieve Mare Nostrum?Conflicts and battles are intuitive - you can manually change the doctrine multiple times during each battle.- On the overall map there are small color coded battle markers that tell if you are winning or losing (easy to give attention to the battles that matter while offering more time away from the battle interface)Easy to form theaters, armies, divisions; all while customizing with strategies and deciding where lines are drawn - color coded for simplicity.Realistic companies (eg. Fiat for Italian tanks; Baretta for small arms)Realistic machinery and accurate models.Less cluttered interface with important popups occuring every 5 minutes instead of 5 seconds.This game is far above any of the previous titles; I love it. It has reinstilled the WW2 fascination that I had when I was a kid.

Admiral Vag Master	Not Recommended	1,166.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/winstonbumhole/	*****This Review Is Formed After Hundreds Of Hours Of Gameplay******I LOVE Paradox. I have spent hundreds of pounds on Pardox games/DLC.BUT I strongly recommend AGAINST buying this game. I very rarely leave reviews but I think Paradox needs to be punished for its terrible terrible handling of this game.The game is actually a very bad game in its current form. It pains me to say it as I have previously recommended it to several friends who now also regret buying the game.Initially it is fun as you learn the game basics as it is actually a difficult game to learn to play (unless you have played previous HOI titles) but when you have learned how to play it you will find yourself becoming hugely frustrated at how lacking of in-depth content and challenge this game actually provides. At first the game appears to be very complex and tactical with its front lines and arrows pointing all over the place but you will soon find out that the basic mechanics are so broken and that the AI is so inept that you will find yourself drawing loads of complex strategies of conquest and defense that are completely useless. It is actually more efficiant to just draw one big frontline and an offensive line at the other end of the country youre attacking and grind though the entire country in one big ww1 style frontal assault. Even playing on the hardest game settings you will find yourself deliberately hindering yourself to stop the enemy AI being rolled too quickly and prolonging gameplay,When you get to a later game stage you will find yourself in a ww1 style confrontation with hundreds of allied/enemy divisions staring at each other BUT the AI is so stupid it constantly walks its divisions around leaving them with no organization which means (and i have actually done this many many many many times) you can assault a position with 2 well-constructed divisions against 3 or 4 enemy divisions and as the battle continues, the permenantly marching AI will walk into the attacking provence meaning that your 2 divisions will be facing over 100 enemy divisions and will win because the AI has pointlessly marched its divisions into exhaustion.The AI is also completely incapable of responding to what you are attacking them with and you will find yourself not needing to use the division designer at all.Paradox are starting to identify and are claiming to correct the problems I have mentioned (and there are many more. I have only mentioned the biggest) but they are claiming that they are releasing fixes (patches) in the form of DLC!This game is completely and utterly garbage in its current form. I sincerely mean it when I recommend that you do NOT buy this game in its current form. The game has a massively positive number of reviews and I can only conclude that those reviews have been left after only a few hours of gameplay when the game is only challenging because yo dont know how to play it.
Madame Gao	Not Recommended	227.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012216347/	Barebones game, expansions add practically no content. Ruined HOI franchise.
Swiss	Recommended	70.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/swisskies/	Definitely the most accessible HoI yet, and Paradox is finally learning how teach people their game through tooltips and tutorials rather than spend 3 hours looking at YouTube walkthroughs (hi HoI 3).The production system is simple yet elegant and offers a lot of choice on how your shape your nation, the focus trees allow you to customise how (a)historical you want to be and the first lot of hours in any playthrough are great fun.Few problems :  AI is a disaster at the moment and offers virtually no challenge.  I'm sure this will be fixed in future patches but the low base set means it will probably never be great AI.  The battle planner is also affected by the same issues.Feedback is pretty terrible - I have no idea how much attrition is happening in battles, what my bombers are bombing, how my fighters are faring (except to see how many each side loses each day).  Again something I'm hopeful of being fixed, but still a pain in my posterior hoop-ring.Late game is generally a chore, and the allied AI floods the front lines with mud cretin-tier unorganised peasant armies who can't push a front to save black jebus.If you can overlook these, definitely worth a buy.

Cuck Fuckleberg	Not Recommended	1,129.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bman0707/	Overpriced and incomplete, like every paradox game. That is the main reason why i suggest against buying this game, definatly not worth it unless its really cheap. Dont get me wrong, it is a fun game thats why i have over 500 hours, but without community content this game gets old and boring very quickly. The national focuses included in the base game are terrible, for historical accuracy and a-historical possibilities. The combat in this game is mediocre and unrealistic, and thats for all combat (land, sea, air). To me mods are the only thing keeping this game together and people who buy paradox's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ overpriced DLC.
Scrubby	Recommended	112.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ScrubbyBro/	This game is very good, except you need to watch a few tutorials on youtube on how some mechanics works, and understand it. otherwise a very well thought-out and built game, I reccomend starting out as Germany for starters. Graphics are pretty good, I do not prefer the music as i lesten to music on third party, and gameplay is very addicting.
»ε❤з» 🌺 Bex 🌷💕💋	Recommended	1,059.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RebeccaLovesGuildWars/	I am no fan of Paradox's criminal approach to DLC content, which is basically charging money to release a paid patch update that includes necessary base game features hidden behind a paywall, no company in existence should be allowed to get away with this immoral business approach of treating its fans as Paradox does. The game itself is a great war simulator, and all Paradox games have fantastic modding communities that are a real credit to the genre. Arguably a lot of the mods are more in-depth than the vanilla experience itself, yet the modders make absolutely no financial gain in doing so, but apparently Paradox need the DLC revenue just to be able to keep creating content, so make your own thoughts on that.... I strongly hope that Paradox scraps this immoral business approach in future games, and keeps expansions limited to things that actually expand upon the game ie a World War One expansion. A World War One expansion is something that would not be considered base game content, neither would a Cold War expansion be considered base game. However, the ability to convert out of date vehicles to newer technology is ESSENTIAL as a base game feature, and that is just one of many features that are hidden behind DLC paywalls advertised as Downloadable content, when infact they're necessities to a simple base game experience. Even EA or Creative Assembly are not this bad for hiding content behind DLC and that's saying something.Final thoughts: Gameplay 8/10 (some of my own suggestions of how gameplay could be improved would be adding Special Forces such as Commandos and greater peacetime content and espionage activities, all essential to a 20th century wargame and beyond), Artwork and Music 10/10, Immersion 8/10, DLC approach of hiding base game content behind paywall 0/10. Final Rating 6.5/10, would be higher if immoral business practices were removed, as you will need to spend significantly more than the base game cost if you want a complete base game experience.
SMURG	Not Recommended	283.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/smurgwastaken/	It strikes me that the team behind this game went to a lot of effort to research and consider the alternative paths history could have taken during WW2, implementing national focuses and government advisers such that the player can drive events down routes which history did not take but so easily could have.Then, they decided to make it so that the majority of these alternative paths are totally impossible due to game mechanics rather than historical conditions.For example, the UK has a path that allows intervention in the Benelux, a sort of pre-emptive strike before fascism can gain power or the Nazis invade - an interesting idea and one that may have been considered seriously by a British government other than that of Chamberlain. Unfortunately, this option is impossible to execute because it requires fascist sympathies above a certain level and the only way to boost this as the player is to convert to fascism yourself, and even if you do this it requires using the naval invasion mechanic which is basically useless until you research the second level transports. Since the second level takes literal years to research, inevitably the Benelux has been blitzkrieged by the time an intervention is even possible since Paradox opted to impose an arbitrary limit on the number of men who can be put into boats.Most of the national focuses available throughout the game have similar issues where they're utterly useless for mechanical reasons, and/or don't mesh at all well with how the game works despite being historically interesting. Going fascist as the UK is stupid enough as it is because your commonwealth allies inexplicably jump ship as soon as you do, despite King Edward VIII (who becomes leader) also being King in these places too. Then, because for some reason he gets -30% political power you can't even properly boost fascist sympathies in these places in order to reform the Allies as a new fascist commonwealth before you yourself get Blitzkrieged by Germany. France fares a little better since you start with a lot of communist pressure and can easily join the comintern and fend off the axis if you extend the maginot line, and I appreciate that historically the "go on the offensive" option on the national focus tree should be as stupid as it is. Equally there is a "go nationalist" option that allows you to join the axis and fight the other way. The "form the entente" option is a one way ticket to being anally♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by Germany in about 35 seconds flat, as is leaping to the aid of anyone in Europe - but again, this is reasonably historically accurate so it's okay. Also accurate is the way that if you ally with Britain they drag you into war with Germany before you can extend the maginot line and thus you get roundly beaten in true historically accurate fashion. Props to Paradox for that I suppose.Even Germany doesn't escape the useless national focus problem, since the game imposes arbitrary manpower restrictions on certain paths. You can go down the 'war with the USSR' option with no manpower requirement but you need 550k to pursue war with literally anyone else, meaning it's actually quicker and easier to simply justify war goals vs France or countries in Eastern Europe than it is to actually try and use the national focus tree - since for some bizarre reason it seems to encourage you to declare war on the USSR before you even take Poland. Obviously this would be a bad idea so rather than rushing Poland early whilst you have the advantage and before Britain or anyone else is forewarned into issuing guarantees, you're forced to languish in "no oil no factories no production" land for several years trying to produce 550k troops if you want to actually use the national focus tree. The alternative is to spend 10 months justifying war goals and just attack Poland that way, then simply ignore 60% of the national focus tree because as usual in this game it seems vast swathes of it are completely useless. I'd say that 0 consideration was given to a player who wants to attack earlier than Hitler, but Paradox include an achievement for getting both Poland and France to capitulate before 1939 so I'm left to assume that either the manpower requirement is added for pure sadism, or more likely the team in charge of developing this game didn't give much consideration to how the mechanics they were including would actually play out.I guess what I'm trying to say is that the game is very good if you want to play out WW2 as it actually happened. If you want to play as France and lose, the game makes this very easy. If you want to play as the UK and accomplish nothing but surviving the Nazi onslaught, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ naval invasion mechanics work in your favour. If you want to play as the US and spend the first half of the game languishing in economic micromanagement land, the game is happy to let you. If you want to slowly build up as Germany, slowly taking places one by one until eventually you end up in a full world war the game effectively railroads you along this path. If you want to explore alternative histories though (as anyone but France it seems), the game will resist you every step of the way - despite the deceptively enticing national focuses that encourage this.
RalphRoberts	Recommended	558.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198018884798/	A deep and rewarding strategy game that is, relative to most games on the market, hard to learn and chock full of features and mechanics that you might not even realize exist in your first playthrough or five.Play as any nation that existed during the run up to WW2, and even form some that didn't (Byzantine Empire or polish-lithuanian commonwealth, anyone?).Carefully manage your production, generals, army deployment, and air coverage, only to realize you forgot to build a navy. Instantly lose to 500 naval invasions happening simultaneously on every coastline in your nation even though you DO have a navy because you forgot to set them to patrol your coastline.Overall not a game for those looking for quick matches or a friendly multiplayer experience (it's only worth it when played with friends, don't do random matches). I've sunk many hours into conquering the world as the great state of greece or re-creating history as the UK.Highly recommended to those who enjoy longer games such as Civilization, or of course other paradox games.

I was going to give it a good rating, but the latest update ruined it for me. I do not like the buggy mess the game is in right now, and some of those bugs are game mechanics which don't make sense. Anyone may have a different opinion but I have decided on mine. If you are going to buy, wait untill the next update for some mechanics to be reworked and bugs to be squashed.

Thanos Rivaldo	Not Recommended	326.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198107995368/	Why are features that fix the base game and national focuses (which could easily be modded in btw) placed in DLCs?Nobody knows.Paradox's business practice is horrible and is slowly becoming EA (albeit the DLCs are fairly cheap but still not worth it relative to what they offer). Though the game itself is neat but somewhat lacking in content. Don't be fooled into thinking this game is complex, it isn't. Deep down its just a simple *produce/build/research more than the enemy, attack them* game with a bunch of witty features, and occasionally there are strategic/tactical elements. Strategic = Knowing what to build/produce, basically macro; Tactical = When to attack (Attacking as in the offensive actions you do in war, not the act of declaring war) and when to not, micro.If only steam could allow me to do an "Eh" recommendation. Basically, its a good game but the DLC policy needs to shape up.
Kubusta	Not Recommended	126.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kubusta/	As much as I would like to recommend this game, I simply cannot. The game in its current state DOES NOT deserve a recommendation and that is really sad for me - a great fan and loyal customer of Paradox.HOI IV at the start looks amazing. Graphics is beautiful, UI is pleasant and well arranged. Gameplay seems to be a little complicated but most players should have a feeling that they will get into it and they will soon manage the mechanics and will understand what to do and the game will be rewarding.HOWEVERunlike other games like Crusader Kings 2 or Europa Universalis IV the mechanics won't expand further and you will notice very soon that your actions are very limitied. There is literally NO diplomacy at all - all you can do by diplomatic relations is some mil. access, influencing others by your ideology, staging a coup and making an alliance - and that's it is for a 2nd WW game.When the War starts you will do some cool battle-plans, although later on you will realize that they are not working as you woud love to and all they do is a bonus for your troops. (so then you will usually drag one long battle-plan arrow and that's it)The game is REPETETIVE - unlike in EU IV (in my opinion) where you have different conditions with each nation, many achievements, religion etc.. here in HOI IV you ALWAYS do the same - start with same techs (in 90%), produce same units, build few buildings which are usuallyonly Civ/Mil factories and I could go on.. You might have fun at the start when you try different regimes - Fascist, Communists and Democrats, but after some time you will realize the differences are minor.TERRIBLE/HORRIBLE/INCREDIBLY STUPID AI - I played a lot of CK2/EU IV and I must say that AI here in HOI IV compared to the games mentioned is terrible. Thanks to that any singleplayer campaign IS NOT challenge at all. AI fails at everything from building proper units, buildings, securing their borders, evaluating the danger, fighting wars, using their planes and navy - Naval invasions is something that probably should not be in this game, because when you pick Albania (which is later Annexed by Italy via event) - if you pick Albania and refuse their annexation, Italy WILL FAIL to defeat your 2 provinces with 150 divisions when you will have 6-8. 150 VS 8 divisions FAIL - that is an incredible example of how the AI is horrible.Any major you pick (GB, Ger, USSR, USA etc) means no challenge. You can win the game in few years, just steamroll everyone cause the game is hilariously easy. If you decide to pick a hardest nation in the game - which should be (imo) Ethiopia, cause they start at war with Italy and they are being conquered - again, +- 100-150 divisions vs ur +-10 divisions --- you will defeat them. Yes, as Ethiopia you are going to defeat Italy, because they are unable to defeat you with more troops on YOUR land. And because there are no Peace Deals (only if you conquer everyone), you will be at war (as Ethiopia) many years even though Italy won't be able to naval invade you and they will fail every attempt of conquering you.I've read somewhere that someone's said that the AI is challenging - trust me, I am not any amazing strategist nor strategy player, but in this game there is no challenge at all. My last game as Spain, I conquered France in 4 months after the beginning of the WW and so in 1939 we had nothing to do (Axis), all we could do was spamming ships/planes to invade England later but that was it)As I've said already, the game DOES look amazingly at the start. I was convinced HOI IV will be amazing and great game, maybe the best and so I pre-ordered it for 90 euros - After +- 20 hours I realized how wrong I was..It has been NINE months after the release of this game and nothing has changed really. There is one DLC with interesting Focus trees but all in all it adds mechanics and stuff that SHOULD BE in a base game already and IS in other games PDX have (EU, CK). I love Paradox, I love CK/EU IV but HOI IV is a great disappointment. 
Rexz	Recommended	431.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198191005090/	One of the best Strategy games Iv'e ever played. There is so much to it, from politics to complex military strategies. There is so much, it's going to take you time to learn the game mechanics. But once you do, it all falls into place. The DLC's are what they are... DLC. You don't have to buy them, and most of the content that's part of the DLC's you can get through mods. But if you do they don't seem to be too overpriced and from a business standpoint it's understandable that they pump out these kind of dlc's to fund further developement of the game. I dig the game and can recommend it to others.
Metal Undivided	Not Recommended	206.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198060694214/	In a nutshell: the company that publishes/developes the game (Paradox) is getting painfuly close to EA/Ubisoft in how they run their business, if not even worse.Their DLC approach is absolutely atrocious. CK2/EU4 have both got a couple dozen DLCs over the years with a combined price of soon-to-hit-300$ - expect the same to happen to this game too.Besides that, Paradox has increased (up to 100% increase in some regions) prices in many regions without any announcement beforehand, right before the Steam Summer Sale 2017.If you're willing to throw some of your money away and are willing to indulge Paradox in their cupidity, go ahead. Otherwise, steer very well clear of any of their products, especially their Gra*DLC MISSING*egies.
Kaiser1871	Recommended	540.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thekaiser1871/	While many say the AI of this game has put them off (and it's mostly true), lots of fun can still be had with Hearts of Iron 4. With the 3 core ideologies, the alternate history opportunities are endless, from conquering China with a democratic Russia or uniting the Americas under a fascist Washington government. However, despite the possibilities of the vanilla game, the workshop is truly where HOI4 shines, showcasing thousands of amazing mods. There are alternate history total conversions like mine, a modern day mod, a truly spectacular WW1 mod (this is a must-have) and many others that change the vanilla game to suit your playstyle better. Despite its shortcomings Hearts of Iron 4 is in my opinion still a game worthy of positive attention.
Jazen	Not Recommended	477.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jazenmight/	The game is fun at moments. Positive: - New production system makes more sense than previous titles and seems to have a more lasting impact on gameplay - Focus trees are a nice mechanic to add flavor into the game. Can be restricting at times.  - Research is streamlined. - AI seems more accepting and willing to work with diplomacy - Being able to give clearer commands to automated troops - Variant units add flavor and can help make more impactful units - Most of the game is easy to understandNegative - Game appears overly easy, even on hardest difficulty, for veterans of the series. You can run the game on the highest speed and pretty much not miss anything impactful.  - Game seems to end much sooner than expected (WW2 ending in 40-41, focus tree exhausted early, tech only lasts till mids 40) - AI makes odd decisions to automated troops and in deciding how to fight the war. Several examples of troops being brought hundreds of kilometers away just to guard one side of the front while there are plenty of unused divisions nearby. AI also appears overly easy to "game" and thus mass encirclements become common (more-so due to AI mistakes than your own doing) - Country AI seems to refuse to follow-up and take provinces, leaving sprinkled enemy provinces everywhere. Not a pretty sight to see disjoint pockets of France, UK, Germany, Italy, Nationalist Spain, and United States all over North Africa.  - Incentive bonus to automate troops cripples manual control. Manual control is constantly overridden by AI control if you have the larger army set towards an objective. Controlling units should be other way around.  - War in Europe is decided by how many fighters you can build, and that's about it.  - Air Unit Interface is clunky and doesn't logically form well together (difference between airbase and air region) - Complete lack of meaningful espionage and ways to impact intelligence - No way to automate trade leading to constant "Lack of resource" popups. Should be able to set it so you can just get it from best source and save yourself two clicks every week in the later part of the game. (if there is a way to do this, I haven't found it yet) - UI and Map is a clash of color, hard to find units with the mess of units that are displayed on the screen with all the other things happening on screen. Needs patchwork. Wait and see on DLC filling out content before deciding to buy if you are on the fence. If you were a fan of HoI3, the game can feel like a let-down and too simple at times, so expect a different experience going in. More open to beginners and new fans of the genre. Would only recommend to players that are probably more open-minded in their expectations than I am.  
DF9	Not Recommended	219.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MLJudas/	I gotta say, I like this game. It's a lot of fun, especially if you have friends that own it that you can play with. It's a good game as is, but it could be god-tier if the devs would open their @#$^ing eyes and listen to what their customers actually want. I'm not going to do a full review but good god I just want paradox to do something about their DLC obsession. Christ on a bike have this game's features don't work right. Too much expensive, content-lacking DLC. They have a huge part of their community crying out for the broken parts of the game to be fixed and what do they do? Make more paid DLC. Come on, Paradox. Like the game (most of the time) but the developer... not so much. So much potential. So much. But it's squandered by the developers.
Senseo1990	Not Recommended	425.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/senseo1999999/	In its current state ("Sunflower" - Patch 1.2) Hearts of Iron IV is not enjoyable in singleplayer due to its broken AI.You can annex whole major nations with barely any resistance, when the AI decides not to use any troops to defend its own territory.This may (hopefully!) change in future builds, in which case I will change this review. The rest of the game is, in my opinion, enjoyable and well designed.

Helstrum	Not Recommended	152.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026837676/	I used to love every Paradox game, and then they went public, changed their DLC policy, and clearly overextended themselves. A Paradox game, in 2018, is no longer complete at launch. At launch, the game is in Early Access. Once two or three $20 DLCs are released, you can consider it in Alpha. After 5 or 6 $20 DLC, Beta. Once you're paying around $180 for a game and all of it's DLC, then it is complete. Maybe 3 years after launch. You may as well wait for this game and all of its DLC to get released, and then go on sale. Features that should be included in the base game, are locked behind DLC. DLC packs with limited content are still sold at $20. There are no more sales until years after release. It's a joke, and Paradox is basically milking all the customer loyalty they've developed. Sad.
Zeko Rena	Not Recommended	125.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zeko_rena/	I liked this game at first for quite some time, but as you learn more and get better you realise how broken this game really is, you can have three huge fleets in the English channel consisting of over five hundred ships, with over two thousand fighters and a thousand naval bombers supporting them, and yet the enemy can still sink your troop transports with ease (Denmark must have had a chronosphere for it's little tiny navy)Then you have stuff like you drop a little old nuke on a square with 18 infintry divisions and all they lose is a little bit of a supply, not one division is lost, you what now?A.I only seems to go so far as well before it just goes numb and does not know what to do, I  gave Italy and Germany full +50% bonus or whatever it is, and they smashed most of Europe, Germany took all of Russia, Italy took most of Southern Euorpe and half of South Africa, and then they stopped.They just ran out of scripts I guess with what to conquer, they just let Norway, Sweden, Denmark and Finland sit there, I ended up getting bored waiting for them to jusitfy against me (United Kingdom) so I went Fascist and started trying to invade other countries, but you get stuck with these weird "real historical ties" which prevented me from even trying to get Military access with Germany because of "reluctance" in 1952 when we are both Fascist lol.The paid DLC are a little dissapointing as well, they add good content for the tiny amount they add but most of it should be free in updates to be honest.Its a shame because for quite a while in my earlier days I enjoyed this game but it just gets too broken and has so many limitations put on it you can't really do what you want "You need to meet this, that, that, that, that, that and that objective to do this"♥♥♥♥♥♥off and just let me do what I want and I will suffer the consequences.EDIT: 22/11/2018 Will be interesting to see if this next DLC makes naval stuff a little less broken, but it has been saying coming soon for ages!
Deaston	Not Recommended	724.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004566322/	It's still broken. The A.I. will randomly move it's entire army from a major front. E.g. Germany will move it's entire army away from the eastern front. Guess what happens next? There are also other game breaking bugs like with Poland and the Molotov-Ribbentrop event firing even if Poland is a part of the axis. Until Paradox bothers to fix bugs like these I cannot recommend this game. It's a nice game, but the bugs are terrible and in some cases game breaking.
Dr. Strangelove	Not Recommended	48.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/strangelovedr/	I played every Paradox game since the very first Europa Universalis which was released in 2001. They were always quite unique and allowed you to play as virtually every country from the early medieval times, through the Victorian era, until WW2 and even beyond. I must admit, I only play them vanilla just after release, and this is, perhaps, what I like most about them - moddability.EU4 really becomes a whole different experience with MEIOU mod - it adds so much depth, amazing religious and development system, that it makes it impossible for me to ever return to the vanilla version, the same can be said about Hearts of Iron 3, which was a terrible game when it was released, but was improved a lot over the years by the BlackIce team, and through paying quite a bit for more and more DLCs. HoI 4 seems different. It has a lot of potential, but it is extremely lacking when compared to other games, both by Paradox and other developers.Hearts of Iron 2 and it's most modern... spin-off, I guess - Darkest Hour. DH is based on a game that was released in 2005, but with some new great features, like decisions. Decisions initiate events or chains of events, which means that you don't need to wait for an event to fire, you can do it yourself. This feature has a lot of potential and is used by modders to allow you greater control over your country. I must admit that I like Darkest Hour much more than HoI 4 because of its great mods that greatly expand the WW2, create a whole alternative universe of Kaiserreich when the Germans won the Great War, or let you play in the Fallout Universe. HoI 4 lacks proper events and by far feels less immersive than modded DH. National Focus could have well been done with a decision system like in Darkest Hour, that would also allow more choices.Hearts of Iron 3 was extremely disappointing when it was released, but still I get the feeling that this was a better game than HoI 4, and is much, much better when using BlackIce mod. In HoI 4 you don't have the chain-of-command system with divisions, corps, and armies, something I really liked, no releasable puppets or lend-lease (you have to pay a lot for them wiht their new DLC), no air units, just abstracted numbers on airfields, region system which I believe works worse than province one, and the AI is laughable. Admittedly, AI was always a problem, but HoI 4 gets the cake for the worst AI in my opinion.When compared to Gary Grigsby's games, it lacks its detailed units, careful attention to even minute historical details, well-researched equipment and units, and its AI, which is much more challenging than HoI 4 one. If you feel like a real grognard, try those instead, and devs constantly patch them even now, years after release, to make them even more accurate and fun. It doesn't allow you to build units, and you can't control every front - just East or West depending on the game, but the combat is way, way superior. When Compared to Decisive Campaigns: Barbarossa it really lacks its great immersion and hundreds of tough choices that you have to make as a person responsible for Barbarossa over the course of of several months. Hearts of Iron 4 is very similar to Stellaris in my opinion - it also lacks features when compared to some other games of its kind, and tries to be more casual, but the truth is - it can never be casual. I don't mean that it has to look like Microsoft Excel with nothing but statistics but oversimplification is equally bad - like no chain-of-command in HoI 4 (only armies now) and greatly simplified air units, very shallow politics with just 4 sides instead of many ideologies of previous games, odd trade where you are letting others use your factories for resources, and national focus instead of proper event chains or Darkest Hour-style decisions. This makes for a really shallow game for those used to older installments in the series.Overall, I can't say that I like HoI 4, even though I tried. Bought it on day one and was disappointed. Waites for patches and mods, but so far, even with BlackICE mod, it is still the worst Paradox game to date for me, maybe second-worst if you count oversimplified Stellaris. The only feature that I really love is equipment production which, when modded properly, will provide a lot of depth and a ground for many important choices, similar to those of real-life - do I produce more Panzer IV's which are easy to mass-produce, or will I switch for newer, better models, which will only be produced in greater numbers after a long time. Except for that, the game is not worth it.And for the end - Paradox DLC policy. The newest DLCs contains nothing but features that should have been included from day one. Lend-Lease? Puppets? Been there, done that, without having to pay for DLCs. It would have been really funny if it weren't so sad.
Resoula	Not Recommended	237.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Resoula/	Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJ2bQuMYOKcHearts of Iron 4 is a grand strategy game by Paradox interactive. It’s the long-awaited sequel to Hearts of Iron 3 which was easily one of the most in-depth grand strategy games ever made when it comes to raw military simulation with the organization of your fronts, front lines, second lines, and rear logistics.So let’s talk about gameplay. The bread and butter of any grand strategy game. Where does Hearts of Iron 4 improve? In production, easily. Hearts of Iron 4 features a very in-depth production system for your tools of war. You can dedicate factories to producing your tools which gain efficiency over time as the workers get used to creating that type of equipment. You can manually customize the strengths and weaknesses of the blueprints of your tanks which is a very interesting new feature. So you can either roll with default things off the historical research tree, or modify them to your liking. Lend-lease has been improved and now you can send aid to your allies directly instead of loaning them your industry power. In terms of war economics, this is one of the best Paradox games to date. Unfortunately resources in this game are static map-based control points which grant you access to production. This means there are no resource stockpiles, which is a very strange and regressive feature that sort of upsets how amazing war economy in this game is.The way actual war works is very strangely different from previous Hearts of Iron titles. No longer can you organize your lines of war in with the in-depth micromanagement that made this game series what it was. No longer can you really fortify a line with secondary lines to reinforce and third lines to pull back your injured divisions. Now you just stack divisions on top of each other endlessly in front lines that fight in battles limited only by the size of the battlefield itself. The good news is that with these changes and the addition of the macro-management system of drawing your front lines and your intended targets, the game is more accessible than ever in that what took plenty of strategic effort in the past is now accomplishable with two clicks of your mouse. Unfortunately, all the strategic depth to combat is also gone. There is no skill left in it other than the having the knowledge of how to create effective divisions and how to disperse them among your front lines. Air and Naval combat have overall been improved for the better, unlike the ground combat I’d say. They both work by assigning your fleets and wings to zones and giving them a specific type of goal to accomplish while in that zone. The only annoying thing there is that ship fleets have no cohesion whatsoever. The fastest ships engage first always and get slaughtered. There is no fleet strategy. You just need to hope you have the right amount and types of ships to win. Historical tech trees are gone. Those lovely things we had all around the board in Hearts of Iron 3? Only a very few specific major powers in this edition of Hearts of Iron have those. Historical events no longer play the biggest role as those nations now have focus trees as well which allow them to research events of their choosing. So Germany can now choose to have an event that creates a new faction between them and the Soviets, and certain countries can intentionally stray into an ahistorical path. The focus trees I feel are actual excellent additions to the series, but only the ones that are specific. The generic tree shared by most nations is boring, dull, and unnecessary. Graphics have been vastly improved, performance definitely better than hearts of iron 3 when it comes to a huge lack of memory leaks this time around. Unfortunately the game is filled with bugs that mostly plague modders and as a result leave many total conversions left incomplete. Internet connection to host seems only vaguely linked to internet speed. There’s a huge slowdown you can feel somewhere in between how Paradox connects its players and in matches with a lot of players you’ll find you have to play at turtle pace speeds because one can’t keep up.The biggest problem once you get past the complete downgrade of this game compared to its predecessor is that the base game is so bare bones and empty you’ll be wondering where the rest of the game ran off to. It was released incomplete and paid DLCs have barely added anything worth justifying the price of the original game let alone the price they want you to pay for the DLCs.Hearts of Iron 4 gets a 6/10 from me though. I had a lot of fun with it and it’s definitely an alright game. But it’s so bare bones it doesn’t deserve to hit any of my “good” ratings. This was a half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥casualization of a once in-depth and strategic game. If you are someone that is afraid of how complex grand strategy games are? Fear not. This is so simple a five year old could play it. But if you’re someone who wants substance to their grand strategy instead of “accessibility”? Look elsewhere.

rocketman3272001	Recommended	42.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142782174/	HOI4 is a dismal failure.As a pure gaming experience, it is overdone, overly complicated, and wrought with potential left unfulfilled. As an historical simulation, it is abysmally off-target and misdirected. And before anyone says, “It is only a game, get over yourself,” may I retort? First, and most importantly, anyone who would submit that HOI4 is not an historical simulation of the run-up and exposition of World War Two (1939-1945) is in deep, deep, denial. Every fiber of this game’s design is an attempt at historical relevancy. That it falls short is more a statement of today’s billion-dollar computer gaming industry than a statement about the dedication, industry, and skills of the HOI4 development team.Full disclosure: I am not generally a fan of Paradox Game design philosophy, although I own quite a few. I believe that their game designs often confuse ponderous and monotonous detail mechanics as a substitute for strategic and operational decision-making that leaders (read: players) should be making as a conscious decision to express the location of the player as the Man-in-the-Loop. Yet, I have put down hard currency for quite a few of their releases.I have been playing wargames for 57 years. I was Vice-President of R&D for the Avalon Hill Game Company in the 1970s and a game designer for the Department of Defense in the 1980s. I was an original founder of the Game Designer’s Guild in the 1970s. I have designed many games and quite a few successful historical simulations. I have been a student of the game design process for many years. My thesis is basically this: There is little or no difference between the elements of successful design in a board wargame and a computer wargame. The only difference is that the capabilities of a computer allow for automation of logistical bookkeeping, hidden movement, fog of war, and simultaneous movement. At its heart, however, good game design is good game design, apart and separate from coding, simulation engine design, and artificial intelligence.HOI4 is a wargame. If you think it is not, you are either much younger than I (by half a century) with a very narrow experiential base or very pedestrian in your philosophical concept of what constitutes a “game.” As such, it is a failure. But, bear with me as I explain:I have invested more than 40 hours into a game that I want so badly to succeed. I love the dedication of the development team. I think the portrait graphics are stunning. I am entranced by the sprite animations that absolutely infest the Graphical User Interface, GUI, (“game space,” to the literalists). The development and technology mechanism is challenging and first rate. Unfortunately, the historicity or “What If” potential of the “front end” build-up of the 1936 scenarios is wasted when the AI and the player finally go to war. What ensues is wild science fiction and not “What If” historical possibility.Exhibit A: I am the Brits in the 1936 scenarios (by far the most interesting). I reconstruct an historical development track aimed at the eventual replay of radar, Spitfire, BEF, Dunkirk, and defense of the home island. Pointless. When war finally erupts in June, 1939, the ITALIAN Army successfully invades southern England by sea and air owing to ITALIAN and German air superiority over the English Channel (to which the Spitfire-rich RAF and the robust Royal Navy appear totally impotent). To top it off, that same ITALIAN Army (who historically lost 250,000 men to Gen. O’Connor’s Western Desert Force approximately one-fifth its size) destroys the Royal Navy's Eastern Med fleet and the British Army in the Middle East, eliminates a significant RAF contingent (without having any aircraft carriers!), and invades the Nile Delta, captures the Suez Canal, and takes Jerusalem. What is WRONG with this picture?Exhibit B: I am the German side in another 1936 scenario. I follow an historical blitzkrieg buildup. I avoid a Poland War option and watch the Russians and Poles form an early alliance. By the time war breaks out in June, 1940, 170 Polish and German divisions pour across the frontier and destroy the panzer-infused Wehrmacht within DAYS. What is WRONG with this picture?Exhibit C: I try the Germans again, this time in the 1939 scenario to test whether the fault lies with the long R&D and build-up mechanics of 1936 or the AI. I aggressively follow the “kill Poland” national focus, develop a powerful tactical Luftwaffe and bleeding edge panzer and mechanized divisions. When the balloon finally goes up in August, 1939, the Luftwaffe loses badly (“You have lost Air Superiority over Eastern Germany”) to the Polskie Siły Powietrzne, armed with the obsolete PZL P.11 air superiority fighters. Meanwhile, the Polish Army is kicking butt. What is CRAZY wrong with this picture?At first, I thought the problem is with the HOI4 game system’s artificial intelligence algorithms. A truly effective AI would be able to construct “event gates” to corral the movement, resources, and combat outcomes to conform to certain specific event horizons. Combat effectiveness is clearly suspect. The AI seems much too productive and powerful. But, after further play, I am simply not sure. The AI is clearly failing, but it is not clear as to why it falls so short. Are other game  mechanics at play to a lesser or greater extent to distort historical possible outcomes?As good as the national focus, R&D, production, GUI, and resource features appear to work in the 1936 scenarios, the game system, as a whole, falls flat when it comes to producing even vaguely probable outcomes when the fighting starts. It appears that our code-crunching development team has only the most superficial familiarity with historical reality. Trust me, if the simulation game mechanics cannot produce a facsimile of actual history, the designers have missed the mark.It may appear that I am unduly harsh, but this critique needs to be stated. I think the development team is doing some awfully nice things in HOI4--a definite improvement over HOI3. They clearly have dedication, heart, and skin in the game. But, it is all too easy in the Computer Age to forget that the long-term value of any game is its DESIGN, not its mechanical implementation. Code-writing is implementation. Concept, mechanics, and outcomes are the soul of DESIGN. HOI4 implementation is currently a failure. BUT, it is a magnificent failure.My ancient recommendation to the development team is this: Read more WW2 history and, more importantly, incisive and deep historical analysis (Wikipedia is NOT your friend). Seriously evaluate the effectiveness of the AI. Stop with the over-priced and under-valued DLC add-ons: you are putting lipstick on a pig that will never cure the underlying flaws of the AI. Then, take a deep breath and carefully consider how the design could more closely align itself with history. Next, TEST it for its approximation to historical events. Finally, release HOI5 to high praise and adulation from your peers and dedicated fans. And me!

The AI command is not very efficient, and often dumb.- Air force generals do not exist.Other than that I still like the game and will try again in a few months and hope it would be improved and fun, and if so will happily write a positive review.

Liberation	Not Recommended	110.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098795061/	TLDR: Fantastic grand strategy title for WW2 era. Not a good HoI game.When I first got to writing my review in Word I never thought I would run out of space for this here Steam review tool. I therefore redirect you to the following link where you will be able to read my seven page review for this game.http://theflax.squarespace.com/maxs-corner/It is long but I think I make my point crystal clear and outline well the pros and the cons of this game, which is not bad in itself.I am a veteran HoI player. I have played every single HoI title from the very first one to HoI2 and its doomsday:Arma expansions. I have played 3 and I have played the excellent fan made AoD (Arsenal of Democracy) and DH (Darkest Hour). I am very familiar with the mechanics of every one and humbly believe I am in a good position to write a competent review which I hope will guide you in your decision to buy this game...or not.
TheKraken	Not Recommended	614.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059815424/	As much as I love the Hearts of Iron series and almost every Paradox game I cannot recommend this to anyone in its current state. The game compared to prior versions of Hearts of Iron, or many Paradox grand strategy games, has been simplifed to the point where it is no longer fun or interesting.  It has none of the replayabily of other titles like Crusader Kings, EU, or Victoria 2. However, replayabilty is just one major problem among many.The biggest problem is the AI, which is probably the worst I have ever seen in a game like this in ages. It cannot manage its own forces, build anything, and generally just spits out waves of infanty and fighters. The AI cannot handle what they want it to do, which includes basic production of war goods. This game was delayed for over a year and this is what they thought of as releasable, which is nothing more than a paid alpha. While the AI is bad, the most damning thing is the design decisions made in this game. The UI is a mess, constantly clicking through multiple widows to seach for the most basic info. Just to find out the size of your army is hidden in a non-descript number behind a force summary. Information is hard to come by and often just never presented to you until after you notice a huge disaster. This games economic content in its current state is a huge disaster of its own. It has none of the depth or fun of Darkest Hour, which game players extreme amounts of choices and options. Everything is based off of resources and basically two factory types: civilian and military. All of which the AI can't manange. There is no comprehensive diplomacy or espionage system, which I assume was but for a paid DLC later. Ultimately, this game is a cash grab. Ton's of content missing and bad design decisions that they pass to the modding community to fix and add content for. Everything else will be behind pay walls of DLC which will undoubtably have packs for indvidual countries and content that was just considered part of the game in previous versions.
Pizzaspy	Not Recommended	85.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999483447/	There are some great ideas here, like the new production system. Ultimately though, it disappoints due to factors such as horrible AI and a clunky battle plan system which you spend more time fighting with than the enemy.Beyond that I have soured on Paradox as a company due to: the sluggish pace of support post launch, the shameless use of DLC to fix the fundamentals, and refusal to even aknowledge the AI problem. Read between the lines: it's never going to be fixed. They are going to fiddle with config values and dangle the carrot of it being fixed each DLC, but never deal with it on a fundamental level. All the cool focus trees in the world cannot make the game fun when the AI can't even do the basics.
KaanBabaBurda	Recommended	758.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030031049/	Well I admit,in this state of game,it is easy compared to Hoi 3. I don't agree to people,preferring Hoi 3 to Hoi 4 though.Because managing your whole army one by one,is a true pain in your a**. I was having headaches because of the army management in Hoi 3. It has great opportunities to play as minor countries too. So to sum it;Pros ;- Easy army management- Great animations (land,sea,air)-  Details ( logistics,supllies,etc)- High replayability-  Polish DLC ( and maybe others to come,beacause of their uniqueness)- Tons of modsCons ;- AI is way too easy (for minor countries too)- Some minor bugs  about battleplans- Needs more content for minor countries ( which i believe,will  come with dlc's or mods )- That music in Allies faction ( with woman singing and killing me with boredom )If you like WW2 and you are a fan of grand strategy,this would be a great game for you 9/10
Schneeflocke	Not Recommended	424.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198028881721/	One thing: the game itself is quite ok.But!:In this game are a few game breaker. Its hard to see where your Divisions are in the mid/late game when whole Frontlines are just a colorfull mess.I ate some Toast this morning, and it could tell me more about tactic, than the ai in this game.Next negativ thin, which changes this to a negativ: the DLC politic. Instead of fixing major bug, exploits or the ai, DLC's are sold. You have to buy the DLC's because there are game functions in it, without them its not really easy to play. The rest o the DLC is less then some mods.If you have the endurance -> buy HOI 3, learn it (there are plenty good tutorials, you just have to keep up. Dont give up!). It has its failures too, but its a better game than Hoi 4 ( if you are here for gameplay, not for bright, colorful graphics)
BNS Marko	Not Recommended	364.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/markalone/	After 170 hours I can say this game is definetly NOT worth it. Now the reasons for that are many, I'll try to sum it up:1. This game suffers from an extreme repetition syndrome. You'll find that in any game, any situation, any mod or setting you play it'll always go down the same way. You start with a buildup of your forces and buildup of your country. For me, that's one of the few interesting parts of the game. Then, the war you wished for is declared, and your first new victories are exciting. After a while, it turns into a steam roll and you have to stare at your screen waiting for it all to end. That's it, that's the whole game, once it turns into an inevitable victory all you have to do is stare and watch. Except for when you have to deal with braindead AI trying to naval invade you all over the place with the 1 unit you will beat anyway, but you still have to pause the game and bother dealing with that 1 unit. Over and over and over and over and over.2. The war until complete capitulation is extremely stupid.Every campaign you do in which you are not the United States will go down the same way. You'll fight 30 countries, make them all capitulate and leave them in ruins but surprise surprise, the US is the 31th country you're fighting. And even though they can't do a successful invasion on you, you can't do a successful invasion on them without waiting for a few years to produce enough ships or whatever. So now, because there's no peace offering system like in other grand strategies, you have to once again keep staring at your screen, waiting for that production to do something and invade the US. Inevitably, you'll succeed in it; but again, you had to waste time and wait for it. 3. The horrendous cash grabbing DLC policy strikes again!Completely outrageous and the main reason why this will be the last Paradox grand strategy title I will buy. Ridicolous prices for underwhelming DLCs while the main game is rampant with bugs and issues.

Nacho	Not Recommended	29.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mquaritch/	Being a big fan of Paradox grand strategy games in general and HoI since Hearts of Iron II, I bought this game plenty of expectations. However I have to say that I've been quite disappointed. Not only because it is, compared to other games from Paradox like Europa Universalies IV, Crusader Kings II or Victoria II, much simpler. But also because it is much more silly than the previous versions of the very Hearts of Iron. I've been playing thousands of hours to all Paradox's games and hundreds of hours Hearts of Iron II and III over more than a decade. Hearts of Iron III was a great improvement over HoI2. When HoI4 was announced I really expected the next step in the same path of Europa Universalis, being more complex and controlling more and more aspects of the management of a country with all their unseen interactions. But sadly Hearts of Iron 4 has gone in the opposite direction.Of course I wouldn't expect to have Religious, Burgers and Nobility estates, but I expected some more complexity in the overall game. Money is not existing. Economy in general is not existing. Politics is almost nonexistent. Technology is quite straight forward. You have very little to do apart from driving your armies to the front. As an example, the game engine is made so simple and silly that they had to force Spanish Republic to be communist dictatorship (what never happened) just to allow the AI playing the USSR bring aid and volunteers to Spain. That's the level of silliness. Yes, you may not care if you never play Spain, but that's gives you an idea on how much the game engine has been simplified.I wouldn't be exaggerated if I say that It is basically a fancier version of Civilization. Timeline events are non existing, you have some goals that drive you through the game but it is light years away from the amazing and captivating complexity and replayability of Europa Universalis IV, or even Hearts of Iron II or III. To be honest, if Europa Universalis IV was chess, Hearts of Iron IV is tic-tac-toe.Some people would say that it is simpler to play, easier to play. That's true. But if I wanted to play silly strategy I would play Age of Empires or Civilization. If I liked all Paradox's games was, particularly because of the challenge they implied to be learnt and mastered. Because every play was different than any other even choosing the same nation. And I feel that HoI4 is deeply diminished in this aspect. Maybe Paradox Games has become a mainstream studios focused only in revenue and profit, and the last game that was really worth it was Europa Universalis 4. If this is the way they're going to do Victoria III, probably I won't fall in the trap of buying it. And yes, some may say that we should wait until all the money-squeezing DLCs are released. But then any buyer should wait until the game is "complete" and it can be purchased for an affordable price according to what it is. Let's stop this spree of releasing unfinished, unbalanced games for the price of what used to be a complete game.
Tranenturm	Not Recommended	395.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198067674307/	Updated for Waking the Tiger:Original Review:So when I was first checking out Hearts of Iron IV I heard about the bad AI and such but thought, "its on sale, why not?"  Having played HOI2 and HOI3 plus many of their other games I figured the AI can't be THAT bad.  Surely there's a playable game somewhere?So I start with Italy doing some Italy 36 scenarios restarting a bunch as I learn the system.  Tech is fine, I like the new resource management (less fidly than HOI3), and even the Army management is good for less important fronts.  No, the computer doesn't really know anything about tactics other than forwards, or back.  But that's been true for earlier releases.  Annoying, but not game stopping.On one of the playthroughs where I got to wars start, in Septemeber of 39 I did a verticle envelopment of French troops in the alps dropping paratroopers behind the enemy to cut supplies and retreats.  It was messy, but successful.  Germany wins in the North and then the Vichy event triggers preventing me from aquireing almost all of my gains.  Okay, I can see the hard script to handle a fairly peculiar feature of WWII.  Next time I just won't declare till after france falls.  I start it up, go the Italy First route and take Greece then Yugoslavia, intentionally waiting on Yugoslavia for Sept of 39 so that the Allies will think twice aboout starting war with a different faction.  They don't protect, and I steamroll Yugoslavia.  Only, France is still up.  They have a single division on our border.  Germany hasn't taken anything.  It's declared on Benelux, Denmark, and Norway, and taken NOTHING.  With Denmark, I don't mean that it gets stuck taking Copenhagen.  I mean it doesn't even get the peninsula.  The German Reich can't take down Belgium or Netherlands.  It MIGHT have taken Luxemburg.  Okay, so maybe the game is flawed and meant really just to be played 1 player as Germany.  Clearly you can't trust the AI to be remotely competent as the main aggressor, so just be the main aggressor.I do a couple of warm up Germany 36 starts, then start my real one.  My goal is to build up the Germany Navy and attempt a legitimate Sea Lion.  No cheesy suprise landings, massive paradrops or other.  Win control of the high seas in a "fair" way.  But first I need to defeat France and take their Navy out of the way.  Poland gets taken quickly, but instead of the immediate switch of fronts, I decide to get the extra research slot first.  I'll try to invade France in December.  I set up a fairly standard assualt through Benelux with fast armor units, paradrops, and so forth.  France has been severly testing my Western wall which has 24 Divisions of standard '36 infantry defending it.  They almost get through a couple times so I'm keeping an eye on it while I wait for the Focuses to finally let me into Benelux.Italy had joined the war day 1 (I hate when they do that as their fleet will get butchered by England and France together, but I was to afraid a refusing them might mean I coudn't invite them later).  The Italian AI is actually giving the French a run for their money in the south.  At which point I notice France has stopped attacking the Western Wall.  So I look a little closer, and I don't see the French units.  Thinking this might be a display thing, I order some units to take the Maginot line.  Which they do.  Uncontested.  France pulled out ALL units from the Maginot line with 24 German divisions sitting across from it and no war going on in Benelux.  They let me walk in.  Not even a single division to keep up appearances.Sure, the French AI probably registered the Italian thrust as needing some reinforcements.  Great!  But the Maginot was no where close to being flanked and cut off.  The Italians had Marseiles.  I don't think they had even crossed the river there. The French GAVE ME THE MAGINOT LINE.  That's how bad this AI is.Update for 1.5.1 with expansions:I really want to like this game which makes it all the more frustrating.  I haven't been playing Germany so no update on whether or not the Maginot line issue has been fixed.  But the AI still launches pointless charges into your lines and pursues them to the bitter end even when they have zero chance of winning and it hurts their long term interest as well.  And I don't mean 40/60 fights, I mean 5/95 fights.  A waste of digital lives.But that's not all.  It could be overlooked if in the composite things balanced out.  But it doesn't.  Germany often stalls in Barbarossa without getting past Poland, out of material and low on manpower.  It also means that if the Italians don't get into the fight vs the French, the Germans often don't even take France.But that's not enough to make a horrible game.  Instead once multiple countries on different sides get involved, peace treaties end up a total mess.  Not just for Vichy, but for pretty much any multisided engagement.  There is not respect for forces on the ground.  Territories can be taken from an occupying army without consent due to internal oddities in how the war got "put together".  Civil wars are particularly bad in this regard.And thats when the system is working as designed.  Multiple bugs are still rampant.  I won as National China vs Japan.  But during the fight Japan declared war on Communist China even though they were no where nearby.  I was not in alliance with CC so they join the Commitern and pull the USSR into it.  This colosally bad move on the part of the Japanese isn't the problem.  I had cut the Japanese forces off at Beijing and trapped a large portion of their troops.  I raced the Soviets and beat them to the best parts of Manchuria and Korea.  As the Soviets progressed, some territory was shown under their control, other parts under communist china control.  Whe I latter attaced and quickly beat Communist China, their manchurian territory was given to me on the map, but the Soviets still controlled and profitted from the industry there.  They were listed as controller.  I was going to have to go to war with the Soviets to "win" territory I already controlled...Other bugs include weird colors popping up at different times and the need to restart the program when different visuals decide to go wonky.But then some other this is still workable, until you dig a little deeper.  The air war has bad modelling with air superiority.  The naval modelling is extremely bad.  The AI will never research new ships or naval doctrines, making the solo naval game super easy once the player researches just a few tech.  In addition, submarine warfare seems to make no sense at all.  The UI is neither intuitive nor truly useful.  Naval Battles can last an extremely long time.  Once engaged they seem to include 100% knowledge of opponents force location with no fog of war.  (They are all simulated anyway with no imput from the player at all except for attempting to retreat your forces out).  These super battles seem to draw in ALL forces in the area, even those it makes no sense to.  Subs seem to be incredibly underpowered, partially because the AI knows their location once found.  I hvent done multiplayer, but the people testing optimal flee configurations report that pure battleship or pure Carrier fleets (no screens at all) are the optimal configuration, even apparently vs subs.  So the modeling is bad and the composite result is bad.So the game is mediocre to poor if you play a mostly land fight in Europe, Asia or Africa and utterly attrocious once peace deals and naval are factored in.  I really wsnt to like this game, but its just soo bad.

Nikke	Recommended	1,317.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JokuKaale/	Hearts of Iron IV is the first Paradox game I have owned. I absolutely love this game, it keeps on giving more and more cool DLC's and the Workshop mods are the best part about the game. Without mods the game is good and simple, but when you download mods you can personalize the game to suit you. If you want your game to have cool realistic portraits of leaders, you can. If you want your game to look like ♥♥♥♥ing anime, you can. And those are just two examples of what you can do with mods. The game is very easy to learn in my opinion, just play the tutorial and you are ready to go. Even while i have almost 1000h in the game, i havent played every nation in the game. Its a great game and I highly recommend it, you are not gonna get bored.Beware!: The game starts having fps issues in around 1941, Its because of the amount of divisions every one has,I suggest getting the: No AI unit spam mod. But the fps is still a issue, but the mod help's.Great Game 10/10
Karl Franz-kun-chan-senpai-baka	Not Recommended	208.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JustADerpyName/	Following the latest Dev Diary, I cannotrecommend this game.I tend to enjoy PDS games a lot, I own and played a lot of EUIII & IV, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 2, Darkest Hour & Hearts of Iron 3, Stellaris, Crusader Kings 2, but now I regret buying their latest Hearts of Iron title.Although the game is fun at its core and I greatly enjoy some of the changes they have made (I quite like the way production works now, as well as the division designer), the game still feels unfinished, unpolished and the AI is laughably bad. There is the still very common issue of the AI sending all their troops to Africa, and some other cases such as Germany being on the verge of defeating Poland and suddenly shifting their attention to the West and moving almost all of their divisions to invade Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Belgium despite it being late 1939 and the historical focus being activated, leading Poland to regain much of their lost territory and for Germany to get stuck in a two fronts war, or three if Britain decides to launch a Naval Invasion in Wilhelmshaven because they do that all the time and the AI is unable to protect their coastal provinces. There is also the issue of France leaving their border with Italy completely undefended and being steam rolled in a few weeks. The Pacific War is also inexistent if you play with the AI. The game was released back in June, mind you. Now they are planning to release a DLC next instead of another patch to fix those lingering issues. In general, this is not something that bothers me too much, as with DLCs they release rather large patches that often add new content as well. However one of the DLC’s said feature is something that should have been in at the game’s release or added as a free quality of life improvement. That ‘feature’ is the Blitz option to the battle planner, which is essentially an attack option where the selected units who are given that order will attempt to break through the enemy lines through the territories you have selected, allowing an easy method of performing encirclements or even to rush and try to capture strategically significant provinces.You can certainly do that manually, as I have done it plenty of time, but the reason why they have added the battle planner at all is to minimize micromanagement. An option such as ‘Blitz’ should be an essential, but as of now, the only option for attacking that we have is to either let the battle planner act like it is World War 1 or micromanage the divisions you want to perform breakthroughs with. It is certainly something that I felt was missing while playing the game and I am certain many others feel this way, and it goes way back to when they first showed the battle planner and people were asking if they could perform more complex manoeuvres with it.Now, the details about the upcoming DLC are rather scarce, with only one Dev Diary out. But what I have read is enough to make me suspicious about the future of Hearts of Iron IV. I may change my review later on, if I feel the game has improved enough to warrant it (with or without the DLC).But for now, I definitely do not recommend this game, not when both Hearts of Iron 3 and Hearts of Iron 2: Darkest Hour is far more complete, polished and interesting games with plenty of mod support to customize your playthroughs.

They are basicallyall the same and have the same faults!Pro's:The game looks good...worked out of the box with no problems. It has only crashed twiceusing a MOD [Blackice - which is fab by the way!] because other MODS were incompatible.There is plenty to do at the start...it has been dumbed down a bit from HOI3 but I think itis better.You can play multiplayer....but can be hard to find people to play with as most need a password or have different MOD's/versions.Con's:The AI is terrible! DO NOT trust it to do your wars completely [unless it is against a smallcountry or you have masses of troops]. It keeps moving your troops around from one endof the front to another for no reason. It should use nearby troops instead. Sometimes it willsend some troops from a port to another front [using up convoys] not connected to their allocated front. I have seen AI France move 95% of it's troops from my border [Germany] to the Italian border! [because Italy was at war with Yugoslavia].It won't send invasions because it thinks it's too dangerous [when your fleet is there!]. It isa war....it will be dangerous! lolToo many planes are made...I had 250k build by 1945 [I did conquer most of the world by then], but even my apponents had 50k. The zones are way to big, so most airports are ineffective.The supply issue is a major bind with me! I had 15 Philippine Divisions cornered in NE Borneo. They had no port, but they had no supply penalties, but I did when I had all 4! Even attackingAmerica, you have no control to which port in a region supplies are sent to, so you divisionsloose organisation and then the AI beats you! They do not suffer the same problem at thesame time - with no buffs]. There should be an option to swith it off like in HOI3. If it isrealistic then ok but give us the choice.As with all paradox games now [and other companies too], game is open to loads of dlc'swhich will fleece the fan. It's all about screwing us in this world [banks/utilities/politicians andgaming companies!]. The first 'expansion pass' is the same price as the original game I notice!I advise you to wait for the 'Gold/Platinum/Complete' version or a sale!I will still play it though, I prefer the build-up, but the mid-end game is so tedious and repetative[having to micro all the provinces in big country wars].I give it a 5/10. Would be a yes....maybe in the future.December 2016.........As I predicted, a dlc is out and it's rubbish adding bare minimum content [which should already be there] at a typically extortionate price from this gaming group paradox. I would ONLY buy their stuff in a sale and as a 'complete' set if you want it. Avoid them and just use mods instead! But the sheep will buy it.....enjoy then! Ha haNow my rating has gone down to 4/10.Feb 2017 Update:  Play as Germany, researched nuclear weapons. The game freezes for asecond then changes the game......my ally [who is fascist] Finnland changes sides to allies[when they were at war with allies]. Suddenly all enemies stats are buffed way higher thanmine. Totaly crap AI...absolutely useless! Practically impossibe to join other games inmultiplayer as they always have different versions!Rating now 3.5/10June28, 2018.  Rating 1.5/10paradox are scum. Now saved games don't work because they updated it. Can't even stop udates. Worthless criminal company ONLY here to screw us out of money! I bought 2 dlc's ina sale today but NEVER again!
Marsh	Recommended	138.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarshHagFilly/	I was wrong about this game. I first got it in December and played it for only an hour and returned it. I returned it because it felt like it was too complicated for me to understand. Just a day ago I decided to get it again and give it another chance, and I'm glad I did. I'm still learning how to play HOI4 and so far, its really fun!I rarely post reviews but HOI4 is an exception. HOI4 deserves a positive review, this game allows me to enact my own alternate history WW2 scenarios and I'm glad this game exists, thank you Paradox for making this game. As I said before, I am still learning how to play, but once I do, it will add an even more fun experience.Overall, I will give this game a 9/10

Kaspar	Not Recommended	238.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197968780625/	I really want to like this game. It ought to have been the greatest WWII game yet, following in the footsteps of HoI2 and HoI3.I've spent a lot of time trying to like this game. But even a year after release, the AI is simply broken, and presents far less of a challenge than in HoI3. Aggravating this, the devs are pretty much forcing you to turn over control of your troops to the broken AI, by taking away the interface elements from HoI3 that were needed to control your armies manually.The supply system is poorly designed. The most effective way to deal with supply issues, is to advance further into enemy territory, as this will spread your divisions over more supply zones. One wonders what the design goals of the supply system were.Historical plausibility has been sacrificed on the altar of "lets make every country fun to play". End result is that Nepal can conquer the world with nukes...The good part is that the equiment and production systems are great. But without a functioning game to use them in, there is little point.

willum.pauline	Not Recommended	324.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048614664/	This could have been a brilliant game. The politics, industry, resources and research are all handed really well, although some of the larger minor states should really be more developed than pre-first world war. Yes, it has a steep learning curve, and for some of the major countries, the politics can be a little restrictive, but that doesn't stop it being a bad game. The problem really starts with the number of units that seem to miraculously appear when war starts and how army sizes are disproportionate in size to both the historical reality and as to whether it you as the player controlling that country or the AI. As an example, after the fall of France the Free French Army was created, This initially consisted of one light division based in North Africa and by 1944 had increased to four divisons spread across the West European and Italian fronts. In the game, within days of France falling, the Free French have a larger army in North Africa than either the British or the Italians and within months are invading Italy with armies totalling 30-40 divisions. The same can be true of both the United States and the UK, unless you are playing as one of those nationalities and then it is much harder to recruit. This isn't a gripe about the strength of th allies as I played as the UK very successfully but with a much smaller  but more realistically sized army than the AI gets, although I had to micro manage every battle, which brings me to my next gripe the AI during combat. Why don't the armies ever do what you've asked them to do unless you micro manage? Why if you are allowed to move troops through a neighbouring country under a troop movement treaty, are you then unable to attack from those countries? Napoleon used to do it even if he didn't have a treaty. Instead when you try to move your troops into enemy territory to enable a flank or encirclement, they don't take the direct route but instead march back to your country and the then try and move through the front line, where you are successfully pinning your enemies forces ready for the manouevre that is never going to happen, by which time the enemy forces have miraculously tripled in number. I have been playing wargames with miniatures and  board games and then on computers for almost 50 years, and I have to say that the AI and unit spawning breaks this game more than nearly every other game I have played. I haven't even mentioned the disappearing armies - I played as a facist Holland, joined the axis, kept my army in reserve and only commited my airforce during the attack on Belgium and France. After the fall of France, I was given all the territory in Belgium and France but my army had disappeared so I had no troops to defend my coast from the immediate invasion by 30+ divisions from the UK. Just one of a number of bugs I have come across. Disappointed to have spent so much time learning to play a game that is broken and doesn't look like being fixed.
ortizkiwi	Not Recommended	313.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ortizkiwi/	This is my first review that I am aware of. If this is your first time playing a HOI game, then you should be happy with it. It's interesting and you will invest a lot of hours into it.However, if you have any of the previous HOI's, this game is a joke. Once again, publishers feel they need to dumb down games in order to make more money. This HOI is incredibly simplistic and takes away a lot of the fabulous complexity in previous versions that made the game stand out. Research is simple and visually looks stupid with the fat buttons to make sure you follow the obvious linear trees. By 1944 in my first game, I had all national focuses, and 90% of technologies filled. The AI is dumb and very direct. They removed the complex diplomatic/intelligence structure. Warfare is simplistic with the front system, although some of it was interesting. I quickly ran out of generals, only to find out as I "bought" new ones, the same face pic came up for several of the generals. I had 4 with the same face. Why do you buy generals with diplomatic experience versus army/navy/air experience? I had 400 army experience, and could not use it for anything really. I didn't want to create a new template, so it just went to waste. You should be able to use it to get generals, improve technology speed, get combat bonuses, etc. No air commanders??I did like the way they designed Air combat. I thought overall it was better than the cumbersome air system from previous versions.Verdict. I am giving it a negative review based on my experience playing previous versions. If taken without any previous knowledge, the game would be enjoyable.
Astro	Not Recommended	189.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kennedy-Shot-First/	Its a really fun game I've put over a hundred hours into, and I love Paradox games in general, they've made me fall in love with grand strategy games, but their DLC model is horrible, the price you have to pay for the very few features it adds is too high, it's as if everytime someone over at paradox comes up with 1 good feature to add they make a dlc out of it, and these price hikes that are coming out for some people really bothers me. I came here to buy Death or Dishonor when I saw the recent reviews, and I think all hold off on my purchase until they go on sale or the least likely option, Paradox makes a sane move and gets their♥♥♥♥♥♥together. Either add a lot more stuff to the DLC or lower the price. The content you put out is amazing, but the way you put it out is just abusive to your fans

offff	Not Recommended	663.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xXBenisXx/	Not your average lol so random bullet point meme review.Update: I have been playing a lot, altough there is still a bunch of holes the AI keeps digging itself in, it improved. They at least try to do naval invasions try to evacuate (by land, they still don't understand that they can sail away if the whole german nation is on ford pickups racing twords them) when they are cornered. The DLC is really upsetting. The features like puppet system and equipment licencing probably took them a week on a whiteboard and 2 days for the intern to code in Lua. The focus trees in the first DLC was kind of allright, it had some signs of creativity with things like liberation of African peoples by Cape Commune. Now I only played one game but the second DLC's focus trees look really dull apart from Hungary's one. I really don't get why Paradox refuses the spice the game up with lots of small events that effect the gameplay just small enough so it is easy to balance but big enough so you see it happen and feel like it is the real world instead of a map you are staring at. One example on top of my head (because I live in Turkey) is maybe the referandum in Hatay province in Turkey, no big deal in terms of gameplay but a small change that could improve the game together with many things like it. On top of all that adding focus trees to nations in Eastern Europe without adjusting the focus trees of other nation's focus trees means that Hitler might try to protect Germans in Sudetenland when you are the Austria-Hungary Empire. I mean really, you couldn't just change the flavour text or something. The game just reeks of laziness. Last thing I want to talk about is the DLC policy and pricing of Paradox. Now I understand that Paradox needs to pay a salary to bunch of people to keep adding to the game but I feel like they need to reform some things because we are just not getting the price/quality ratio right. If I went out to buy a coffee and it cost me 20 Dollars because the of the coffee shop overspending, I wouldn't go "Yeah guys, I tottaly get it and support you and no body has any right complaining about it since your coffee is soo good. Your coffee is not 20 Dollars good, Paradox. Unfourtantly for me I got the Coffee Season pass so I will keep coming back to this game every so often, enjoy it for what it is then add a couple of lines here warning people. KEEP AWAY IF YOUR MONEY IS PRECIOUS AND YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE BRILLIANCE IN OLDER HOI GAMES/OTHER PARADOX GAMES. Original:Absymal AI that does not use even the basic tactics available to it, lacks the depth of other Paradox games, both the first DLC and the second one is minor as ♥♥♥♥ compared to what we get in other Paradox games (they are kinda priced accordingly but tough luck if you bought a season pass, it only includes the first 3 DLC). Is the game enjoyable? Kinda, I will keep playing since I bought it already. Would I buy it knowing how the game was? Probably not.

Any new DLC makes playing on the internet with other players impossible, so you have to buy them to play on-line.The game is interesting,  but i feel like the price is too high for what we get (especially for the DLC's).Edit: i checked it, and it's is true, it is possible to play all DLC's in multiplayer without owning them, so i guess if you want to buy this game only for multiplayer, and never play singleplayer campaign nor host a game, it is worth it.  However, i still believe the game costs too much for what it has to offer (especially the DLC's). Personal opinion.

Ryan	Recommended	408.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yyismyname/	Hearts of Iron IV is a truly fun and entertaining game, I find myself constantly losing track of time playing this game. For example making peace I always know what I'm planning on doing but always end up spending around an hour restructuring the world to my liking. Which is one of the best parts of the game, the limit is basically your imagination. My only qualm is Paradox's DLC policy with regards to focus trees. I understand their point of view, I'm just cheap lol. Anyways, this game is very much in line with Paradox's other titles so if you enjoy them you're bound to enjoy this game.

WileyPlus	Recommended	853.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070045705/	When I started off in America I noticed an immediate problem; the Southern border with Mexico, a total mess of a country, was completely porous and there was no border security whatsoever. I began to construct the largest fortification the Americas had ever seen to rectify this. Of course, another issue was the economy. For too many years, the jobs were being sucked out of the country. They went to China, to Mexico, to Japan, to any country other than here. That needed to stop. The military, too, had been gutted by the incompetent administration in favor of failed social programs. Sad! That too, had to change. Of course, in the middle of all this I still found time for Hearts of Iron IV. It was nice, but needs more golf courses and towers. 8/10.

no homo bueno si homo	Not Recommended	227.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/plvsvltra/	First of all I would like to say that I am great fan of Paradox games. I own several games like CK2, EU IV and even HoI III. I spent so many hours with my friend playing against the AI in HOI III that I expected in HOI IV another challenging yet fun game with infinite playability, but this is what I got at this point: The Single Player Experience With HOI III being a very complex game with a very strong AI (in my opinion). I was expecting in HOI IV a simplification of some of the game mechanics in the new HOI IV but still keeping the challenging AI. What I got instead is a simplification of some mechanics like Research and War Theatre managing, which was great as it made the game more playable towards the late-game but an  insanely simplistic AI . So simplistic I can even describe the AI as plain dumb. The AI will leave huge gaps in the frontline for you to basically walk through them. Sometimes they will strategically redoply to one adjacent region with no reason and lose organisation and therefore losing in combat. It reached a point that you are able to drive to Moscow with a motorised division without entering combat.For that reason, I think the Single player experience has no type of challenge [u[ no matter the difficulty [/u].  The Multiplayer Experience Back in the day when I was plaing HOI III it was very difficult to host games as there no supported servers. With HOI IV you are finally able to host your servers and finally play online. While the games can turn to be fun sometimes, they usually end up by you  smashing your head on the keyboard  because a player can't run the game faster than speed 2 leaving you and everyone else in the game stuck for hours just to see one division move to the next region. If that doesn't happen, and you somehow reach 1939 without someone's client crashing or without de-syncs and any other performance issues. People will ragequit when they lose a couple of armored divisions. So all those hours you put in to prepare for war have gone to drain, because when the AI takes over...  Oh boy... So that leaves you with one last chance, which is setting up a game with rules that are agreed upon before the game. Usually you can find those in Paradox's forum. But then when you start playing with 'serious' people. You see them doing exploits, and here are just a brief list of what me and my friends have encountered during there 'serious games': Deleting convoy troops when they are intercepted by an enemy fleet to prevent losing manpower and equipment. Rushing technology through focuses, reaching a point that you are fighting King Tigers in 1941. USA declaring war on Venezuela in 1938 through a focus war and triggering war economy and basically making USA a huge monster that not even every country allied against the US can win.  Disbanding units before getting overun to save manpower and equipment.  Circling the capital for an indefinite amount of time leaving your whole country without supplies, thanks to the wonderful programming of ParadoxAnd the list goes on! Conclusion Because of Paradox lack of interest on patching the infinite amount of exploits nor improving the AI. It leaves you, the player, with little room to enjoy. I recommend you to sit back and wait for it to be fixed  hopefully one day... 
Dodgers [KGW]	Not Recommended	1,346.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993869243/	This game is still flawed nearly a year after release and it's so poor this is actually the first game I've been bothered to ever review.The tactical AI isn't great, but the strategic AI is awful and ruins the game.  Countries don't defend their coastlines leading to odd scenarios where minor nations like spain will successfully invade the UK in 1940.Naval "combat" is broken, with fleets never coming to grips with each other and combat between fleets taking months and neither side suffering any damage.The interface looks pretty, but is less informative than previous versions.  Even functionality like message notification options and the ledger have been stripped out.  There are some postives.  I like the new air mechanics and production lines, but these don't make up for the problems.I bought at 50% off and still feel ripped off.  This game might end up as complete and polished as previous incarnations, but it's likely you're going to have to fork out close to £200 for all the DLC's, or some modding group will have to do PI's job for them.  It's certainly no-where near as good or feature complete as something like EU4.As a long term PI and HOI fan, this incarnation's current state and PI's stance on including core features in paid DLC's is very disappointing.

The AI is still completely broken the game is a shell and unlike other titles important things like say focus trees are now DLC only.Now I hated HOI3 because I sucked and couldn't get into it but this is so oversimplified and so empty...it's near unplayable without mods and apperently new "expansions" aren't going to change that. They ♥♥♥♥ed EU4 when they released Common Sense by removing basetaxDon't get this unless it's on an extreme sale, it's not going to be worth it until it's cheap and you get the season pass
Billy Shears	Not Recommended	43.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/billyshearsly/	Even though improvements over HOI3 in terms of UI designs are highly visible and HOI4's relatively easy gamming mechanism makes this installation generally entertaining, the vast simplification of the overall system makes it look like a reductive and down-scaled version of its predecessor, despite its visual superiority. The complex mechanism in HOI3, even if it hindered many players from fully appreciating its content, serves as a distinguishing feature from other, arguably more simple, strategic games. The current state of HOI4 is well below one's erstwhile expectations of this series, as aspects including diplomacy, economics, technology and, above all, warfare require hardly any expertise for players to maneouvre. AIs at this stage are far from being competent enough either ad rivals or allies to be taken seriously. All these problems are indicative of a giant step backward from what Paradox had achived with the final version of HOI3 (Their Finest Hour). It really surprised me when I realised that many good features from HOI3 (command chains, warfare mechanism, etc.) are  almost completely ignored. It appears to me that developers are really not bothered taking advantages of their previous achievements. With regards to historical accuracy, this is when HOI4 is at its worst. Obviously HOI games allow players to deviate heavily from the historical version of WWII, but HoI3 can easily allow players to follow the orthodox path; in this game, however, anyone who has any knowledge of the events between 1939 and 1945 would wish to smash Paradox's face when Soviet divisions appear (despite them being volunteers) in Benelux in 1940 fighting ALONG WITH the Allies AGAINST the Wehrmacht. One wonders the fate of the Baltic states during the same period. This was an catastrophic failure for the game as, before reaching this stage, I had tried everything I could to ensure the accuracy of the 1939-40 Western front. Sadly this is just yet another flaw the developers do not care to fix. In any case massive updates are neccesary for HOI4 to be nearly as good as HOI3, although to get those updates players will inevitably be required to pay lots of extra money, which is what Paradox Interactive always does. The very release of the game at its current state is an egregious mistake on the part of Paradox Interactive.

Pompan	Not Recommended	184.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998658140/	I do actually like the game somewhat - I've played a lot of other Paradox titles such as HOI3.Some parts of the game are really nice. It's simple to understand and utilize. I really like the factory, construction and production system.However there's an insane amount of stupidity in this game so I can never recommend it to anyone unless a major, free, bugfix is released. It's like a flawed diamond but with an asterix at the diamond clarifying that it is a useless lump of coal.Peace conferences makes no sense. Neither does war merging.DLC released with a pricetag of an old major title but with the content of a minor patch. It should've been included in the start of the game anyways.No achievements for USA, Japan or China and the USSR only receivs one whereas South Africa receives four - really Paradox?Units of the same type switch places along a front for no apparent reason, leaving huge gaps in the defences and forcing a route.Japan can super-easily defeat the whole of China very quickly. All it takes is for their troops to stop moving along the front and push forward instead. Japanese divisions probably move along the chinese frontier 2-3 times a year without even getting in a single conflict.Germany declares war right and left (well that's kind of historical) but without placing any troops near their soon to be enemies beforehand. This has led to Denmark almost capturing Berlin...Even though I like HOI4 I can't recommend it since the negatives greatly outweigh the positives.

a cat	Not Recommended	38.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tipsiponi/	Paradox is of course infamous for putting out ludicrous amounts of DLC for every single one of their games, but I've always felt that most of their games, in particular EU4 and Stellaris, are all complete games of their own and can be enjoyed without requiring the DLCs. However, HoI4 is the first time I've played one of their games and felt that it was lacking something to make it 'complete'. As it is, the game boils down to simply drawing lines on the map and push a button to tell your generals to advance, the AI of which feel both unbearably dumb yet completely necessary if only for the sheer number of forces and fronts you have to wage war on. Perhaps people who really enjoy micromanagement can get more enjoyment out of this game, but for me it just felt kinda dull.I've heard that the multiplayer is way more interesting than single player games, and I can certainly see how that can be. While the game covers land, sea, and air, and in single players it's hard to get keep up with research on all 3 and even harder to have an industry to keep all 3 up to date. Perhaps in multiplayer, where each player is free to specialize in their own areas, it might get more interesting, but sadly I've only gotten to experience this game in single player mode for now.tl:dr, this game is decnet, but definitely not worth the full price in my personal opinion.

Emperor Constantine	Not Recommended	325.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ryang5859/	Couldn' t play this game for longer then 12 hours, having mastered HOI3, 4 was pretty easy to pick up, I loved the introduction of producing equipment, the UI is slightly better and although messy I do like the battle planning system and the introduction of the national focus system, very nice improvements.Apart from that, there is nothing in this game even remotley improved on, HOI3 Black Ice, is by far a more in depth and historically accurate game. The tech and gameplay have been dumbed down beyond description, as for air combat and the airforce system, it is soo messy and impractical, as well as ill-logical. The only improvement is introducing actual number of aircraft where as HOI3 was just aircraft wings. That is litreally the only improvement for air.Naval combat could have been something amazing, the system is fine. although the balancing and accuracy is so un accurate, let alone sandbox, its just utterly unrealestic. There is no micromanagement or immersion, and they have destroyed unit gameplay. where are the offices? why cant i assign them to individual regiments. I love HOI and I really hope they take a step back from the dumbing gameplay down process. I strongly recommend buying HOI3 instead and installing the black ice mod. It is by far superior and a hell of alot cheaper.

Wayward Son	Not Recommended	278.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/atomicforge/	It's good but it's just not quite good enough. The economics side of the game is really well-modeled; all your equipment and weapons take on a new importance in terms of industrial production, requiring some careful thinking and foresight so as to avoid mid-game issues. Striking balances between military and civilian factories according to your foreseeable needs makes for an interesting meta-game aspect. Early military build-ups may take preference for military factories for instance, but can you afford to let go of those civilian factories for much-needed resources? The player will definitely ask themselves questions like these throughout the game.Diplomacy is thankfully more fleshed out this time round, with a new option to create factions and non-agression pacts actually becoming usable in single player. A smart 'reasoning' system has been implemented, making NPCs react to the player country in certain ways. It's as entirely viable, for example, to create a faction via threatening force against your neighbours as it is to do so with a charm offensive by improving relations. Trade has been simplified in an interesting way - swapping civilian factories for a set number of resources - so no more painful micro-managing of trade deals to get 100k of all resources.Combat is also pretty well done, with battles taking a little longer now compared to HoI3 and a raised emphasis on success at the operational level, which can be accomplished a number of ways thanks to doctrinal foci. Commanders intending to build a strong infantry-based army heavily supported by artillery may wish to adopt superior firepower doctrines, while others focusing on a more mobile, tank-led military would prefer doctrinal training for mobile operations. The use of tactics form a major, realistic part of battles now, with better-skilled commanders more likely to use better tactics in order to win battles.At this stage you might be thinking why am I not giving this a thumbs up? Well, there are a few reasons.AI issues is a big one. The AI is rather weak in terms of its intelligence. It remains tied by feet and hands to the battleplan system, which is a really ineffective way for it to fight on many occasions, as it will perform rapid strategic re-deployments to areas which are not necessarily the most urgent. Take Italy for instance. Poor, poor Italy, whose navy gets crushed almost every time in the Mediterranean, whose soldiers consistently fail to defend the most important Italian VP locations, allowing the British to stroll right into Rome in 1940. This happens a lot, and brings me to my next point: naval invasions.Naval invasions are implemented terribly. You need a minimum of 50% air and/or naval superiority in the seas along which you intend to send your invasion fleet. This is too easy, requiring a few destroyer squadrons or fighter wings at best, both of which the AI has a tendency to spam. If you can reach that minimum, you can invade anybody with the bare minimum of effort. The solution to fix it of course is simple: require air and/or naval supremacy, meaning 100% control over those seas.Historically, when the Western Allies invaded Normandy in 1944, the Luftwaffe could muster only approximately 170 fighters to duel with more than 12,000 of their Allied counterparts, and the Kriegsmarine remained locked up in north German ports, sending only a few S-Booten to harrass the invasion fleet. This situation is the very definition of supremacy and there's absoutely no reason why this shouldn't apply in-game.World tension is something of a very irritating, sandbox-y annoyance. It's a measure of how tense international politics are and various kinds of action will increase or decrease it. Declarations of war, annexations and post-war treaties in the realm of non-Democratic nations tend to increase it, while natural decay, guarantees of independence and declarations of war from Democratic nations tend to decrease it.The developers seem to have this idea in their heads of providing an additional challenge for the Authoritarian and Democratic players, in that keeping WT low is ideal for the former, while raising it is ideal for the latter. This is obviously very silly, since WT as an element in itself is not bound to ideology; Democratic actions should ordinarily have just as much impact on WT as non-Democratic ones. It's also heavily advantageous for Democratic nations. By providing them with the guarantee option at 25% WT, they are able to throw out ahistorical guarantees willy-nilly to anyone who is being justified against by a non-Democratic nation. The problem is 25% WT gets reach very quickly, within the first two in-game years, providing little to no room for non-Democratic nations to do ahistorical things, quite in spite of the fact that the guarantee options are ahistorical themselves; in reality of course nobody but Poland got anything like a guarantee of independence prior to 1940. And yet, try justifying against Portugal as Nationalist Spain in 1937 and the Anglo-French will have none of it.Again, the solutions are very simple: massively increase PP cost for ahistorical guarantees; decrease WT effects for non-Democratic actions; or remove ahistorical guarantees entirely.My final reason for the thumbs down is a simple, oft re-hashed yet critically important one: the continuation of PDX's DLC release business model. I just can't abide by this. I understand perfectly well that game companies need to remain competitive in the current environment but what we are going to end up paying is about $120/£90/E100 for the finished product. This is unacceptable, especially when the DLCs don't really improve the gameplay experience in a significant way. Unique focus trees? Improve puppet dynamics? This is mod-creatable stuff which should absolutely be in the base game anyway! Worse yet, there's a dirty little piece of reasoning behind all this: PDX are intent on continuing to release DLC and patches for previous, long-ago released games in their line-up. They won't be named because you know exactly what I'm talking about. But it's a very poor business practice and shows a lack of commitment to current and future games.TL;DR: Don't buy this for the time being. Go have a look at other titles, put money and effort into them and wait until a 'Panzer-Pusher Final Edition' has been released, then grab it on sale. This review is updated as of Feb 1st '17.
Berrii	Not Recommended	156.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redcoree/	  TL;DR   Pros:   Lots of replayability, countries feel different from each other. You can play historically or play with crazy things happening like the US becoming communist. Very big science/tech trees with tens of planes, tanks, ships, special infantry etc for every country.  Co-op and multiplayer is very fun and makes the game twice as fun in my opinion, since players are mostly smarter than the AI and are more interesting to play with/against. Strategic things are taken into account in combat; logistics, aerial superiority, terrain and the likes. Cons:   Game gets VERY laggy in mid-late game when countries have huge armies moving everywhere Only real way to play is conquer everyone  Different countries' vehicles and tanks etc. have few if any differences.  Techs trees and the like are similar with most countries (Form alliance with these countries, or get reasons to wage war against them, every country has closely the same Infantry/Air/Navy tech) AI isn't very intelligent Peace negotiating is very poor DLCs contain things that should be in the base game (though you can download mods to get these features for free)Hearts of Iron IV a great strategy game. You can play as any country basically in the WW2 era and the differences between countries is tremendous. Every country has a unique tech tree (although most have the same type of setup). It's interesting how there's 3 main factions battling each other most of the time (Allies, Axis, Comintern) and you can choose to be any one of the 3 political stances, Democratic, Fascist, Communist or then neutral if you want to avoid getting attacked by huge alliances. Co-Op/multiplayer I found to be super fun and I'd say the game is way better if you have someone else to play with (at least for a few playthroughs), you can forge very powerful alliances or get a big friend group to play against each other.The game basically revolves around war though and it's not really possible to play peacefully or defensively, it's just not fun whatsoever. The combat system might be underwhelming for some since it's just a bubble showing whether your troops are winning or the enemy. Your combat effectiveness is decided by logistics, terrain, support from air forces and of course how advanced your troops and weaponry are. You can play the game from 1936 where the game will not follow history mostly and there can be some very interesting alliances and events, or you can start from 1939 if you want a more historically accurate game.  If you play with Germany vs playing with a small South-American country you're going to have vast differences in gameplay, so you can choose how you want to play the game. Some want to start with huge amounts of factories and manpower and be able to take over countries instantly and some want to fight against all odds with a less influential country.You have to take into account land, air and often sea to gain an upper hand on your opponents. You need to have fighters/anti-air to counter your opponent's airforce, bombers to help your infantry gain an upper hand, infantry obviously to capture areas and cause the heavy casualties, and ships to block off the enemy's supply convoys, foreign aid, destroy carriers and whatnot.In the late game though the game becomes almost unplayable. The lag becomes so bad that it doesn't matter whether you're playing on the fastest time setting or the slowest because they both go at the same speed. Peace is in my opinion done very poorly. You'd think that the 2 major things in the game are war and peace but even starting a peace negotiation is impossible 90% of the time. The AI is definitely not as smart as you'd hope in a game all about strategy and how intelligently you play your country. Most of the tech tree is the same with all countries but even the ones that have differences like the models of your tanks, the vehicles still have largely the same stats as other countries (eg. Russian tanks having the same stats as US ones). Overall if you can get the game on a discount I think it's worth it but the game has a lot of things it could improve on. (Hopefully things that are going to get improved later on and not with 20€+ DLCs.)Rating: 7/10
koskiari	Recommended	991.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034907165/	The Hearts of Iron- series has long been the great-granddad of grand strategy games for me. The 4th installment as a whole is my favourite of them all, and I keep coming back to from time to time. Sometimes trying different nations and sometimes previously played ones, but with different political approach. It even has the appeal for me to play the same nation same way multiple times, trying to learn from previous mistakes and optimitizing my performance.There's so much depth to the game it would take a small book to thoroughly review it, but I'll just settle to saying it has everything what comes to leading a nation through the times of WW2 in it modeled one way or another. The only aspect that remains pretty much abstracted is tactical battles, as your control is limited on division/flotilla/air fleet level, and the only way to affect below that is how you assemble your divisions (what kind of battallions and support companies are included in each division structure) and a little bit by choosing the general in command of the division. You can choose to abstract it even further by letting your generals take care of your large scale orders on army level, but I personally prefer to control divisions myself to preserve valuable manpower.Other than that, you certainly have a number of ways of tailor your nations actions, and it isn't necessarily easy to approach. But like so many times in case of games with great depth, once you master the game mechanics there is a vast amount of things to keep your interest up. If Paradox games and grand strategy games in general are to your liking, in my opinion Hearts of Iron 4 is one of if not your best bet to play this very frequently depicted era.
ePIC_DK	Not Recommended	180.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198045716182/	Great game at first look, but with more gameplay you find that the game is shallow and limited. Plus the AI is useless.
Fakka ॐ	Not Recommended	235.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FakkaTheGiant/	Pro first, since this is a downvote:- Nice Graphics, amazing Music- Easy to get into, fun with friends- It feels good to watch the battle, and it feels even better to fight a very close war lasting over 2 years (especially if you win)- You can play literally every nation in the game- I like that you can customize exactly how your army is built upContra:- Gets stale VERY fast, after ~30 hours without mods, ~90 hours with mods (took over the world with spain by now so im calling quits)- After a while all the countries play out almost the same, most countries DO HAVE THE SAME IDEAS- Certain things are very broken, as usual - DLC's are a joke both in content and price, I heavily recommend getting mods instead if you do happen to buy the game- Planning system sometimes does really weird things, some controls are weirdly mapped too- Horrible Performance for me after 1940~- No coring mechanic, no conscription mechanic, if you are out of manpower, you lose- Wars, Allies and Peace Treaties can be a huge pain- AI is just terribad, tries naval invasions with either 2 or 18 troops, sometimes in incredibly terrible spots (who invades the nothern tip of norway instead of france? thats right, this AI), doesnt react correctly to declerations of war sometimes, declares war in unbeliveably bad situations or way too late after it already had a reason for war, doesnt build their units right, yada yada- Diplomatic system is unfullfilling at best, political system is not really existentAll in all: Even if you are a fan of paradox (or especially if you are a fan of paradox) dont get this game outside of sales, its  simply not worth that much, and please dont buy the DLC. The way you enjoy this game is with a bunch of friends, all having the same mods, in multiplayer, on amazing pc's so the endgame isnt meaningless. If you wanted to buy this for singleplayer, I can hardly recommend it.And if you still happen to question why in the world this is a downvote even if I spend 92 hours and said 30 without mods were fun, well... the least a dev can do for the consumer is make a game fun on its own, but since this is a GSG, I would expect it to be fun still well 100-200 hours into playing the game. That just doesn't happen. Fun falls and breaks its neck sometime after you pulled off 2 different countries and then you can't go back without Mods or Multiplayer, or at the point where you realize most countries have exactly the same ideas. Thats not acceptable. Especially not for 40€, especially not for that kind of DLC you wanna sell.

Joachim Murat	Not Recommended	732.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDandyKing/	 Room for Improvement Hearts of Iron IV should be a typical release for Paradox - a decent game but with obvious bugs and a persistent haunting feeling that the game is lacking content - but this time around, the latter is certainly in full force. Hearts of Iron IV continues the series' theme, but makes some questionable design decisions. Now, while I myself didn't play Hearts of Iron III, II, or I, I still expected a tad bit more out of this game. Paradox released it right before the summer began, and I've had nearly three months to play it.I was very surprised to see the amount of depth - or lack thereof - this time around. While I haven't played HoI3, I did see some gameplay and it did seem to be a game with a very good sense of depth in mechanics, even if arguably leaning too heavily on the micromanagement side of things. In HoI4, though, some of these mechanics are far too oversimplified and abstracted. A prime issue is that of resources. In the game, production revolves around you assigning factories to build tank models, warships, infantry equipment, et cetera. Each item has its own cost in resources such as oil, rubber, chromium, and the like. If you don't supply enough of a resource by either conquering provinces it's harvested from or importing it, then production that relies on the resource will slow down. This system is fine, but it's the only system that involves resources. So, once you build, say, a fighter plane, that plane no longer takes up resources in order to operate. This means that you could have absolutely no oil being extracted or imported, and still operate your airwings and tank divisions perfectly fine. Sure, they initially require oil to first build, but not to operate. This completely throws things off-wack.The Japanese war effort itself was largely driven by a need for more fuel resources. The German war effort was also impacted by resource shortages. But, in game, there's practically no active impetus driving you to secure more resources like there was in real life. Your tanks will still drive, your planes will still fly, and your ships will still sail. This makes certain decisions ingame near pointless, such as the Japanese deciding the first-strike the Americans because they were in desperate need of fuel and needed a disabling strike to secure those resources.There's also the fact that this game suffers from a very impairing amount of situational un-awareness. In a game like this, if the enemy makes a move and you are unaware of it and thus do not counter it, you will suffer serious, if not fatal, drawbacks. Thus, it is important for the game to keep you aware of key movements by the enemy that could take vast territory without you noticing. But, there's no such system in place. This is particularly compounded because of the fact that you'll usually be overseeing multiple theaters of war, and thus need to spread your attention across all of them. But if, say, a small enemy force manages to exploit a small weakness in your lines, breaks through, and drives towards your capital, the game won't even give you the slightest notice. You could be managing your industry, divisions, political cabinet, diplomatic relations, anything, and when that critical action occurs, you won't be notified. This is in direct conflict with what Paradox themselves have said they wish for the game, as they want it to be less pause-heavy and more smooth. But, if you aren't given any notifiers to counterbalance the such, then you'll just be pausing even more in order to make up for it.Speaking of management, the airgame is a mess. The system relies on airwings, which are basically groupings of planes that can take missions over strategic air areas, like Northern France, the Adriatic Sea, et cetera. Once you assign an airwing, you must manage which airfield it lands at, what missions it will run, along with whether it will do day/night missions, and finally its repair threshold. The problem is that, apparently, smaller airwings incur less penalties, as well as allow for more targets to be acquired when bombing ground targets. According to this, the optimal airwing size is 100 planes, so ideally you'd be managing dozens of 100-strong airwings across entire theaters. It's silly and would benefit from more automation instead of micromanagement.The AI doesn't fare well with the mechanics either. I know I should set my bar low, but I'd like to have at least some expectations. Instead, we get brilliant manuever after brilliant manuever from the AI, like Mussolini sending half his army on a nice Pan-Atlantic cruise where they all get sunk by the Royal Navy and die, or where the French High Command decides to send all their forces to defend Tunisia and Algiers while the Germans literally walk through the Maginot Line (this nearly ruined a MP game I was playing because France fell way too early), or where Italy offers to give me their entire army as an expeditionary force (because we all know they don't need those guys for anything). The general incompetence of the AI often just leads to the game stalemating unless the player moves into the theater. The Spanish Civil War is a great example of this, where often the Fascists and Communists get stuck swapping cities for years until either Italy sends tons of volunteers or the player does. There's also the ridiculous coups mechanic. If you have spare political power, which you often will have during 1941 and beyond, then you can very easily support a political party in another country and take them from 2% to 40%, then either launch a coup and watch as half the country rebels, or just wait a few more months and see the entire country turn fascist. It's so silly and game-breaking that it has to be the most egregious mechanic in the entire game. Aside from the political power cost (you'll be swimming in political power anyways) there are absolutely zero repercussions. Just turn on your magical mind control ray and the Germans will all be singing Katyusha within a few years. It's practically cheating, to the point where in MP games people often disallow it because it throws everything out the window.Edit: Another very real problem with the game is the massive slowdown issues. Around 1940-1941 (when usually all the major nations have joined the war) the game experiences drastic problems. It gets to the point where the game can't be smoothly played past speed 1 or 2. I've had sessions where I've played for a little less than an hour and have only gotten through a month.There's just so many problems that collectively add up in the game, it really makes me sad. The map is a mess, oftentimes becoming completely unreadable unless you zoom out very far. Politics are near nonexistent, world tension is a meter that becomes very useless early on - it's just there to prevent the Democratic nations from steamrolling Germany into oblivion in 1937 - and ideologies are changed like a pair of socks. There's just so much abstraction to it all that really it seems more just like a Paradox game set in the 1930s and 1940s than a WWII game. Wait at least a few months or until the first expansion to pick this game up. Right now, it's just not worth it. I'd give it a 6/10.

Case	Not Recommended	386.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198002721952/	Hearts of Iron IV is a game that deserves a little extra attention. Let me explain.After playing about a dozen campaigns as minor nations and major nations, usually Turkey (minor) and France (major) the finer details of exactly how strange this game is come to light. That is, it is very silly.While your mileage may vary, the AI is in serious need of some kind of rework. For example, some of the major features of this game, the front-line and battle plan systems, lack any sort of internal logic. I can hear the dialouge in my head every time I right click to set the lines up;ME: Set up a front line from Calais to Nice, please.GENERAL: Didja hear that men?! Set up FIVE front lines and ONLY MAN THE LINE IN BELGIUM.ME: No! Don't do that! Man the entire line.GENERAL: MEN! Split the army into five parts and stick that tank division DIRECTLY ON THE BORDER. Because F*** that guy in particular. (tanks have low HP and defensive qualities)ME:GENERAL: And don't mind that one province minor (Luxembourg), you don't need to fortify that.ME: *Is blitzkreig'd in a week through Luxembourg*While this may seem like nit-picking, it really isn't. This is a feature used more frequently than any other in the game if you don't like micro-managing literally hundreds of divisions for hours. And, sure, you COULD set up dozens of armies (my preferred method) and dozens of plans (that sweet combat bonus) and dozens of lines, orders and other things to fill your UI. You could, and WILL do this, or you will end up surrounded because you didnt fortify one province. This would all be well and good. But this isn't even scratching the surface of the game. In fact, this is one small set of gripes on one part of the game. We haven't gotten into air combat where notifications are sparse and unhelpful, naval invasions that are either a joke or a slaughterhouse (but rarely succeed), and all of the tiresome, rediculous decisions the AI makes. For example, the Soviets changing their mind about an invasion of Germany (at war, mind you) and moving their entire army to starve in Africa instead. Or being forced to invade Japan navally because my allies won't let me use their air bases for paratroopers (I waited TWO YEARS). Or occupying territory for that very ally instead of for myself because his one unit was there first.I could go on for...well, about a hundred and thirty hours. But I won't. Suffice to say, this game is silly. Tl;Dr Wait a year for patches and DLC. And if the reviews are negitive, buy something else. 
Reaux Of The Fire Caste	Not Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/embingl/	If you're a fan of complex strategy games and WW2. This game is a really good choice for you to pick it up. But the game is empty, it feels like missing something which is of course DLCs!. I hate Paradox's DLC policy thats for sure but I can understand them but this game (unlike the other game they released nearly the same time-Stellaris-)is just bland. Its DLC's are bad. And it has the look of the EA games that everything that matters or fun will be released as DLC which is from the look of it seems true. So if you're gonna buy this game just wait for a big sale and use lots of mods...
\Forever Alone/	Not Recommended	430.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008355995/	Game is great in some aspects while extremely bad other. This review dosent take accounts devs own handpain DLC policy so if your waiting whining about that. Vote with your wallets.Good.- More realistic production with more changeable stats for unis. You can invest lot of ponts for single tank to better other areas than other players while personally i typically invest in Realibility. So my eguiment dont cause casulties and dmg to manpower and eguiment as mush when normally.You can make own factions like Nordic kingdoms united for sample. Emporors united in asia etc.Well good points what i can say currently ended there. Now we shall go bad parts of this game. There is lot of them and i have little bit comparison with last game HOI3 and i have to say with my current pc its unplayable because its crashes to mush. But it did lot more good than this game.- Ai is idiotic in everything. From diplomacy to fighting you will not find it challenging outside of how frustorative they are. - Democratic nations are braindead protect the weak maniacs what is annoing. Last game i know you could basicly go counquer entire world and no one cared. Here it is to extreme for sample i do coub on sweden as finland and make it communistic. Then they either join Axis or allies and they accepts their invations simply to say handpain you. When its idiotic to join that war as allies perspective. Like there are many games where im part of faction i cause far some random factions of no where. Like Yemen or arabic countries and Allies will protect them when in real WW2 only♥♥♥♥♥♥what allies did against soviet union was your bad boy stalin go out of class when invading part of poland, baltic countrys and finland. This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as handpain. When you complain about this people recommend mods or simply do tricky call war of many countries so over protective nations will lose all Political power protecting them. Otherwords its useless system to annoy players... No sense at all.- Wars never end outside of total counquest of enemy. Once your war plus typical social justice Allies and democratic or possible simial trait policy joingin before losing will cause typically entire world invade you. Like if i start finland vs sweden war you will see America attacking you and british with france 99% time. "in real life they were cowards outside of churchill saying lets nuke stalin." Other problem what may happen if your sneaky and you change their ideology and then you make multible coub nations like communist sweds and nationalist sweds against neutral dem swedes. all of them join part of nazis, soviets, and dems they start huge war on swedens soil. LoL- Winning war and sharing spoils of war is bad. No sense in it. People can claim some arbitery place somewhere in world even thought they dont any claim for it. If your for sample japan and your war collide together some fancy reason. Nazis can claim asian side of map while you can take something from their side? Wait what? what does this have. i have seen games where nazis and allies share soviet union and nazis simply took firstly moscow for win condition and allies made lot of vassals. Like there was time when i managed counquer part of soviet union as finland and i had controll of stalingrad nazis just used points to take it away from me. lovely... Also its impossible to make peace because there arbinery % for activing this goal and you need to be at war 6 months untill peace can be made.............. Really its not like there hasnt been wars what took 1h and that caused peace. Also invaders cannot call peace it needs to be defnsive player who calls it. Even more if your part of faction and if you call them into war. Faction leader call shots when peace is made. Really mate really...- UI is bad and your game system is awful. in HOI3 you could add make invasion targets to you army commands and AI would adjust possible needs, automatic defence and holding of area from all categorys of naval, air and land troops. But in this game you need to controll all manually.... Why devs why!!!! Go play as japan when there´s millions fleets and troops with commands minimal troop amounts under commander etc. While trying to plan invasions with extemely awful attack plan system. If there was mod make HOI3 system to HOI4 i would instantly download it. Its frusrating manuall order multible fleets and air forces move other region, add attack plan. When war happens you need to keep eye on ocean of Usa that they dont cap those pesky islands and refit more troops to their defence. Also upgrading is impossible in ships this game. so if you have tier 1 ship you cannot up gun it like hoi3. Handpain heck that desing your attack plan is awful. If your planning war and you know enemy will get neigbor as ally. You cannot combine fronts as same front. Like china and northenr independent part of china. IF you active bridge accident you will invade both. But order to add that military plan you need to make 2 different commanders and armys with different objectives. When i played my friend online and he tried to invade me with sweden. This happen. I managed make norway as vassal with my nationalist finland. But hes attack plan included invasion of vassal norway because of this. hes plan didnt work when he invaded. He had no idea that did he join in war or not. While it was impossible to him invade it and all troops were like what are we doing. While my troops managed beat their troops and motti them easy. This game is super awful.- Making divisions is awful. You need XP to add tanks to infantry divisions what is extremely expensive if you dont have any xp commanders in Politic area and your not holding 24/7 training what drains resourses. Old game you could make intependent tank division and attach it to infantry or something else. Here your just need to use xp order to add your eguiment in use. While you have multible different military groubs. So maintaining all of them is awful experience even more if your small nation. The idea of this system was awesome but same time it was poorly executed. Like remove xp cost changing division style. Because main negative for making super huge divions is they are extremely costly and have harder time to attack effevtive way more narrow areas. For sample if i made 30k size army invade norway thru mountains. Norway can make super defensive line by smaller amount of men with decent eguiment. Like my heavy tanks couldt even help me get thru one small area of 6k of troops with larger and supperior troops. Also roads also limits your army size when attacking some area.-Tecn tree is to limited and personally bad. They limited to mush stuff and removed some basic stuff compared to HOI3. For sample its impossible to invest armored vehicle dotrice because making decent armored transports is extremely expensive. Like if i wanted to make cheap armor protected infantry dotrice its limited while last game you oculd invest lot of stuff. Also steal stuff from enemy nation like if enemy nation had max lvl tank armor you spy could steal it for you even thought your desing lvl is 1lvl. Also if there werent for XP what can buff some eguiment all tanks would be same. From tank to tank same stats. When HOI3 allows you invest mobile medium tanks or super protective ones for infantry support.- Espionage is dead there is nothing about it. Your spy is pretty mush tech stuff eletronic tree what allows see stuff from enemy side. But this can be more cheaper matter dealed by having scouts in army. What sees enemy troop type etc. So useless tech majorty of time. Even more if your playing typical historial AI. When HOI3 you could steal super good stuff here its impossbile.In the end game has so mush problems in general to mush manual micro to controll army. bad UI and simply bad desing choices. While i said i dont add DLC policy here but im saying only this. If your selling players improvements in this game behind useless junk. No...

The colors or terrain of the world map is jarring to the eyes but at least you can turn off the epileptic night-and-day cycle. Air and naval combat has been dumbed down to abstract regions where they offer almost no effectivness, not to mention submarines are useless now. One of the few good things about this game is the existance of a non-abstract economic system where you can see how much of certin equitment is producted. The Fouse Trees are also a nice touch of giving opitions to nations compared to the railroading of HOI3 through events. Overall, if a products is the sum of all it's parts, this game doesn't have enough good parts

The Fouse Trees are also a nice touch of giving opitions to nations compared to the railroading of HOI3 through events. Overall, if a products is the sum of all it's parts, this game doesn't have enough good parts

Emperor Rocket	Not Recommended	90.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999579952/	Let me introduce you with the most important sentence of this review:It's a great game. It's complex, got a lot of depth, and even though some mechanics are a bit weird, like needing a reason for declaring a war (chuckles sovietly), overall it's maybe THE perfect strategy game. All the factors and actions and events that have an impact on each other is amazing, and you have to carefully choose in which direction you wanna go right from the start. That said, there are a few cons however, like the inflexibility and the unneccessarily complex attack plans. Planning them is awful, taking time for the troops to get in position can take eternities, especially in the quite slow late game. Literally.And this is why I do not recommend it yet. This is the only thing that really needs to be fixed by Paradox. It's late game has terrible performance. And this is an issue I found in forums from 2016. And Paradox seems to have done nothing about it. And this is really frustrating. My soviet save needs 15 minutes to load. FIFTEEN. Saving takes 2-3, a day goes by in approx 3 minutes. And for all of you who play it, you know how little a day means in this game. Small comparison: With a fresh start in '36, a day goes by in ~20 seconds. Saving takes 10 seconds, loading a couple of minutes too, but not that much. But late game is absolutely unplayable. And this is very sad, because this way you'll never get to finish this amazing game. I feel bad for not recommending this, but I think Paradox needs a kick in the♥♥♥♥♥to fix the issue. There are even ideas out there demonstrated by other games and the HOI community, like capping the number of divisions, e.g. by making them cost upkeep so you don't spam your enemy to death. Hell, in the very first strategy games I ever played in my life this was implemented in one way or another. And you're telling me you can't handle the situation, Paradox? After 2 years? Well, I hope they do something about it. Hopefully quick. I swear, as soon as the problem is adressed I'll rewrite this review to show my great love for this great game.

Chimera	Not Recommended	25.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/allen980123/	Very disappointed. This game is an apporach to Civllization V. It's even more arcade than the arcade mode in HOI3. Core systems are oversimplified and you loss choices on both tactic and strategic levels.Poor AI. Chiang kai-shek picked 'rocket' and 'secret weapon' as national focus and theres absolutely no point of doing that.

I can't even control a fleet to 'join' a battle between one of my fleet and the enemy's. There's also a hilarious modifier on the carrier which you get a LINEAR reduction of 20% on number of CAGs dispatched per carrier if your fleet has more than 4 carriers. This means that if you have 10 carriers in your fleet, there will be 0 operational CAGs.No esponiage,  no resource management, no technology on weapons, armors, engines etc, no need to care about the supply. Those were key determinants in a war. The game depth is greatly reduced, and this harms the overall game experience.It's still fun, but not as much as the previous titles, and the graphics and musics are beautiful.

((((Semyon The Great))))	Recommended	224.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SemyonTheGreat/	HOI4 is probably best release of paradox so far, here's some mixed things however:+- nicer but somewhat weird IMO graphics+ perfomance is much like eu4 except less calculations which means faster progression of actual game- all the options of changing graphical rendering are completely pointless as they don't give a single fps more(they don't actually change rendering? they just hide it from you?)+ + + game is actually alive compared to mindless HOI3+ + + modding+ + + 'generic' focus trees let you shape nations and seem competitive with unique ones- - pretty much all non major countries lack their own focus trees and other special thingies- - lack of many potential substates, which means nicely breaking up germany/USSR and lots of other things are impossible- - game is 'dumbed down' compared to HOI3, that is mostly about serious offensive bonuses like planning(and maybe air superiority?), some things are *mandatory*(like planes) and not very nicely forced into state/zone system, which are actually simply clumsier than having stuff anywhere and ordering anything as you want in HOI3+ + overall however game makes more sense and is more realistic, it is good for potential later cold war too+ simplified gameplay generally cuts micromanagement and makes things easier, which is great for multiplayer - - still some bugs on release, my all out wars over all western USSR borders and whole africa might be the reason why game just crashes exactly on 8:00 of 27 april 1943- too little tech and other stuff? they mostly end in 1944, also slot research system is quite restrictictive at all times- there's too much damn planes!- japanese weebs got forced into my solo german axis faction when USSR forced war on them through focus

belkeirun	Not Recommended	54.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007296109/	As a huge fan of HOI3 this is a huge step in the wrong direction.  It can no longer be called a 'grand strategy game'.  It has been simplified way too much.  Most people play a grand strategy game for the immersion and attention to details, take that all away and give control of the forces to the AI and you might as well be playing an arcade game.  Now I'm not saying it not a bad game, people who want a simpler war strategy game will probably enjoy it, but it isn't as advertised a 'grand strategy game'.Other issues are the AI, it's soo bad it's comical.  Playing as the UK I witnessed the entire italian submarine fleet suicide itself up in the north sea?  I saw the italian army in north africa, retreat from a favorable position back to a naval base and then lauch themselves into transports for a naval attack on alexandria through the british fleet.  The definition of insanity is trying the same thing repeatedly and expecting different results, well the japanese are beyond insane, they spent their entire navy trying to land a single japanese infantry unit near singapore whilst my 60 strong naval planes took out the pride of the japanese navy, one ship at a time, after 6 months they had no navy and I still hadn't bother to send any naval forces to the far east.Another issue the UI, it's beyond infuriating.  Pause on event, hmmm only if your lucky.  Manual pause yeah we'll override that once you look at the screen in the wrong way.  Organising forces, hah!  Sorting fleets is soo painful its not funny.  And does anyone else have a wierd double click effect when adding ships to a new fleet?  Adding an AA gun to a garrison unit? hmmm nope sorry no XP to do that, wtf?Is it fixable yes, but will require lots of patches and even more mods to make it what it should be.

Same goes with air units and air zones, much too limited control in my opinion.Graphics are pretty 3D (but I prefer the visibility offered by NATO counters really...)New resource system (with Political points needed to fill your cabinets or update your policies/Army-Navy-Air experience points needed to upgrade/improve/create divisions...) doesn't quite offer the flexibility I was hoping for.The manufacturing of equipment - that can be improved - which then go to a pool and are used to upgrade/create units is a good idea, but, in my opinion, it really lacks the variety we had in HOI 3 and doesn't quite clear the rest of the issues I'm facing with a game so dumped down vs its legacy...I bought the whole collector pack, and I'm happy to support Paradox with my money, but I'll get back to HOI 3 and forget about this 4th installment until someone in the workshop manages to "vanilla" it back to something closer to HOI 3 ;)

Feldmarschall Schumi Paşa	Not Recommended	177.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062476339/	Why do we have to pay for everything? The game without DLCs does not have enough detail. Older game "HOI 3" includes so many details which this game does not include. For example: production license. You can use that option in the older game (HOI3) without any DLCs. But if you wanna use it in this game, oh stop. PAY FIRST. WHY? Why should I? HOI IV is good grand strategy game to play, but Paradox still have to add so many things to game, WITHOUT DLCs. If they will add very original things to game, I will happily pay for these stuff. But not for production license or new focus trees. Please do not cross the line about selling DLCs Paradox. You might have lose so many players because of this policy. For now, i wont recommend to buy this game. But my thought may change according to Paradox's DLC policy...
TheSnowHindu	Not Recommended	113.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSnowHindu/	The naval aspects of the game are still very buggy, namely fleets getting engaged in fighting and not being able to withdraw and yet the fighting does not continue. So you have your "grand fleet" capable of crushing anything stuck fighting 4 destroyers somewhere and unable to get it back. The land and air aspects of the game are very good and enjoyable but as soon as you have to go anywhere near the sea the whole game becomes a pharse with the controls being infuriating. All you want is to move some troops accross some water to an undefended province but no you can't because of "lack of intel," man doesn't care if every single nazi on my ships drowns ill just send some more but actually leave the♥♥♥♥♥♥♥port.Conclusion of rant- overall a decent game but a small handful of bugs just make the game such a chore to play and frankly so many months after release is a bit pathetic.

0zymandiasss	Not Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058858803/	Put bluntly, they have simplified this game far too much to the point where it's not really worth playing. This game's predecessor. HoI3, was too complex for most people. The management was a pain and many systems were difficult to understand. In response to that, Paradox have stripped anything that could be called "complex" from HoI4 that has quite frankly made this an arcade game with a WWII skin.The most obvious problem is the AI. It attacks rarely and is often completely oblivious to pending encirclements. Ity will often start battle it has no hope of winning, only degrading it's own forces rather than falling back to a better defensive position. the Japan AI seem obsessed with starting as many wars as it can as soon as it can without evaluating if it can win. I expect this to be patch, but it will take a while.Then there is the supply system or rather the lack of one. Supply in this game seems meaningless. Take north africa, it's a hostile climate that was a slog for both sides to fight in, attrition was high on men and machines. In HoI4, it may as well be a stroll along the beach, it presents no challenge at all to the player and can be safely ignored.Finally we have possibly the worst part of the whole thing, the combat. Heart of Iron games are about combat, it's what the game should be built around. Combat is a joke. What happens is you group your unit together in armies, draw a line for them to start at, and draw another line to finish at and hit play. Comat in HoI4 is point and click, nothing more. What makes this worse is the planning bonus. Your troops get upto a 50% attack bonus depending on how long you wait before "attacking". When I say attacking, I mean letting the AI send soldiers along the path you drew, not actually you controlling them. The game actually rewards the player for not interacting with the game.The game does have some upsides. The production system is a massive improvement as is naval and air combat, although the air zones need to be made much smaller rather than covering half of France.Overall, if you're new to strategy games, you might enjoy this. If you have played other strategy games where to actually have to manage anything, then you'll get border of this after about 20 hours or less. As I say, it's an arcade game in a WWII skin, there's no real challenge here, just point and click win.
Zhyrul	Not Recommended	30.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005060208/	This is a very preliminary review as I played only 4 hours so far. It was hard to decide if this game should be recommended or not. There are some very good elements and it is a good game overall, but as a HoI 1, 2, 3 player for many years I am disappointed. The game feels very "basic" and unfinished, definitely moved aways from grand strategy. In particular, there are some elements that I find problematic:- Command Tree: the command echelons are removed, which makes the management of theaters much more complicated, with the AI running around. The previous system to assign orders worked much better. Here there are some simplifications that make the overall system over complicated instead. Airplanes, Navy, Army are not coordinated anymore as it was before and give orders to a vast army hard too.Please, fix the command structure as soon as possible, that is, in my opinion, the most annoying issue.- Technologies: very simplified, I would like to have more choice, as it was in HoI3. I understand the goal of providing an easier system for new comers to HoI, but it looks almost too simple and historically inaccurate. Technological advances were far more important. Moreover, some technologies are exclusive, but I do not see the reason for it.- Trade: we are in the 30s and 40s, barter is long gone :) How it comes that money are removed in exchange for civilian industries? Also, there could be automation, especially when prices do not change... As Germany, why would I exchange the same amount of civilian industry with Italy (an ally) and Sweden? One more issue... If I do not have resources I can still build (even if more slowly), how does that work?- Diplomacy: here I found some problems, as Germany I could conquer Poland after Danzig or War, but without chosing "War with France". However, Poland had already the independency guaranteed and the AI did not declare war. In the meanwhile, Italy conquered Turkey in 1940 (?), I have no idea how that happened.I hope that Paradox will patch the game and listen to its traditional userbase. Paradox's strategy probably includes many dlc, hopefully not too expensive, which I am fine with as long as they are not substituting elements that should be in the vanilla game.I love the company, I even bought the newly emitted stocks of Paradox when the company landed on the stock market last month and I really want to recommend this game, but not to "hardcore strategists", at the current stage.

TeaMaster.Gyokuro	Not Recommended	166.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MichaelParadox/	Is this a fun game? Sure, it is. As the Commander-in-Chief, you can build a formidable army crashing your enemy's plot, seizing their lands and embracing the glory of victory. During the gameplay the most adorable thing must be the green bubbles(which indicates your divisions are in prevail) ,the continuous advance and changing colors of the map. If you choose the country "wisely", like Germany, Russia and Italy this game can easily incite your pride, sense of success and hormone in your brain. However, this is it. Compared to other games of Paradox like EU4, stellaris or CK2 the content of this game is very limited. ONLY warfare. However, it will be too judgmental to downplay this game because of this limitation since this game is designed only for the warfare. Unfortunately, this game's AI is ridiculously funny no matter tactically or strategically. In tactics, you can easily besiege dozens of AI's infantry divisions by some simple management of your tank divisions. As for strategy, I have seen many times that United States did not declare war on Germany even in 1950s. The terrible AI made the game less interesting.And let's talk about the DLCs. Now we have only two DLCs(one's status is "coming soon" up to now) It's hard to believe this game was published 06/06/2016 with only two DLCs. And the first DLC which names "Together for Victory" is an awfully terrible one. The "interesting countries" in this DLC are South Africa, NEw Zealand, Australia, Poland, India, Canada. What the HELL! I think one with the basic knowledge about WW2 could tell me that those countries are just jokes in WW2. Actually in the game, I tried South Africa, Australia India, poland and Canada. I can say that except for Poland which u can challenge yourself lul, all other countries are sooooo boring. And this boredom also shows another problem of this game. It is not fun too play as a small country. At least, not as fun as the small country in EU4.Some Suggestions:1. Please pay more attention to East Asia and Pacific. China acted a role way more important in WW2 than you thought, PI! I was afraid I could not wait until Version 1.20(China)?! looooooool2. Naval combat looks so funny.

XuanKamoFurio	Not Recommended	314.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070333511/	I don't recommend this game, and I would predict this game will only be in good shape in 2018 or so.We are 4 months after the game was releaesed and there are still bugs and exploits that the devs have been acknowledge, but they bluntly say that they are not interested in fixing them in the short term. Also I point that some bugs were reported 12 weeks ago, and the next patch is thought to be tied to a dlc in december, so the bugs will be there for 6 months. Also for modders this game is a pain, I wasted 100+ hours doing 1 mod and I have been waiting for enough tools to fix a lot of absurd mechanics and exploit that it seems they will never come. mods can't be reloaded in game, to restart every time I want to test some event is a pain.There is not an easy option to get the clean version with the right checksum to play in MP.The diplomacy in this game is blatanlty shallow and it seem it was a deliberated design to sell the dlcs, pay another 20 dlc if you want a diplomacy more logical. The last patch was a joke in terms of content, after 2+ months paradox only brought sliders and new countries that a modder can do in less of 2 hours.Naval combat and interface are also in bad shape, but hey, pay another $20 and it will be fixed in 1 year. Air combat and management is sadder. Mostly because the devs know and admit how bad the design is, you must have thousands of wings of only 3 airplanes to get the max efficience. so there will be: another $20civil wars and coups maybe will be fixed with the diplomacy dlc, so no additional money for that, but it will be another year at least to be released. Also it would be preposterous to have to pay $20 to fix that siam can provoke coups in the USA because paradox leave this trivial mechanich with no fixes. lend and lease is another incomplete mechanic, you gain the same diplomatic opinion sending 10 weapons that 100 airplanes. Communist China can't receive lend and lease from USSR because is tied to convoysThe Sahara and the dense jungles must have more mod tools to make them a logisitic nightmare, but they were not released and I doubt it will be solved before 2018. the only thing that can be done to "fix" it is use a mod of no man's land.The AI is the center of most critics. the allies can lose 1 million of soldiers attempting uncoordinated naval invasions. at this pace it will be fixed in 2019 if paradox has not thrown this project.Performance is bad after the war starts, the game can run smooth till 1939, in 1943 speed 5 go like speed 1 in 1936. This happens with all the pc's no mattter the specs. in CK2 the performance was fixed 4 years after release, so go figure when will the ho4 performance be fixed.Battle plans is an incomplete feature, I predict it will be fixed in 1 year.It seems like they intentionally release broken things, that will only be fixed with future paid dlcs.Buy this game only after the 3rd dlc has been released and the vanilla game + dlcs are in a sale. Before that you will only get 1 good gameplay, because after that the bugs and exploits will make this a mononotonus game.

You are able to do this manually but you don't get any planning bonuses at all.

1 Volk 1 Reich 1 Wassermelone	Not Recommended	750.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198088718868/	After pouring more hours into this game than any other in my Steam library I feel I should write a review. Don`t be fooled though, because this is not going to be positive to the game. Lets start with the AI. It`s atrocious and kills itself if you wait long enough by endlessly attacking you or declaring wars they have no hope of winning. The AI has also got significantly worse after their "AI improvements". For example, Germany can`t get through the maginot 9 times out of ten, and sometimes countries will take all their troops of the front for no reason. The game is also inceribly frustrating to play, due to several reasons. The first one is lag. The games framerate takes a enormous dip lategame due to every country spamm deploying divisions. This makes the game incredibly slow, The second is due to how wars work. Once a war is declared it can`t be ended until all major nations in one alliance are capitulated. Now imagine how frustrating it would be to have to invade Australia as Germany after  conquering both Russia and the US. The third one is how stupid the way fleets work is. Your naval invasions fail all the time, despite you having full naval superiority, becuae they locked into a naval battle with a few enemy ships, and your navy refuses to go and help. The last one was non-existent until the newest DLC came out, with nothing in the way of playtesting, First off they ruined frotlines so that you need mods to play the game correctly. China (the point of the DLC) is now completely broken. I was invading them as japan and when they finally surrendered a warlord declared himself as the new chinese president. He then took controll of every province in china (yes even the ones I had conquered) and encircled most of my 100+ division army due to all my chinese territory going to him. now heres the kicker. I conquered China back from him and when he surrendered... Another warlord took controll of all my controlled territory. I hate this game, Paradox interactive are a greedy bunch of hacks who can`t be bothered to playtest their own DLC.

DogBoyGenius	Not Recommended	429.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kaiserlichundkoniglich/	Paradox has managed to dumb down one of the greatest grand strategy games they've ever made, while simultaneously making some things more tedious and annoying. The AI is actually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and can't fight for♥♥♥♥♥♥ which makes the game far too easy. I've beaten the USA with the full force of the allies behind it as Mexico, and the Soviet Union as Poland. Because of this using battleplans in pointless and you just have to micromanage things anyway. Perhaps once the god damn terrible AI is fixed and more depth is added to the game, it will be worth the money, but it will still be a huge downgrade from HOI3..

Zimmer	Not Recommended	573.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198010890055/	Edit: I'm doing this review to help this game better. I'm aware HO3 is a little bit complicated in some cases. So don't be offensive. After a couple of games my updated review below;----------------------------------------------------------------------First of all, I want to say that I'm not a perfectionist man regarding strategy games and this is my honest review. I have been waiting this game for more than 2 years and a fan of all paradox titles.But  lately something happened to great Paradox company, Stellaris and HOI4 has some  problems. Especially HOI4 is a serious disappointment for me at this stage. Why? Please follow details below;#1 Game has a lineer logic and flow. I have tried to play with Turkey (historically neutral country) and Romania (historically @ Axis side), I aligned (changed my goverment to Communist) to Soviet side and some AI decisions were so stupid. Soviets don't call  me to join Faction. I have applied and later Soviet attacked Allies, and didn't call me (I'm a part of the Commintern)? Why? Update: In my another game I go with Turkey and Communismi Soviet Union called me to join their faction. Strange?Update: Game's diplomatic logic fails in some cases. There must be a balance between History AI and Reality. If I change a country to Communism via Espionage. For example Yuıgoslavia (with its socialist leader Tito) should tend to align and join to Commintern not Allies.Same as Romania, tried to align Alies, some AI decisions were interesting. I think, diplomatic AI of that game is broken or has some issues in some situations. Maybe if you play with major countries Germans or Soviet you can't see that issues. If you play with minor countries you will probably face with such illogical things.#2 AI diplomatic decisions sometimes illogical. For example I have changed  France's goverment by supporting Communist party to a France Commune, but France Commune joined war with Allies faction not joined to Commintenrn (interesting)? WTF? In additon I'm a small country how can I do that? There must be a logic-limit for that diplomatic actions.Update: Germany is failed but started a lot of illogical wars all over the Europe and collapsed.National Spain get the Africa but didn't defend its motherland and failed.#3 If you play with a small country, you can easily change 4-5 countries political system by time. This is not realistic.Update:  With the points by gaining from National Focus tree easily, changing a goverment political system in some cases so easy. I have already checked that Game diplomacy AI does not use this method to Create natural Allies or not trying to blockade my espionage. So I can change Romania'n political system and Germany does not take any diplomatic action for that.#4 Trade system is not good and problematic. You don't exchange oil with civilian factory power! Exchanging my goods without my approval is not realistic. Please check old HOI3 and work more.Update: I don't like trade system.#5 Interface is good as visually but some functions or management of your troops (like planes re-deployment, finding your trops etc (not on the map) and productions are problematic. Game Interface UX is bad for some screens. Check EUI4 and work more please.#6 This is a political, diplomacy and grand war game. Army organization is so easy in HOI4. Because there is no Army organization.#7 If you research a new technology sometimes you need to upgrade your tanks, guns etc. But learning the upgrading process is a real pain not gamer friendly.#8 There' no ledger or any detailed statistic regarding on going wars except small world tension war tab.#9 Lack of Espionage and DiplomacyWhat is good?#1 Visuals#2 Organized and Polished Research Tree#3 Great National Focus mechanic, but it needs to be re worked I think.#4 I couldn't see logical issues on War AI, but some report that.#5 Battle plan is innovative but it may be a little bit easier to use.#6 Auto Synchronizatiın fix when playinng multiplayer (if you had an issue regarding internet, network etc)#7 Good combination of Political and Terrain Map#8 Funcionality of closing Day/Night Cycle#9 World Tension Mechanic#10 Great Musics and Atmosphere#11 New Turn Based War Result Deplomacy Screen#12 New Production CycleSome part of the game is studied really well and great, but some is  sloppy. I think, paradox will check the issues and make this game better for strategy lovers and fans.
Revenge	Not Recommended	54.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198016488565/	Briefly too simple and lacks depth... Plus AI can't handle game mechanics well enough (which it has very undemanding ones). Research system is nowhere near old HOI/DH/Arsenal of Democracy tech team builds, its very plain. Only thing I liked compared to old games is production system, rest is very simple, its like arcade version of HOI...I don't recommend this game if you are experienced Paradox/HOI player, its not a "Grand(!)" strategy game at all...
Asael	Not Recommended	901.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087765008/	I suppose I should begin with what I was hoping to experience with this game. Perhaps my expectations as a fan of this series were too highly elevated.  What I hope for with a new title in any series is a familiar foundation, revitalization and mastery of those experimental and ambitious additions to previous titles, and experimentation and expansion into new areas to more fully develop the experience of players within the series.  Having said that, Hearts of Iron IV feels less like an installment to the Hearts of Iron series than a new IP with a focus on gorgeous graphics and rapid gameplay set during a decade in the first half of the twentieth century.  I'll give Paradox credit for attempting to open up the world a little more than in previous titles.  Events like creating a Fascist USA have become much easier to do in game without one needing the confidence and know-how to get under the hood and creating modifications of their game or save file.  I'm left feeling that the system is a little too easy to manipulate and the game can sometimes get too far off the rails to the detriment of the current game (play the USA and watch Germany succumb to rebellion in '38) but these are issues that could be resolved with patches and DLC.  I'm pleased with this effort.  I'm also pleased with the new supply system and method of building units even though I've yet to feel truly comfortable with the mechanics there.  It's works in a manner that makes the creation of units more interesting and feels organic while adding options to put undertrained or underequipped units in the field as an emergency stop-gap.  The penalties associated with this sort of decision also seem on point and make such decisions feel weighty.  Command of your airforce is no longer a micro-management version of hell that often convinced the player to not bother with air forces whenever practical.  I'm not convinced that I'm wholly pleased with the decisions that the AI makes for usage of your air forces within the assigned mission and geographic responsibility, but another step in a positive direction.Beyond this, the game feels like a reversion.  The AI seems just as inept as that of Hearts of Iron III, perhaps even more so.   I do not believe it to be asking too much for a developer to have improved the object of the most commonly cited shortcoming of the previous title before release of a successor.  If you are new to the Hearts of Iron franchise HoI3 had a terrible habit of mismanaging armies that were left to AI control.  After a few DLC and some creative usage of the order of battle we were able to overcome many of the shortcomings to such an extent that the experience was largely positive.  Examples of these failings would be the AI repeatedly attacking a heavily defend and fortified strait crossing until manpower was exhausted and the attacking forces were critically under strength.  Presently the Hearts of Iron IV AI will engage in similar behavior.  Related to those AI failings ... this title has dramatically reduced the amount of information that it provides to the player.  In the previous installment if you had the default message settings still in place you would see that your forces suffered a catastrophic loss.  The solution appears to now be keeping the player in the dark.  If you don't know that you just lost 250.000 men attempting to retake Sicily you won't complain about the AI committing suicide.The AI was incredibly deficient in amphibious invasion in HoI3, but it would attempt them regardless and sometimes it would succeed to the great satisfaction of the player.  Presently AI amphibious invasion seems even less capable than in HoI3.  It's not impossible to fix this, but what the game considers to be naval superiority is rather opaque and player attempts to rectify the situation are a trial by error where you sometimes just strike it lucky and fix it quickly or you overcommit forces whilst abandoning other areas just get the job done.  Research is mixed.  It is flashier, but doesn't seem to have improved much.  The greatest improvement in the research tech tree is that minors are not hopelessly crippled in the world.  The greatest flaw seems to be a lack of depth and a level of starting technology that keeps even the mostly hopelessly backward and technophobic of regimes on a modest technological footing.  I admit that when Hearts of Iron III launched it was a mess, but I had hope that it would be resolved as the issues were technical.  I have much less hope with Hearts of Iron IV as the issues are less technical than a dramatically new direction to the series.

MonsieurJack	Not Recommended	626.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007605514/	Wait until it's patched... I have confidence it will be improved but as for now the AI is not good enough to deliver a fun challenge.Illustrative example:I'm Germany.  I send two units to fight for the fascists in Spain.  Within a week of their getting there I send them against a weak unit north of Madrid.  Within a day the Republicans retreat to Madrid and a few hours after that I've taken it.  During this time the enemy AI makes no attempt to reinforce and hold their capital.  Knowing how fiercely the Republicans held onto the city in actual history, denying it to the fascists for nearly 3 years against intense assault, I was immediately taken out of the experience after having taken it so easily.  Thereafter I drove south against no opposition, cutting off the large number of Republican forces to the west of the city who were under attack by the Nationalists.  Again they made no attempt to stop my encirclement and did not attempt to break out after the fact.  Having effectively won the civil war in a week with two units, I quit, disappointed.I am confident this game will be good in the future, but as for now, I'm sorry to say it's a big let down.

GrandArchon	Not Recommended	149.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004541662/	I am a long-time Paradox fan, and I really want to love this game. The problem is it is a Paradox game in a long tradition of Paradox games that lag out terribly. Yes, I wrote that exact same line about Stellaris.At this point I am just at the end of my rope with Paradox. I will never buy another one of their products until they figure out how code so that their games work well enough to reach the end of a long campaign. Their games are emersive and grand in scale, and HOI4 is not an exception to this rule. In the end, however, the game is only as good as it is playable. The sad fact is that if you need a mod to make a game playable, it is not worth paying for. That is where this game is. Not worth paying for.Instead of fixing their games, they issue expansions that offer fixes to some issues, without addressing others. In essence, this forces the player to pay to fix a game that should've worked to being with.Here come the fanboys saying "it must be your hardware." It happens every time I write one of these reviews. The problem with the fanboy argument is that it is not hard to find a multitude of forums on which people bemoan this particular issue. Look it up for youself. Don't just trust me.The problem is the way the games are designed. EU3 was this way to begin with. As was HOI3 (which I had to eventually quit due to a lack of playability.), and just this past month I had to quit Stellaris for the same reason. Sadly, this is not a new problem for this company. I remember the days of HOI 1 when they released a game so full of Europa Universalis (EU1) code, that it constantly crashed. A game that had a probem with save games getting bigger and bigger to the point that they could barely be read. I am not sure if they do not beta test, or if they simply lack the coders necessary to build a solid engine. Either way this game like many other Paradox titles simply does not perform.Here are the positives. The game is beautiful, engaging, and different each time I play. I cannot say enough about the playability and replayability options. But if I cannot play a game without it lagging to a crawl once the Second World War begins... what is the point in playing? I do not play it to prepare for the war.
[TGPT] Surprised Mussolini	Recommended	1,957.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034167617/	It's cool, I guess ...
Broseph Stalin	Not Recommended	1,192.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/purplepeppy99/	Very short into this game's lifespan and already basic features you would expect in an WW2 simulator are locked behind a paywall like license production. AI has no idea what it is doing and paid features are poorly implemented making it seem like the game has been a rushed product since release with little to no concern about quality. Until Paradox fixes the DLC policy and improves a number of mechanics like naval invasion I would avoid this product. If you really want a WW2 simulator right now pick up HOI3 when it goes on sale.

Mods add extraordinary longevity to the game, and playing with friends makes the game even more fun. However, watch YouTube playthroughs (like half an hour videos, cause the default tutorial is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and you won't figure out details), I didn't and I spent about 15 hours figuring our how to even effectively play this game.

zachgtaylor	Recommended	1,277.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012410752/	Started an Ironman game as YugoslaviaBecame a Facist and conquered Bulgaria.Invaded Greece with some help from my Italian friendsCelebrated with Pasta and Wine when we took Greece.Invaded Albania and quickly added their factories to my production power.Pushed for early development of Aircraft and had Jet fighters providing air superiority over most of Europe and North Africa by 1943.  Facisim spread across Europe like wild fire under the might of the German Military and Yogoslavian Air Power.By late 1948 All of Europe, 95% of Africa, 90% of South America and 85% of Asia and the Pasific belonged to the Axis Powers.Still England and America refused to surrender.Yogoslavia Nuked London, Brisban, Liverpool... still they refused to surrender.Three more nukes were droped on England before the German and Yugoslavian invasion of the United States began.With most of the Southern United States under Axis control Yugoslavia established air power over the central and eastern US and Nuked Both Washington DC and Phillidelphia.Finally the US capitulated leaving England as the the lone super power.Yoguslavia sent 3 small divisions to perform Naval invasions of Southern England.with in just a few weeks Southern England and London belonged to Yugoslavia.With the fall of London the War was finally over.Germany took 90% of the continenal US leaving a small piece for me.Yugoslavia took Greece, Australia, New Zealand, the Phillipians, Solomons, Hawaii and a most of the Islands that were formally enslaved by the Netherlands.Long live Yugoslavia!  Liberataor of the people!Before I post my likes and dislikes I should state that I have hundreds of hours in EU4 and CK2 but I have never played Hearts of Iron.Things I like:The map and interface all look very nice and are laid out well.The Units look greatTech Tree has lots of things to pursue and even a few that force you to chose A or B but not both.Creating front lines and battle plans is fun once you figure out where to start drawing the lines to create the advance you want your troops to follow.Having to wait for preperation or sending your troops in unprepared are both fun.Problems:Late game, game has tons of lagAt the bigging of the war everything was sooooo smooth, but by the late war years even max speed was a crawl taking several seconds for one hour in game time to pass.  I have a pretty good rig with a quad core running at 4.1Ghz and 16G of ram and an overclocked GTX960 so I was not really expecting it to have any problems with the game.  Will it ever end!Even though the Axis controlled most of every continent except North America there was no surrender so you are forced to keep building and moving units at an incredibly slow pace to the game lag from all the units. Even after dropping 5 nukes on England and 2 on America and taking Washington DC they still did not surrender until quite some time later... It seems to me the trigger for ending was taking London.  As soon as I took London.  Game over.Overall Thumbs up!  Im sure Paradox will work the kinks out and continue to improve the game.

♥?!	Recommended	968.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WulfyWulf/	look at most of the reviews for this game and you won't see many people praising the wargame or strategic aspects of this game, because unfortunately they are pretty weak compared to serious wargames. instead this game's best strength is how many memorable alternate/fictional historical experiences it can deliver with the tools it provides, which it excels at like no title i've played. before the waking the tiger dlc, i've spent 35$ on this game total. i've gotten more than my money's worth, but that still can't excuse the issues with this game as a strategy title. i waited a long time before buying this game since release and it is finally approaching a state that can be considered more complete now. this game feels more like a series of very passionate ideas with a skilled team developing them, tied together in a disjointed way, rather than a cohesive strategy game.right now, before waking the tiger comes out, the package for the game + dlcs is 65$. i'm not sure it's worth that much. depending on how waking the tiger turns out, this game could maybe be worth 60 dollars with everything combined into one package. hoping they scale the price of the full game or the older dlcs back a bit, as this game is not worth a possible 80$ price tag for the complete experience, as much as that pains me to say.if you catch it on sale like it is today, and if you want to fight the entire world-turned-communist as germany and have a war of 100 million casualties, this is the game for it

Some mods make you produce heavy infantry and such. So to compromise for this they made it really easy to produce Infantry Equipment. And once you pass a certain number, like 1.7 million, which is very possible with these mods. Your Infnatry Equipment goes round back. And it doesn't go to 0, it goes to the negatives. If you have 1.7 million it goes to -1.7 million. It's like Ghandi in the first Civilization game.

If your a history nut like I am you would love playing this game because you could make up so much senerios, such as taking all of the Middle East because you want to secure the means of prodduction FOR ALLAH! This game is depth as ♥♥♥♥ so playing the game at first can be very frustrating, so i would higly recomend playing the tutorial first but any way. I would higly recommend this game to the kind of people that really love history... my only complaint is DLC..... WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU MAKE A 15$ DLC WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF ABLITIES AND A FEW UNIQUE NATIONAL FOCUSES....other than that wait for a sale a buy this game with no DLC. 9/10

ihavealamp	Recommended	36.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005947553/	Hands down the best grand strategy game launch from Paradox, across any of their series (Europa Universalis, Victoria, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, etc.). Crazy amount of content packed into a game with a silly amount of options/choices, but with a streamlined system of managing it all that's neither dumbed down nor complex for the sake of complexity.My biggest plus, however, is the AI control system through user-defined Armies, Theaters and Battle Plans...The War just kick off in '39? Having issues as Il Duce managing simultaneous fronts in France, Eastern Europe, North Africa and Ethiopia? Avoid the mess of micromanagement with a few army groups, plop 'em down in theaters on those borders, set up some simple "go there" battle plans... and go! The AI will take care of the bulk of the work and you can see to whatever details you'd like.Long story short - too late - if you dig any kind of Paradox strategy games, get this. It's a winner.

Nixxa	Not Recommended	612.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198173453586/	Enyojed playing this game so far then Cornflake update kicked in with its new Chain of Command system that completely messes your frontline, you need allot of troop managment , redrawing battle plans, constantly assigning your generals, etc... horrible system to command which is not needed and game was functioning fine before it. For me it just killed the game with this dumb philosophy trying to make a realistic grand strategy game and improving something that was  not needed. Also DLC's are way to expensive, 15€ for some new focus trees and mechanics that should come with the standard game. DONT BUY any DLC's this game has a plenty of mods that are way better and more dedicated to the game then DLC's themselves.

Graytero	Recommended	399.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Graytero/	Hearts Of Iron IV.... a game with flaws but god damn it’s good.Sure I might only have 200+ hours on this game but I know a lot more about this game from the community, anyway let’s beginPros: One of the best things about this game if not thee best is the mods, without them this game would be dead and that’s not an understatement. If you plan to buy this, I recommend to start downloading mods for the game ASAPAnother great thing is the games mechanics and simplicity (compared to other paradox games), the new focus tree addition for example is a great new mechanic added to this paradox game and it makes it feel fresh and new like most of the mechanics are like. Gameplay is fun and it does make you strategise and think like it should. There are a lot more great things about this game but I can’t fit them all here, so that’s just a list of the best ones.Cons: The biggest and most frustrating con here is indeed the crashing, you could be playing a great game and doing amazing and then your game crashes, then when you load the save you crash again. Another issue is how stupid the ai can be, it can be good every now and then but however it’s usually completely brain dead and just charges your lines even though they are completely outnumbered and outgunned. Also, the multiplayer is terrible (unless your playing with a lobby full of friends with great connection), if your in a public lobby, be prepared for constant de syncing and lag. And another thing, playing as a major makes you very VERY op and the game is basically a cake walk. unless your a new player it can be a little challenging but you will understand.So that about covers the review, I might have missed some things but I don’t want to make this a massive review so I just covered the main pros and cons of the game.If your into history or strategy games I recommend you immediately to check out this game, you could play this for thousands of hours and you still wouldn’t have experienced everything. And since the price is around 40 bucks and all the content you can get out of it, you are missing out if you don’t buy it. Definitely around a 7/10 for me

Black King	Recommended	133.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009654367/	When this game came out i loved it. its a solid game with decent graphics and models. personally i ran into very few bugs and as Germany if you prepare properly you can steamroll even the Soviet Union. interesting events like the Spanish Civil war (seriously the Spanish are always killing eachother) and you can influence which way that war will swing in your favor or not. Now for the problems of this game which should be obvious to everyone here the biggest problem is....The Lack of new content which this game sorely needs now. I'm all for beefing up the content for the commonwealth thats totally fine, the eastern states, sure they needed a small buff to keep it intersting but what we really need are more interestign world events. frankly the world seems too quiet considering this is a globe spanning war. There were very few contries that were not affected and we need more content in that direction reflecting the reprecussions the war was having on the world at large. Now is this a good gameyesshould you buy it yesbut be warned in terms of long term content its not getting the same love as Stellaris or CKII. and those are paradox titles i Love but i have to say it the devs need to cool  it with those titles and put more effort and love into this game beause it deserves it.

TheJFKexperience	Recommended	850.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CoolMosiac/	I have played a lot of HOI4 lately and i think this is a masterpiece of a game. One reason is the mechanics. The Mechanics of HOI4 is amazing with everything from the production to the battle mechanics.One thing i have to critizize about the game is the dlc. It is worthless since everything in the dlcs can be replaced with something from the Workshop. Also some mechanics are locked behind dlc like "Request Production License" and "Request Lend lease" (If im not mistaken). I find it really hard to think the dlc is worth it at all.The way soliders are recruited are realistic. Unlike EU4 the soliders require training, instead of clicking a button and waiting 20-40 days ingame. Also you need specific equipment for the training. Like normal infantry you need Infantry Weapons and Support Equipment. And for a regular Tank division you need Light (Or Medium or Heavy) tanks, Motorized (Basically Trucks and cars) And Infantry Weapons.The Way you occupy countries are also pretty realistic. To compare previous Paradox titles, In EU4 you simply move soliders to a province with an occasional siege but in Hoi4 you need to move your troops into what i like to call them micro provinces which basicly is provinces inside provinces if you compare it to EU4.Overall HOI4 is a solid game. The dlc is pretty un-needed (as usual with Paradox games) and has a solid occupation system along with other solid systems within the game.

sum_stupid_punk	Not Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009782677/	The learning curve for this game is needlessly complicated. I really wanted to love this game, but its just too much. The video tutorials also leave out about 90 percent of the information that informs the decisons the games make and you have dig through a ton of players tips and guides. I honestly don't unerstand the reasoning behind making this so complicated. I've got tons of time logged into Stellaris, Crusader Kings and a little bit in Europa; but this one is just stupidly difficult to pick up.

AI cant handle a solid push of well equipted light armor.  Air war is not needed and the sea is quite pointless for allies.  Little in the way of varration between games.  The graphics can be a LOT better in some areas.This is a DLC sales machine not an actual game.... getting fed up with Paradox and their BS

Paradox does not care about its community, they do not care about making a decent game. I recomend buying it on a sale cause i'v still gotten quite alot of good gaming hours out of it, but dont buy the DLC, download Road to 56 mod instead.
Broseph Stalin	Not Recommended	1,192.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/purplepeppy99/	Very short into this game's lifespan and already basic features you would expect in an WW2 simulator are locked behind a paywall like license production. AI has no idea what it is doing and paid features are poorly implemented making it seem like the game has been a rushed product since release with little to no concern about quality. Until Paradox fixes the DLC policy and improves a number of mechanics like naval invasion I would avoid this product. If you really want a WW2 simulator right now pick up HOI3 when it goes on sale.
[1stTX.H] Sgt. McMuffin	Recommended	394.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mcmuffin1862/	Alright so, aside from the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLC stuff, this game is very very fun. Mods add extraordinary longevity to the game, and playing with friends makes the game even more fun. However, watch YouTube playthroughs (like half an hour videos, cause the default tutorial is utter♥♥♥♥♥♥and you won't figure out details), I didn't and I spent about 15 hours figuring our how to even effectively play this game. It is very fun, and I have over 197 hours and still enjoy every game I play. Keep in mind, if you plan on not doing much combat and don't play aggressively at some point in the game, your frames will die and download a mod like Faction Manager to manage your faction. You could say this game has a lot of flaws, but honestly, I don't care cause I just got a mod to fix it and moved on. Highly recommend it.

PerfectDeath	Recommended	216.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964112637/	This is a game made by Paradox, Paradox grand strategy games lately (Crusader Kings II and Europa IV for example) have been getting better with age as DLC expands a lot of the game mechanics to improve the whole experience.If this trend continues for Hearts of Iron IV then I would recomend this game.  The game is also very moddable, which is going to improve the game's longevity.Though, there is no hurry to pick it up if you are on the fence.  Hearts of Iron has always been a series that is very different from the other grand strategy series Paradox develops so it is worth experiencing and Hearts of Iron IV is going to be an easier first for many who have not played the previous three.But knowing the game will be improved much more over the years it may be wise to wait for DLC to come and the base game to go on sale.  Also, Paradox DLC will almost always provide some free expansion content for the base game, usually fixes and improvements to the game and UI so, it is always worth revisiting their games after a few months.Those who have played the previous three HOI games will find much changed in this fourth instalment (not going to get into whether they were good or bad).Some changes are likely done to improve the game's performance (simplified air combat, logistics, infrastructure, and unrest to name a few) which does result in the game running REALLY well for the first half of the game.I do have my own complains about things like game balance and the AI being a huge derp most of the time.  Yet I have confidence that paradox will tackle many of these issues over time as they have demonstrated... which will still take a couple of years. =PI have patience and there is enough in the vanilla game with mods to keep me content.

Red nuts	Not Recommended	637.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008593936/	I just cant recommend this game any longer, I had high hopes and I have spendt many hours playing it. I cannot however support the bussiness practices of Paradox, cutting the game into pieces. The stuff in the DLC´s should be in the main game, and I think many people fell compelled to buy DLC´s to get the full experience. I mean in the base game you can´t use air supply! WTF?
xd dab	Not Recommended	483.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Colesy_/	I have tried so incredibly hard to enjoy this game on numerous occasions, but I just can't. I can no longer play this game and have any amount of fun in it whatsoever. I've patiently waited for all the DLCs thus far, but today is the day that I finally uninstall this game, and hope for the day that the improvements it desperately needs, are delivered.I'm a huge fan of Paradox Grand Strategy games, and I'm an even bigger fan of anything and everything that is authentic (at least somewhat) to WWII, so I'd normally expect a game like this to be that one game that destroys my social life. However, nothing about WWII can be at all enjoyed in this game, at least from my perspective. There is no real strategy, no real planning, no real country development and no real choice in this game. It's as if every single thing in this game is railroaded for you to fail if you don't play as a major faction. Even then, if you don't do something the way the game wants you to, you lost. Normally this would be totally understandable for a WWII game, but a big part of what makes Paradox games so great is that you get to control every aspect of your nation, and you get to create your own piece of history.The gameplay is so uninteresting and truly feels like a waste of time the second you get into combat. There is no adapting to what your opponent throws at you, there is no feeling of haste or desperation at any point. You need to plan out exactly what you want, and are going to do from the very start of the game or else you will lose every time. It feels like I have to predict what my enemy will throw at me before the game even begins or I will be punished. A prime example of this is playing as Italy and trying to lock down the Mediterranean Sea via naval dominance over the United Kingdom. You can build as many ships as you want, you can research as many doctrines as you want, you can have all the latest ships but the United Kingdom will still beat you. Again, normally this is acceptable in a WWII game, given that Italy's navy was no match for the UK's at the time, but what is the fun in playing as a nation that failed in the war historically, with no real opportunity to turn things around? There is no fun in it.This game is built around playing the majors and doing their focus trees, that of which are so incredibly railroaded to historical events that aren't even possible to execute on historical dates. I didn't buy this game to play as the same boring majors time and time again, only to do the same exact thing every single time. I bought this game to reshape the world and define my own history within the backdrop of WWII. This is what Paradox games are about, but it seems as if the Paradox ethos has been abandoned here.Not only in terms of how the game plays, but the content within the game as well. This game has nowhere near the same treatment as EU4 or CK2 regarding DLCs and expansions. The first two expansion were lackluster and completely void of any meaningful game changing features. Waking The Tiger I felt was a step in the right direction, but it still felt as if Paradox was building around the game they already have, rather than reshaping it to a fuller, more in depth experience like they did with the two afformentioned games. The progress on each of these expansions feels astonishingly slow, given that we've had two country packs and only one major expansion since it's release nearly two years ago. This game feels abandoned, and I'm truly losing hope in the thought that one day this game will develop into a masterpiece like the previous Paradox games have become.
Fisch0557	Not Recommended	142.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197989008978/	Paradox is already starting on the moneygrab. Since im kind of a Paradox♥♥♥♥♥ i bought both DLCs wich came out till now. Pretty much all both of them add is Focus Trees for Nations. So basically all you can get from Mods, but for 10€ instead of free. The game itself is really good, so if you get it: Don't buy the expansions (Unlike EUIV not owning them doesn`t completely destroy the game (yet) because you basically need some of the older paid features so the new "Free" features work)

juggaloboys	Not Recommended	769.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006777126/	This game is very fun to play, however there are too many crash events especially in regular campaign. Then there is the DLC coming that will be giving functions that should already be in the vanilla version but are not. The sprites are better, and it feels like they definitely worked on the learning curve since past games to try to streamline the playing, but the crashes just make this game not worth playing.
Ana Maradun	Not Recommended	448.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/anamaradun/	Hearts of Iron 4 is a game that when compared to other grand strategies such as Europa Universalis 4 and Stellaris, it seems very empty. The content is not there yet, although considerable amounts of DLC may change this, it should not take DLC to make a game.6/10, but can not recommend.
Alder41	Recommended	77.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993690122/	I think, it`s the best Hearts of Iron game yet.My favorite thing in HoI 4 are AI generals. Introduced in the HoI 3, they finally doing their job well. For newcomers: in HoI 4 you can assign a bunch of divisions to the specicic front and give them an order to advance in specific direction, and then just click one button and watch how AI do the rest.Some elaborate maneuvers such as encirclements and armor spearheads sometimes will force you to move some of your units manually, but in general case you can wage a huge war just by couple of clicks.And this makes HoI 4 trully strategic game. Not all this "move each one of the 100`s units to that tile" stuff. At any time you can put aside all micro-management and act like a true overlord deciding on the fate of nations.

blumps	Recommended	151.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blumps/	Really in-depth. If you like WW2 real time strategy games, then this is right up your alley. Can control government manpower, trade laws, conscription laws as well as switch ideology. Then you have control over every aspect of the game, whether it be Army (tanks, infantry, support) navy (capital ships, subs, destroyers, carriers), Airforce (6 types of aircraft: Fighters, close air support, naval bombers, heavy fighters, tact bombers, strat bombers). Next you have research in 8 different trees if I remember correctly. Industry, Electronics, Army, Support, Armor, Land Tactics,  avy, navy doctrine, aircraft, airtactics. Diplomacy is AI controled in SP, I havent got to play in MP mode yet. That should be lots of fun since you won't know what people are doing compared to knowing how it will go by playing single player. For example UK and France going in on Germany for being too aggressive and attacking poland. You can now even start as a minor nation and ♥♥♥♥ some♥♥♥♥♥♥up. I played one recently as Romania. Before 1938 came around I had taken Greece, Bolivia, Hungary and was getting ready to tee off on Yugoslavia until they snuck in to our faction (♥♥♥♥ing hitler man....sigh). So I went after Turkey instead so I could have access to the canal by the black sea. It was a bad idea, because once I brought Turkey in, they sided with the allies and started to funnel infantry marines at meRegardless, this game will keep you addicted for hours. And more hours will go by and then will ask yourself if your clock is messed up since its saying 6am, because you only JUST started to play.....but not really, you got fully sucked in to the poop sock mantra and no you'll be stuck playing forever and ever.

randRange	Recommended	685.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/randrange/	If you want WW2 strategy, you realy can't do much better than The Hearts of iron-series. The base game gives much way for great mods like Kaiserreich. Perfect for a calm playsession.
Eli	Recommended	220.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096230576/	So I just hit 100 hours on this game and i feel like i have somthing to say.. so First of, if you want a faced paced world war 2 game this game is not for you, but if you like game like Civ 6 or the Total War series then I would consider buying this game. If your a history nut like I am you would love playing this game because you could make up so much senerios, such as taking all of the Middle East because you want to secure the means of prodduction FOR ALLAH! This game is depth as ♥♥♥♥ so playing the game at first can be very frustrating, so i would higly recomend playing the tutorial first but any way. I would higly recommend this game to the kind of people that really love history... my only complaint is DLC..... WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ WOULD YOU MAKE A 15$ DLC WITH ONLY A COUPLE OF ABLITIES AND A FEW UNIQUE NATIONAL FOCUSES....other than that wait for a sale a buy this game with no DLC. 9/10

Otto	Recommended	357.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/surfnbird16/	Edit Still fun as hell currently creating a mighty Italian force.Comparied to the overly complex HOI3 this game dials it back a bit and in my opinion making it more fun. You still need to micromanage to getr best use of troops but battleplans and AI work alot better and dosnt take as much effort as HOI3 where you had to build every level of your army from theater fronts to corps commanders. Over all I like it and will play for many hours.

Infanthades1	Recommended	115.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/InfantHades1/	Great game. Multiplayer is fun. For those of you who have played Europa Universalis IV, don't play this game like that one. You can use that playstyle to micromanage some things, but try using front lines and offensive commands along with it. It's a hard transition at first, but just practice and you'll eventually get good from experience. On a last note, never buy DLC unless it's on sale. WAY too expensive.

ihavealamp	Recommended	36.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005947553/	Hands down the best grand strategy game launch from Paradox, across any of their series (Europa Universalis, Victoria, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, etc.). Crazy amount of content packed into a game with a silly amount of options/choices, but with a streamlined system of managing it all that's neither dumbed down nor complex for the sake of complexity.My biggest plus, however, is the AI control system through user-defined Armies, Theaters and Battle Plans...The War just kick off in '39? Having issues as Il Duce managing simultaneous fronts in France, Eastern Europe, North Africa and Ethiopia? Avoid the mess of micromanagement with a few army groups, plop 'em down in theaters on those borders, set up some simple "go there" battle plans... and go! The AI will take care of the bulk of the work and you can see to whatever details you'd like.Long story short - too late - if you dig any kind of Paradox strategy games, get this. It's a winner.
FallenPhantomX	Recommended	512.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenPhantomX/	This is a very fun game, i really recommend you buy this is you are into strategy games, it's also very simple to understand(with a few exceptions that you dont really need, they might help you a small bit).
=AOD=Tom12348	Recommended	991.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262863325/	A game full of strategy and amazing replayability. Bugs do happen, and AI can be a bit bad at times, but overall the game is amazing and with more and more updates to come, the game will only get better.

oberstgruppenführer	Recommended	562.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/winvincible/	Recommended for those who are interested in the general area of WW2.At first, the game might seem to be exhausting to play with. Different buttons, functionalities, events, and so on. As a general rule of thumb, you skip the tutorial part of the game and dive straight to the gameplay. In HoI4, that is okay to do as long as you keep your interest in RTS games. I am confident to say that Hearts of Iron IV is by far the best RTS WW2-themed game out there as the gameplay itself is massive, immersive and logical.  Massive as it covers land, air and sea battles while you try to balance your country's economy and ideology. Immersive because the gameplay lets you think about the countless scenarios you could create. It is enjoyable too if you have a friend to play with (I am looking for one also if you're interested).  And lastly logical, as the game tries to be closely related to the historical events that took place or you could create an alternete history (ahistorical) scenario to which both cases follow a logical path as countries with different ideologies unavoidingly clash with each other.I highly recommend this game if you are an enthusiast or have a general liking to rts with a ww2 scenario.

Ravon[17]	Not Recommended	537.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197984996605/	The base game is hardly worth it and by the time the game has the features that HOI3 had, with only three DLCs, it would cost you $100+I've lost the only company that would make the great grand strategies I love and now they've lost me
Toraet	Not Recommended	347.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972766065/	I love the game but the AI barely works and instead of fixing it they keep pumping out pointless and overpriced DLC. Paradox does not care about its community, they do not care about making a decent game. I recomend buying it on a sale cause i'v still gotten quite alot of good gaming hours out of it, but dont buy the DLC, download Road to 56 mod instead.
Broseph Stalin	Not Recommended	1,192.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/purplepeppy99/	Very short into this game's lifespan and already basic features you would expect in an WW2 simulator are locked behind a paywall like license production. AI has no idea what it is doing and paid features are poorly implemented making it seem like the game has been a rushed product since release with little to no concern about quality. Until Paradox fixes the DLC policy and improves a number of mechanics like naval invasion I would avoid this product. If you really want a WW2 simulator right now pick up HOI3 when it goes on sale.

celerycoloured	Not Recommended	69.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047866239/	A great game, if much simplified from previous HOI titles, at least the UI is better. The biggest problem is the terrible AI. If all countries were played by players it would play out similar to World War 2, but as it is now the AI flops about doing nothing, or making stupid decisions that make no sense, like moving units away from critical front lines or declaring war on countries it can't fight. I really want to rate this positively but in its current state it's just like beta software.
TehArgz	Not Recommended	514.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198051514014/	First of all, this is a great game.  Second of all, the AI is not smart enough to play it.I stopped trying to play as axis, unless you are germany, germany will not be able to handle it.The bottom line is that it is a great, complex, immersive game.  It's not perfect, but it is good and with mods it could be better.  The AI holds the game back however.  I would probably recommend this game for multiplayer, but in my opinion, until the ai is improved the single player game doesn't hold up as well as it should.This is not so much as a negative review as it is a warning review.
The Riz	Recommended	1,271.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theriz/	Seriously, if you like grand scale strategy games, history, geography, Axis & Allies/RISK, alternate timelines/historical endings, and "what if" scenarios then I recommend HOI4.HOI4 is different from HOI3. I have found they have "refined" the combat from HOI3. Before you could just let your troops just go. You could basically automate a whole country. In HOI4 that is impossible. You are forced (which is good) to choose what to do in the game, what to research, what to focus on, who to fight, manage the size of front lines, the aggressiveness of your generals, etc. You are once again an active participant like you were in HOI and HOI2.Gone is espionage, that is built into diplomacy now. Trade is easier and more automated. Gone are troop ships. They all come from the same pool of ships you use for trade. Air and naval warfare are similar, if not a bit more complicated to learn their nuances.I like that you can modify the "design" of a ship, plane or tank using experience. I like that you can more completely develop a division and add more nuanced support elements. The generals and admirals (to a lesser extent) can develop individual traits and increase in skill as they fight.I have nothing more to say on changes or what I like about the game except that I like it much better than HOI3.Some notes: The scoring system is flat horrible. It is based on number of fleets, air superiority, number of troop divisions, number of factories and controlled provinces. On the surface it sounds good. Until you actually play the game. Scoring should instead be based on number of troops, divisions, ships, planes, factories and controlled provinces.You could have one fleet of 500 ships and it is worth 500x less than 500 fleets of 1 ship. You could run 10 states with 10 planes each and have air superiority that is worth more than actually having air superiority where it counts... in battle on the front lines using 1000s of planes.I use theaters a lot, but I note from screenshots that MANY people do not. There should be something that promotes the use of theaters more.The assembly line system should be more manageable. I find that I scroll endlessly when I have 90 factories of infantry arms going and 75 of fighters trying to supply a pitched battle. There should be a higher level factory management where you can assign 15 factories or maybe groups of 5 at a time that can coexist with the current model. Either way it's still loads better than HOI3.The front line system is great. I think though there should be a way to manage its length so that a front's length can be somewhat maintained. A lot of times fronts collapse or spread way too far out and too quickly. I find that I am managing fronts quite a bit to manitain their continuity/integrity.
Viper	Not Recommended	275.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/diamond3/	I would strongly suggest no one ever buy a single Paradox title from here on out. Innovation and quality development is long gone, and everything and anything they produce is just blatantly un-inspired cash-grabbing. Hearts of Iron 4 is second only to Europa Universalis 4 as far as rip-offs are concerned, probably across all of Steam, and they are both Paradox titles.Oh, and the game sucks too, there's just no depth for a grand strategy game, ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hearts of Iron 2 from over 10 years ago (or it's fantastic successor Arsenal of Democracy, which still has a couple dedicated indie developers touching it up here and there).Boycott Paradox and their BS.

MiniMoled	Not Recommended	759.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198208091608/	Game is pretty good, especially when working with friends however I feel it is definitely not worth £35 and most dlc is crap and can be replicated with the countless mods availabe.

Ellye	Recommended	72.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ellye/	It's a simplified and streamlined take on the Hearts of Iron series, and that is, for me, welcome.Even for Paradox standards, HoI has always felt a bit too convoluted.

(Mods are great too)Quite good multiplayer, if you have friends to play with.Cons: DLC is overpriced, AI deploys too many units for the game to run smoothly after 1945.
Lumi	Not Recommended	443.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sonycomputerentertainment/	Play the game with mods, and it's a fun experience. The vanilla game and the DLC fall too short, and the DLCs (like most Paradox DLCs) usually have content that should be in the game already.
Jackninja5	Recommended	295.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jackninja5/	What can I say? I've always had an interest in playing as a country in the 1930s and here's my chance. So far I've tried spreading communism with Stalin, kicking China's♥♥♥♥♥with Japan and did nothing wrong as Hitler's Germany. Of course, we mostly look at them as negative but in a way, WWII has also become a bit of a meme with Hitler and Stalin but the game is not at all a meme. I also commend the realistic options in this. This game has clearly done its research. At the time of this review, this was the most expensive game I bought on Steam and I did have trouble getting money on my account due to currency differences but goddamn, it was worth it.
Sir.Supascoop-	Recommended	341.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960686503/	This game is a really fun Stratergy with endless possibilities, such as...Making the British Empire great againMaking America great againBe hitler and do nothing wrongBe Poland and rekk GermanyTake over the world has luxembourg (Okay)Be a fascist Bolovia (Random aswell)I especially like the new Frontline system, it makes the game more challenging than before, as the Frontlines and offensive lines were a bit blank before. (Dont worry about those people moaning about how it makes you need more micromanegment, It a stratergy game...)There are a few bugs, such as the Frontlines assigning 1 division to the soviet front, but this rarely happens and usually happens when you dont use the frontline system properly (overlaping frontlines is what i am talking about, when i tried that, a couple of HOI4 months later they switched)The Modding is also really cool where you can make alternative history scenario's and set HOI4 into a different time, like a modern day mod or something cool like that.The new Cornflakes update has also really improved the AI's stratergies, before you could easily cut off enemy supply lines and surround them, now if you leave any state ungarded, they will try to take if before a divion arrives.Over all i rate this game 9.2/10 (very good)
CCMatt	Recommended	735.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ccmatt/	Simplified yet not dumbed down. Streamlined yet just as tactically and strategically deep as the previous HOI. Watching your armies grow is fantasic, and the planning is now actually important (in HOI3 is was just in-game MS paint). Despite the lack of any optimization, you can still get the best of this game and craft absolutely memorable stories that need to be regaled to your friends.My HOI4 story: Seeing Guderian-senpai grow from just 4 skill and panzer leader into a 7 skill talent monkey was amazing. His personal troops (which I have never changed yet meticulously upgraded) grew from 5 Motorized divisions into 10 Mechanized Divisions, 10 Light Armor divisions, and 4 Auxiliary Heavy Tank divisions. He, and his troops were inexperienced when they first landed as volunteer troops in China against the grow Japanese threat. He drove from the Shanghai coast to Beijing's urban center. From there, he blitzed into Manchuria, forcing his way into Korea. The green and feeble General had matured into a witty and clever commander, perhaps the immense praise I heaped on him was the source of his hubris. His invasion of the Japanese homeland was a success at first. Taking the Japs by surprise, he drove forth, Kyushu and Shikoku both fell before him, the Chugoku peninsula faired no better. But the Japanese grew a spine and threw a wrench in his treads at Kansai, the choke point that leads into the heart of Japan. There Guderian met his rival, Tomoyuki Yamashita. Time and time again Yamashita got the better of him. Defeat, however, was the gas that lit the fire in Guderian's soul. With only 20 divisions, at the time, against Yamashita's 37, he dared a river crossing against heavy fortifications. This region was undermanned due to the idea it was just too harsh an obstacle to cross, Guderian saw it as an opening. With only a few divisions starting a diversionary attack on the Japanese, the majority of his forces blitzed across the river, the schwerepunkt Osaka was surrounded and the mass of Japanese troops were simply fish in a barrel to the panzers IIIs. With Nagoya only putting up token resistance, Tokyo was smashed fairly quickly. Guderian, now a grizzled commander, leads 24 elite divisions with more combat experience than any other force in the world. Equiped with the latest gear and air support, he is the key to the Benelux offensive to circumvent the Maginot line.

Facisim spread across Europe like wild fire under the might of the German Military and Yogoslavian Air Power.By late 1948 All of Europe, 95% of Africa, 90% of South America and 85% of Asia and the Pasific belonged to the Axis Powers.Still England and America refused to surrender.Yogoslavia Nuked London, Brisban, Liverpool... still they refused to surrender.Three more nukes were droped on England before the German and Yugoslavian invasion of the United States began.With most of the Southern United States under Axis control Yugoslavia established air power over the central and eastern US and Nuked Both Washington DC and Phillidelphia.Finally the US capitulated leaving England as the the lone super power.Yoguslavia sent 3 small divisions to perform Naval invasions of Southern England.with in just a few weeks Southern England and London belonged to Yugoslavia.With the fall of London the War was finally over.Germany took 90% of the continenal US leaving a small piece for me.Yugoslavia took Greece, Australia, New Zealand, the Phillipians, Solomons, Hawaii and a most of the Islands that were formally enslaved by the Netherlands.Long live Yugoslavia!  Liberataor of the people!Before I post my likes and dislikes I should state that I have hundreds of hours in EU4 and CK2 but I have never played Hearts of Iron.Things I like:The map and interface all look very nice and are laid out well.The Units look greatTech Tree has lots of things to pursue and even a few that force you to chose A or B but not both.Creating front lines and battle plans is fun once you figure out where to start drawing the lines to create the advance you want your troops to follow.Having to wait for preperation or sending your troops in unprepared are both fun.Problems:Late game, game has tons of lagAt the bigging of the war everything was sooooo smooth, but by the late war years even max speed was a crawl taking several seconds for one hour in game time to pass.  I have a pretty good rig with a quad core running at 4.1Ghz and 16G of ram and an overclocked GTX960 so I was not really expecting it to have any problems with the game.  Will it ever end!Even though the Axis controlled most of every continent except North America there was no surrender so you are forced to keep building and moving units at an incredibly slow pace to the game lag from all the units. Even after dropping 5 nukes on England and 2 on America and taking Washington DC they still did not surrender until quite some time later... It seems to me the trigger for ending was taking London.  As soon as I took London.  Game over.Overall Thumbs up!  Im sure Paradox will work the kinks out and continue to improve the game.

Prowler477	Not Recommended	43.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198069177923/	At the moment I do not really reccomend this game. There is limited diplomacy that I found to be not extensive enough. The tutorial for combat is not very descript and if I am to understand the game fully. There is so much to learn about that the tutorial does not cover like unit templates, types of unites advantages, hard attack vs. soft attack, general skills and sooooo many percentages in this game that I am not sure if I want to take the time learn let alone understand.I won the war as Britain in the game and I do not feel that the game was very fulfilling. The best part of the game for me was 30 something hours in and I droppped 15 nukes on Japan for them to surrender which they did not. The game feels like an extreme resource and technology race. The game is fun at first but I prefer Stellaris to this game because the stories in that game feel more compelling. If I were to enjoy this game more I would like more quests with more diversified wording for the news headlines other than "the cowardly enemy capitulated because they were cowardly". I want more of a narrative of how that invasion was and occupation of the capital in the real war or how it could have been. LIke occupations and invasions to Japan were feared to be very bitter fights to the last man woman and child rather than face the "American Devils". Which makes me think that propoganda is an untapped opportunity that this game could use. There are records of civilians killing themselves rather than surrendering. The game has a lot of potential but for now is a very basic template and I hope to revisit it again after so major improvements (that should be free). Furthermore there does not seem to be any worthwhile war goals or challenges for the game. For instance, I would like there to be a challenge for lose less than X amount of your manpower in the war. After winning the war there is not a compelling reason to continue (technology stops, and the wars are over). There does not seem to be an endgame or goal to the game. There needs to be some way to research faster from buildings and resources rather than technology to research technology faster. I am trying to avoid saying that the game feels pointless. Also, for volunteer conscription the percentage should go up as the war progresses for patriotism for events in the war or, as I mentioned before, from propoganda. Like the attack on Pear Harbor, the Miracle at Dunkirk, successful invasions, etc things that surged volunteers and patriotism in the real war. It would feel more immersive if there was a news alert that said that due to this event in the war there is an influx in volunteers and faith in the war effort. Something I found strange is that there is no food shortages or needs for food. If you have an army of over 1 million you need a way to feed them other than building guns and factories. "Bullets or bread?"To sum it up, put some challenges or goals to the game for each nation and more narrative. The achievements in the game are not compelling enough. At this point the game feels like a glorified resource manager and not a very good WWII simulation. Finnaly, General Macarthur was an idiot, put an impressive and historically enigmatic General like Patton on the front like he deserves. Another interesting change would be if yoiu choose not to punish Patton for insubordination and having him lead the Ghost Army in England instead having him lead the D-Day invasion and some possible consequences written for that decision. Even the Nazis were surprised that we punished our best general like that! Also the story of the man that never existed with the false invasion plans that the Nazis recovered saying we were going to invade in different place besides Normandy like Italy and another coast. Or how Rommel said that if the Americans were successful after D-Day that the war was lost. Or the decoding of the enigma machine by Allan Turing in Project Ultimate! So many stories about the WWII campaign that were untapped and unmentioned in this game that should have been. Even the air Battle of Britain was missing from this game. Especially Churchills decision to sacrifice Coventry rather than let the Germans know we had decrypted their code!!!!!!!!! So many consequences could have been written for that decision! The Germans never even tried to bomb me. :(

PartyCheese	Recommended	226.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198120358478/	The game is really fun, I've enjoyed playing the game and watching it played on YouTube, but Paradox needs to listen to their community, the whole DLC situation is a mess, they need to recognize that if they want to keep their community growing, they need to add more base content to the game.For example, the DLC: Death or Dishoner should be included in the base game. But I'm not saying DLC shouldn't exist, im saying that it shouldn't have a huge impact on the game whether you have it or not. The future of this game is in the hands of the developers, if they want to make profit for a couple more years, then keep doing what your doing, but if you want your game to last a long time, then listen to the community, we play the game, we know how it is.But other than that, you've made a nice game. I give it a 7/10 (-2 for DLC, -1 for personal preference reasons)
William	Recommended	178.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameAndWatch/	i originally found out about this game from YouTubers, I am a big fan of History and Alternate History so this seemed right up my alley. When I started playing I picked Poland. Didnt turn out so well. So then I picked El Salvador. I actually conqured Guatemala but messed up the peace deal and made them fully independent. So needless to say I wasnt good at Hearts of Iron 4. Then I just started playing and kept on going, although im still not too good. Its a difficult game but I feel rewarding. I would totally reccomend this game.

Viper	Not Recommended	275.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/diamond3/	I would strongly suggest no one ever buy a single Paradox title from here on out. Innovation and quality development is long gone, and everything and anything they produce is just blatantly un-inspired cash-grabbing. Hearts of Iron 4 is second only to Europa Universalis 4 as far as rip-offs are concerned, probably across all of Steam, and they are both Paradox titles.Oh, and the game sucks too, there's just no depth for a grand strategy game, ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hearts of Iron 2 from over 10 years ago (or it's fantastic successor Arsenal of Democracy, which still has a couple dedicated indie developers touching it up here and there).Boycott Paradox and their BS.
dahogger	Recommended	775.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142283517/	In my opinion, this is a wonderful concept with a great developer but the worst marketer, like a ♥♥♥♥ing dlc that adds stuff for a few minor countries shouldn't cost 10 5 2 or 1 bucks, it should be in the game. Also fix the ♥♥♥♥ing AI. Iron man did a better with his AI, and it tried to destroy the world.   DONT BUY THE DLCS UNLESS U ARE RICH OR DO IT FOR YOUTUBE.

I'm happy enough to support the developers of HOI and buy the DLC's, they are fun and I enjoy them.Basically, if you're willing to support the developers and give them that much more for more fun then get the game, if you want the game alone and you're going to complain that DLC's come out that complete the game more then this isn't the game for you.
Napukka	Recommended	485.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Napukka/	Hearts Of Iron IV, The game where i create Greater Finland and make Adolf Hitler throw Joseph Stalin into gulag. This game is historically accurate, if you enable historic AI focuses of course and it provides challenge and is fun to play. I have written this review based on my hours spent playing this game.Pros:-Brilliantly made strategy game that offers different difficulties to players.-Installing mods can be done through steam workshop-excellent equipment and factory/naval dockyard systemlogistics, trading and gaining resources is implemented much better, unlike in Hearts Of Iron III-The visuals, sound and music are overall great, again much better than in HOI 3Now the things that Paradox should work on aka cons:-AI, you might ask "what's wrong with the AI", i'll give you an example: you're playing as Japan and you conquer British Raj, suddenly out of nowhere: Germany, Soviet Union and US declare war on you, even though you have warm relations with them and they declare war on you without even justification. tl;dr: AI sometimes tends to do things that it shouldn't be able to do.-Naval balance: want to win without effort? just spam submarines and naval bombers, everything else is total garbage.basically if you went to the war with UK, and you have a fleet larger than them with better equipment, you would say "I'll win these chaps easily" well no. I don't know why but it's just that the naval bombers and subs are more efficient than any other naval ships.-Not supporting CPU multicore: Games in the HOI series tend to only use one core of your cpu, and this can cause lagging, even if you would have the best CPU in the market chances are you might still encounter this problem but there isn't a 100% chance that you're game would start lagging.Even though the game might have some problems with AI, It still is enjoyable to me. as you are reading this i'm probably trying to kick Stalin out of Europe while playing as Finland. HOI IV is 4/5 in my books.

Constantine	Not Recommended	75.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CptMcBob/	I've generally enjoyed playing it, and I'm not a hardcore fan of 4x type strategy games (I've played a few space ones), so I can't really pick apart the mechanics like most of these other reviewers, as I'm still low on the learning curve as in I know how to play the game but a lot of the in-depth controls and choices and mechanics are still unknown to me.Having said that I suggest you "try" this game elsewhere on your PC before you buy it. The game becomes unplayable mid-late/late game 1944-1946+ for me and I have higher than recommended specs. I turned down everything as low as possible and I still get to the point where I just can't play the game, where I'm getting 1 frame a minute or a CTD. Apprently for some people it works without issue, I don't know how it does. But this late game lag/freezing seems to be a fairly common problem from release and from having played Stellaris (their space 4x) it's the same issue because it's the same engine.Not sure what causes this issue but its game that is CPU intensive and runs at 32-bit. So try it and if it runs for you in late game, but it.

NeekSnow	Recommended	1,184.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ct-Rho-117/	I highly suggest watching let's plays and reading strategy guides before playing, even with ingame toutorials there's still a pretty notable learning curve. The fun is drained a little when you don't know what you're doing.
Louberforce	Recommended	410.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheLouberforeNetwork/	At first, HOI4 wasn't my cup of tea. I have over 600 hours in HOI3 and so I was just used to the old format and mechanics. But after putting 40 hours into HOI4 I now LOVE this game. It takes a bit of getting used and it has its floor but this game has so much potential. It is the greatest grand strategy game on the market and it has an unlimited amount of new content and experiences to potentially uncover/have. Steam workshop support is also a greatfeature as it provides even more options to explore.

ihavealamp	Recommended	36.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198005947553/	Hands down the best grand strategy game launch from Paradox, across any of their series (Europa Universalis, Victoria, Hearts of Iron, Crusader Kings, etc.). Crazy amount of content packed into a game with a silly amount of options/choices, but with a streamlined system of managing it all that's neither dumbed down nor complex for the sake of complexity.My biggest plus, however, is the AI control system through user-defined Armies, Theaters and Battle Plans...The War just kick off in '39? Having issues as Il Duce managing simultaneous fronts in France, Eastern Europe, North Africa and Ethiopia? Avoid the mess of micromanagement with a few army groups, plop 'em down in theaters on those borders, set up some simple "go there" battle plans... and go! The AI will take care of the bulk of the work and you can see to whatever details you'd like.Long story short - too late - if you dig any kind of Paradox strategy games, get this. It's a winner.
Mankar	Not Recommended	35.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dovahslayer96/	Overall it is a decent game, but as someone new to the HOI series I must say it is frustrating as hell to learn and play. The tutorial is a joke and only shows you the barebone basics, so you're forced to rely on youtube videos or the wiki for everything. I spent about 3 hours watching various youtube videos and I still do not understand all the mechanics or functions. Don't expect to pick this game up as a beginner and just play, as you will get wrecked by the AI.

Missionaria Protectiva	Recommended	607.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/289052543728902/	Another masterpiece by Paradox.Pros:Much better graphics than HOI3 and a better diplomatic system instead of just declaring wars and either conquering or puppeting other countries.The national foci provides a large variety of choices, either historical or alternative. France can have its own faction and the US can strike United Kingdom. Also, shifting ruling party's ideology will change the nation's name and flag just like VIC2. Specific countries will even have a unique name and flag when they are puppeted by a particular country. For example, when you are playing as German Reich and puppet Belarus and Ukraine, they will have the same flag as German Reich and will change their names to "Reichsprotektokrat Ostland" and "Reichsprotektokrat Ukriane". This makes the game even more interesting.The new air combat system makes commanding an Air Force much easier than it is in HOI3.More complicated in equipment production and division training ( also more realistic since you have to produce the equipments like guns and tanks via military factories and production lines ).The battle plan system makes commanding an Army much easier than in HOI3 where battleplans are of no uses.Cons:I somehow dislike the simplified Theater-Army-Division structure. Indeed it is much easier to manage but I still like to see a complete structure under a Theater-Army Group-Army-Corps-Division-Brigade system.Finally, only VPs and provinces have there names while small regions on the map don't. When playing HOI3 I can say "I encircled an army at XXX" but in HOI4 I can only say "I encircled an army at this region in XXX province". Really want the developers to bring these names back.Lots of playable countries do not have their own focus trees (e.g. ROC and PRC, Sweden, Netherlands and some others ) hope that Paradox can continuously add focus trees for other minor countries.

It's another (after stellaris) really painful to watch product from Paradox, that came out deeply flawed, but unlike Stellaris it STILL needs A LOT of tweaks to be even remotely fun for grand strategists. Not worth the money, not worth the waiting.

The Riz	Recommended	1,271.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/theriz/	Seriously, if you like grand scale strategy games, history, geography, Axis & Allies/RISK, alternate timelines/historical endings, and "what if" scenarios then I recommend HOI4.HOI4 is different from HOI3. I have found they have "refined" the combat from HOI3. Before you could just let your troops just go. You could basically automate a whole country. In HOI4 that is impossible. You are forced (which is good) to choose what to do in the game, what to research, what to focus on, who to fight, manage the size of front lines, the aggressiveness of your generals, etc. You are once again an active participant like you were in HOI and HOI2.Gone is espionage, that is built into diplomacy now. Trade is easier and more automated. Gone are troop ships. They all come from the same pool of ships you use for trade. Air and naval warfare are similar, if not a bit more complicated to learn their nuances.I like that you can modify the "design" of a ship, plane or tank using experience. I like that you can more completely develop a division and add more nuanced support elements. The generals and admirals (to a lesser extent) can develop individual traits and increase in skill as they fight.I have nothing more to say on changes or what I like about the game except that I like it much better than HOI3.Some notes: The scoring system is flat horrible. It is based on number of fleets, air superiority, number of troop divisions, number of factories and controlled provinces. On the surface it sounds good. Until you actually play the game. Scoring should instead be based on number of troops, divisions, ships, planes, factories and controlled provinces.You could have one fleet of 500 ships and it is worth 500x less than 500 fleets of 1 ship. You could run 10 states with 10 planes each and have air superiority that is worth more than actually having air superiority where it counts... in battle on the front lines using 1000s of planes.I use theaters a lot, but I note from screenshots that MANY people do not. There should be something that promotes the use of theaters more.The assembly line system should be more manageable. I find that I scroll endlessly when I have 90 factories of infantry arms going and 75 of fighters trying to supply a pitched battle. There should be a higher level factory management where you can assign 15 factories or maybe groups of 5 at a time that can coexist with the current model. Either way it's still loads better than HOI3.The front line system is great. I think though there should be a way to manage its length so that a front's length can be somewhat maintained. A lot of times fronts collapse or spread way too far out and too quickly. I find that I am managing fronts quite a bit to manitain their continuity/integrity.
Luciano	Recommended	571.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Arschfaust/	Decent and fun game. The dlc gimmick they've pulled with this game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t though.
F1nnisher	Recommended	464.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DetectiveBatman/	Definately one of my favorite strategy games by far! Mods add alot of different scenarios like the Cold War era, Millenium Dawn (Modern day mod), The Great War, and the Endsieg ( in english; the Final Victory) which is the downfall of the Third Reich. Even in its vanilla game form, the game is challenging and very fun! Worth the money!
FuzzyCoat	Recommended	50.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099433715/	the mods are better then the base game

Viper	Not Recommended	275.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/diamond3/	I would strongly suggest no one ever buy a single Paradox title from here on out. Innovation and quality development is long gone, and everything and anything they produce is just blatantly un-inspired cash-grabbing. Hearts of Iron 4 is second only to Europa Universalis 4 as far as rip-offs are concerned, probably across all of Steam, and they are both Paradox titles.Oh, and the game sucks too, there's just no depth for a grand strategy game, ESPECIALLY in comparison to Hearts of Iron 2 from over 10 years ago (or it's fantastic successor Arsenal of Democracy, which still has a couple dedicated indie developers touching it up here and there).Boycott Paradox and their BS.
dahogger	Recommended	775.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198142283517/	In my opinion, this is a wonderful concept with a great developer but the worst marketer, like a ♥♥♥♥ing dlc that adds stuff for a few minor countries shouldn't cost 10 5 2 or 1 bucks, it should be in the game. Also fix the ♥♥♥♥ing AI. Iron man did a better with his AI, and it tried to destroy the world.   DONT BUY THE DLCS UNLESS U ARE RICH OR DO IT FOR YOUTUBE. 
Graytero	Recommended	399.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Graytero/	Hearts Of Iron IV.... a game with flaws but god damn it’s good.Sure I might only have 200+ hours on this game but I know a lot more about this game from the community, anyway let’s beginPros: One of the best things about this game if not thee best is the mods, without them this game would be dead and that’s not an understatement. If you plan to buy this, I recommend to start downloading mods for the game ASAPAnother great thing is the games mechanics and simplicity (compared to other paradox games), the new focus tree addition for example is a great new mechanic added to this paradox game and it makes it feel fresh and new like most of the mechanics are like. Gameplay is fun and it does make you strategise and think like it should. There are a lot more great things about this game but I can’t fit them all here, so that’s just a list of the best ones.Cons: The biggest and most frustrating con here is indeed the crashing, you could be playing a great game and doing amazing and then your game crashes, then when you load the save you crash again. Another issue is how stupid the ai can be, it can be good every now and then but however it’s usually completely brain dead and just charges your lines even though they are completely outnumbered and outgunned. Also, the multiplayer is terrible (unless your playing with a lobby full of friends with great connection), if your in a public lobby, be prepared for constant de syncing and lag. And another thing, playing as a major makes you very VERY op and the game is basically a cake walk. unless your a new player it can be a little challenging but you will understand.So that about covers the review, I might have missed some things but I don’t want to make this a massive review so I just covered the main pros and cons of the game.If your into history or strategy games I recommend you immediately to check out this game, you could play this for thousands of hours and you still wouldn’t have experienced everything. And since the price is around 40 bucks and all the content you can get out of it, you are missing out if you don’t buy it. Definitely around a 7/10 for me
✪ Hi, I'm Tyler	Recommended	275.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/KaiserAKM/	After obtaining 200+ hours on this game, I would say that it would be a great purchase, even though it is quite intimidating for new players, there are plenty of tutorials to help you understand the game fully, and when you had played the base game to your hearts content there are mods to help you enjoy the game. My main issue is that there some items such as battle plans are locked away behind DLC's. Besides those issues I had a great time playing.
HalhadusaY	Recommended	320.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198310442989/	As a paradox game fan, i'm not purchasing this game for its historical accuracy, but to simply mess up with history lol
Eradicator23	Recommended	313.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198064465466/	Get mods for this game, seriously. Some of the mods are better than the price gouged dlc paradox offers and they're free
=AOD=Tom12348	Recommended	991.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262863325/	A game full of strategy and amazing replayability. Bugs do happen, and AI can be a bit bad at times, but overall the game is amazing and with more and more updates to come, the game will only get better.
rmcalister76	Not Recommended	58.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118954423/	While the interface is much improved from HOI3 and I'm really happy to see the focus on equipment, the game is still a terrible dissapointment. The new batlle planner is great, except the AI is still woefully incapable handling combat on its own. The naval combat actually feels significantly worse than HOI3's was at the end of its development cycle. I find myself having to create very similar mods to the ones I did for HOI3 in order to boost Japan's agressiveness and sucess in the pacific, Italy's sucess in North Africa, and Russia's success in defending Stalingrad and Moscow.I certainly appreciate, Paradox effort to reduce micromanagement, the AI does not seem improved enough to turn over enough of your forces to it. In addition, while trying to reduce micromanagement, the development team has reduced immersion and pulled the player further away from the actions and events, which are what really makes WW2 so interesting. It doesn't feel as though they took enough learning from HOI3, which I think they should have considering it is the same engine. For these reasons and cannot recommend this game at this time.
dololwin	Not Recommended	170.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198026700251/	Hearts of iron 2 was a good game, in fact was a great game, in hearts of iron 3 there were no stategic or tactical management, only micromanagement of every unitin the 4 of the series they take out micro management of some aspect (air and naval war) but the land battles are frustating, no hard, but frustating because the ia do whatever it pleases.REally disappointed with this one.

mukuro.yoru	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mukuroyoru/	Product received for free
GentleMellow	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GentleMellow/	Awesome and fun game to play with community. One thing that I wish these packs had was some moderation(Ability to kick people, auto-hide room code). If you stream, unless you want to limit your audience participation a lot(Which hurts as a small streamer) you're limited to Guesspionage and Trivia murder party. Otherwise the trolls come out in hordes with racist/hateful inputted answers.
Tabsies	Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040604849/	Good game.
LydiaBreeze	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaBreeze/	This game is entirely too much fun to play with friends or family.
Solid Snake [VR]	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/EKITRINA_BRANCH/	This game is  Insane! 
Chill Penguin X	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChillPenguinX/	Quiplash 2 is an improvement over the original imo, and if you've played neither, think of it like Cards Against Humanity meets MadLibs, but it's way better than either. This is the headliner of the pack, and honestly, it alone is worth the cost of the pack. You could always buy the first Quiplash as a standalone, but I think they fixed the scoring issues from the first one. Round 2 no longer feels like the only round that matters, and everyone has to spread out their votes in round 3. The only downside is that they introduced a new type of final prompt that involves filling out a comic strip, and after dozens of games, we still never seem to have good submissions for those, making them kind of an unfortunate let down at the end of the game. But, seriously, 10/10. One of, if not the, best party games I have ever played.Trivia Murder Party is also super fun. One of the better trivia games I've played.Guesspionage is okay (rarely play more than once in a session). Kinda reminds me of Wits and Wagers.T-KO is fun once or twice, but it honestly just takes way too long to play, and the lack of a fill option is pretty brutal. They let you buy shirts of your creations, but without the fill, I can't imagine that they sell too many.I do not like Fakin' It. That game stresses me the eff out, and I typically enjoy lying games like Resistance or Avalon (they're board games, not on Steam). It's well done, so I'm sure it will appeal to plenty of people, I just ain't one of 'em.
Ratthew	Recommended	8.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mburger09/	This is a great game to play with friends or family.  It's an entertaining and funny party game for gamers and non-gamers as well.
MrAgLi	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAgLi/	If you have friends, yes. If not, go cry at a mall, and if someone approach you, tell them to open Jackbox.tv .7/10.
Raz95	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029494380/	This is a Party game: it shouldn't be played with less than 4 players.The Jackbox series are the best (multimedia-based) Party games ever and in my eyes this part is the best of the series (contains the best mix of games).All games in this pack support up 8 active players (limitless number of audience participants can partially interact) exept of 'Faking It' which should always be played with the maximum of 6 or at least 5 players to have the most fun.Best played with a bunch of beer and a sixpack of friends ^^PS: don't forget to charge your mobile phone in order to start a Jackbox evening ;D
DoppeyDanger	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DoppeyDanger/	Great game to play with a group of friends!
Spaceman Spiff	Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpacemanSpiff14/	Fun
WiccaParker	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WiccaParker/	I love the jackbox games. Great for family and friends to get together for a little fun. I bought this pack mainly for Quiplash and Trivia Murder Party which I played before with friends. Neither game disappoints and I also like that both Trivia murder party and the Guesspionage game allows just 2 players for when you want to play a quick game without a lot of players. Although, the minimum amout for the other games is just 3 players and goes up to 8 at a time. Exception: Fakin it I do believe is 3-6 players and not up to 8 players. Jackbox doesn't disappiont with this installment that's for sure.
NoirBrand	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNameBrand/	Between the first two Jackboxes and this one, I prefer this one the most, and just overall reccomend it.All of the games are pretty fun to play, although most groups I play with aren't really drawn towards guesspionage or faker (2/5 games). But everyone I play with loves T-KO and Quiplash the most. I love that you can also buy T-shirts from the T-KO game, I've done that a few times now. It's genius that people only need their smartphone to play.All in all this is an excellent party game, and over the older Jackboxes this one shines quite brightly.
Gyrosen	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrosen/	The Jackbox series offer some of the most fun on evenings when my friends and I get together.
CocoMonster	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Azuluris/	Great game for groups/parties with 4+ people; gets everyone involved and comes with a few different games.
louisianapurchase	Recommended	3.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiicommie/	Very fun for parties! Bought this for my 16th birthday, and it really brought together people who don't know each other but have the same level of crudeness. I saw some reviews that said Tee K.O. really lacked but it was surprisingly the biggest hit at my party! Unfortunately my grandma and mom walked in on some inappropriate shirt but it really depends on if you're playing with the right people. Trivia Murder Party is better for more vanilla friends, but if you have crude inappropriate fun friends with a favored sense of humor, free fill in and creativity games like Quiplash 2 and Tee K.O. are perfect. I didn't play Guesspionage at my party, mostly because it didn't seem that interesting and its not too much suitable for a party aspect. Overall, love it! Will buy Jackbox Party Pack 4 in the future.
Googie	Recommended	2.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumgoogie/	Great for parties or streaming! Expect a lot of butt jokes.
PixiSquare	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pixisquare/	Best. Investment. Ever. That's pretty much all I have to say. Most of the "let's watch a boring movie" friend hang outs are now bombarded with screams (of stress? of betrayal?). This game can definitely liven up a party that is otherwise dull. I've played 3/5 games from this party pack so far (with parties of 4) and this is my take on the games:Trivia Murder Party - Perfect to play with anyone! You don't really need creative! or witty! friends to make the matches entertaining. Due to the difficulty (but fair) of the trivia questions and the silly comments made by the narrator, also every match has my group at the edge of our seats. Highly recommended to start the pack with this game.Tee K.O - Your friends are♥♥♥♥♥♥at drawing? Their drawings will most likely win the match. The characteristic that really drives this game is a good sense of humor. I found that if you are playing with those who have a similar sense of humor as you or are just funny individuals, you are going to have a blast. A lot of our T-shirt designs have made us laugh so hard our stomachs hurt! Highly recommended for imaginative or self-proclaimed comedians.Quiplash 2 - A bit like Cards Against Humanity but you write your own white cards. This game can get dull if your party doesn't output creative answers, making the game feel more tedious than fun. If you like games where you get to reveal your creative side, give this game a try!Note: If you are looking to play with random players, you can always stream the game on Twitch so people in the chat can join with the room code. It is very easy for players to join the fun!
Razgreez117	Recommended	47.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Razgreez117/	Awesome and fun game! Everyone I show this game to immediately downloads it for themselves. Easy to play and fun party game for lots of people
Spindor	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Spindor/	The most fun you can have with friends, booze and mobile phones that doesn't involve a blow-up doll.
Ganfi	Recommended	29.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ganfi/	This game just blew the mind of the guys I'm playing with. Even better than the Party Pack 2, even without Fibbage. A necessary installment for every party! Don't think about buying it, just buy it instantly! You won't regret it! Unless you don't have any friends....then you'll cry forever.
Mattsfella	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198131714839/	A great bonding experience.
o w o	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/snareclaw/	After playing the last two party packs I didn't think they could get any better, but this pack definitely proved me wrong. All the games I've played so far are amazing, and I look forward to playing the rest! It also works very well if you have friends far away, as you can all get together online and play. I'd highly recommend any of these if you have several friends who want to play something.
XxLiLaZnBo1pC5xX	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xxlilaznbo1pc5xx/	A great party game to introduce casual gamers, newcomers, or just plain anyone slightly interested in gaming to since nearly everyone carries a touchscreen device with internet access around these days and there is far less intimidation getting a group together to play Jackbox games compared to explaining button configurations and steep learning curves involved in other types of games. Quiplash can bring some pretty hilarious results due to players' responses and each game is unique due to each individual personality and thought process in providing answers. Trivia Murder Party is my favorite game of the lot and is well suited to a Halloween party; the trivia questions are hard and it's great to have a mode where even players who feel so far behind others in points can still comeback for a clutch win. Guesspionage is an interesting game where you will find out facts that you didn't know due to the fact that a percentage of people who do a specific activity will be higher, lower, significantly higher, significantly lower, or spot on to what you have guessed. Fakin' It is the more involved and active games where it requires you to hold "poker" faces and have timely reactions to ensure you are "fakin" it and blend seamlessly with the group. Tee K.O. lets you express your creative and artistic side by creating pictures and slogans that can go with a t-shirt; some player responses can make for some awesome and comedic results. You can even custom print a t-shirt with the favorite t-shirt design which can make some funny t-shirts you can rock with your fellow friends.
ZachZilla	Recommended	59.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaqWins/	Probably the best of the three party packs, in the other two there was always just one or two games that you came back to, but the other games were just not fun a second time. In this pack however all of the games are highly replayable with T-K.O. maybe being the exception.
Glueman	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mewps/	Didn't think they could improve on the first party pack but they succeeded. Each game is unique and all of them are laugh until you poop hilarious.

b7	Recommended	37.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/B7san/	Party couch slack!Some games are upto 8 players!I enjoyed this part the most due to the diverse games that it includes.Highly recommended!
b28johnson	Recommended	23.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121723169/	Awesome party game! One of them is comparable to cards against humanity, but better1
Wontons	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wontonysoup/	Fun with the right people. Mystery Trivia Murder Party's probably my favorite.
Tandouze	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rubisnoir/	This game is a must if you want to have fun in a party or waiting for all the people to arrive at the party. With booze or without, it's always fun and hilarious!
Joey	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017595632/	Fun and interactive game that you can play with a group of friends. The game is never the same so everytime you play it will be fun!
Azualend	Recommended	26.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/azualend/	The Jackbox Party Pack 3, and really the whole series, are fantastic games worth hours upon hours of fun. This game is usfuly for getting to know a small group of people to having at a full on party. My personal favorite is the Trivia Murder Party. The sassy host is the best!
Hobbes	Recommended	39.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977664051/	Great group games. A lot of fun!
JonFC_Redleg	Recommended	47.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145480010/	Lots of fun to play with friends. Most games in the pack have a family friendly filter option making it playable on many levels. Bring your phone, select a funny name and prepare to laugh!Update Nov 2017 Still just as fun and looking forward to Party Pack 4
Braskus Maximus	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rorworr/	Great game for friends
Zatchel	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zatchel/	I tried it with a few friends at a home reunion and had a blast with it.I really recommended for people who are looking for games for5 or more friends to play, questions of some of the games are focused a lot on north american culture but its expected, so some of the questions might rely on luck more than knowledge :PHAd a good amount of laughts and friendly competition, definelty great.
The Fantastic One Eared Gamer	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135662264/	A great game to pull out at parties. Everyone has a phone, games need very little explanation, and all of said games are at the very least mildly entertaining. The best game is Quiplash 2 by far, followed by Trivia Murder Party. The game suffers from having a few games that rely on having a large number of players.
Chrismus Time	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chrismustime/	pros:- extremely fun with buddies- good for 20hrs+- would say all the games in the pack are stellar (except Guessionage which isnt really fun)- capacity for over 8 players via audience function- good party game to stream- good game for non gamers- good game as an icebreaker (i use it at my college dorm whenever the new year comes in)cons:- the time waiting for animations/tutorial/talking takes WAY too long after you've player the game a bit, needs a better skip function- the achievements arent real achievements lol. its a party game- i bought it for 24$verdict:DEFEINITELY a good buy if you live around a solid group of friends (eg. college environment). tons of laughs. just wait for a sale, the game is NOT worth $24 imo. maybe $10 but thats pushing it.
PixiSquare	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pixisquare/	Best. Investment. Ever. That's pretty much all I have to say.

Just Arthur	Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/justarthur/	Great party games.
Discount Spook Dane	Recommended	11.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/noobatron2000/	Despite the lack of friends, this game is still pretty fun...I think...
Torosar	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080801191/	Worth it just for Quiplash
Jaffa	Recommended	34.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jaffa23/	Jackbox is my favorite party-game series. The best part about Jackbox is that it can appeal to almost anyone. As the mini-games are quite short and simplistic, and the only requirements is a device with an internet connection. This mean's that almost anyone can jump-in and play, even if they have little to no knowledge about what Jackbox is. The mini-games tend to revolve around simple concepts which are, writing answers to prompts, drawing a picture, playing trivia, or choosing which players answer is the best. Each individual mini-games have their own themes, putting an interesting spin on these simple concepts while encouraging people to play creatively. As a result, Jackbox fosters a bunch of hilarious moments where everyone laugh's their asses off to something zany happening on the TV. Additionally the sound design, voice acting, and visuals are phenomenal. They're just entertaining to watch and listen to, and really adds to the comical atmosphere of these games. Although not all of the mini-games are fun though, as quite a few are rather boring. Yet, I rather the Jackbox devs try to produce unique and interesting games, instead of just making sequels to their mini-games, even if sometimes they don't turn out well. All in all, the Jackbox series excels at providing fun, casual, and interacting gameplay for almost any get-togethers.  I definitely recommend picking up these games if you want to try something new with your friends.
Tuofir	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102786010/	Quiplash 2 and Trivia Murder Party are the highlights, hours of fun with these two alone.Tee-KO is fun for a bit but can get old (and is a little too long).Guesspionage is a total snore-fest.Was never able to try Fakin' It since we don't play in the same room as each other.Overall it's a pretty good package, though I'd recommend Party Pack 2 over this if you want more bang for your buck.
Agent Clyde	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156708747/	Buy this one, then Pack 5, then Pack 4, Then either Drawful 2 or Pack 2. Skip Pack one, all the good games in it get sequels.

dirpslurp	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/derpynames2/	Maybe the best game in the series? had A ton of fun with it, kind of sad it doesn't have Cookie Masterson though...

similarly	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/similarly/	This has been my favorite Jackbox Party Pack so far, in large part because of Trivia Murder Party.  I've played this game so many times, and the people I play with adore this game just as much as I do.  I especially love that even if you die in the game, you can continue playing and even have a chance to win.  It's a very fun and well-designed game.

Dark_Lucifer	Recommended	6.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198287924852/	Brilliant party game.  Definitely worth the price; got plenty of usage out of it.  My favourite Jackbox party pack (out of the first three).
thuder.emperor	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zullianhafiz/	So I’m going to base this review on my personal and my friends’ opinions when we got to play the game together, this is going to be a partial review because we didn’t play Fakin it as I’ve read from reviews that the game isn’t fun at all.Overall, the game is really enjoyable to play with your friends for a couple of hours, this game brought us some laugh out loud moments and really gives you that feeling of togetherness when you have your friends over. What’s great about The Jackbox Party Pack is that you don’t need to prepare anything like extra controllers or anything like that to play with multiple friends on the couch; all you need is a laptop, an internet connection, and smartphones which I’m sure everyone has. What I also like about this game is that it caters to everyone; be it your family or friends, and is relatively easy to get into, as friends who watched for just a couple of minutes would already understand how each game goes (some of my friends aren't really good at english). Now, on to each individual game the pack offers;Quiplash; This game is the ultimate source of laugh out loud moments that you can have with your friends since it gives you the option to make your own prompts where you can add some inside jokes that are sure to give your group a good laugh.Trivia Murder Party; This game has the longest lasting appeal as me and friends have played this game over and over for hours without getting bored. However, as many of the consumers have stated, the trivias are mostly ‘American’ trivias that most people who lived outside the US won’t get. For example, the game asks which presidents where democrats and which of these people were once hosts of a show like Family Feud. It’s a damn shame because I really wanted my friends to not get confused 80% of the time by these questions and actually have a clue of what they should choose as the answer.Guesspionage; As you can probably tell from the name of the game, this is a game about guessing, as in guessing percentages. The guessing happens the whole game, it gets boring fast and it doesn’t really give you any sense of competition or achievement when you actually win the game since it basically crowns the best guesser.Tee K.O.; My review for this game will be taken by a quote from my friend; “If we drew the shirts and make all the words, why is our shirt just mixed pictures and words taken from someone else’s efforts?”. This game isn’t fun because all your hard work will be used by someone else to win the game and even if you win, you won’t win by using your own drawings; this game is unsatisfactory and the scoring system is really confusing.TL;DR, Get this game for Quiplash and Trivia Murder Party, and get it if you have friends who aren’t really into games but is looking to meet up and have fun, or if you have any friends at all for that matter.
Keavon	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/keavon/	So far Party Pack 3 has been an absolute blast, just like the previous two incarnations. It is by far the most ambitious, polished set of games so far, and without a doubt Party Pack 3 has the strongest games in the series. Trivia Murder Party is especially great to play, and it can get very intense. Now that I'm in college, it's awesome to go to the game lounge and set it up on the TV. I cannot recommend the series enough, and especially Party Pack 3.
blimpie	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/awsummsawce/	Jackbox is back. If you liked the first two you'll love this.Tee KO and Quiplash 2 are easily my favorite games of the entire Jackbox franchise. I do wish this had another entry of Fibbage but I own the first two games anyway so it doesn't matter.  PROS -Great for having company and it's easy to pick up for people of all ages. -Using your smartphone as a controller is seamless and downright awesome.-The gamemodes are sometimes influenced entirely by the creativity of those you play with, so each new player adds their own personal twist to the fun.(singular)  CON -You can't play it by yourself.Hook this game up to your living room TV, gather some family/friends. Jackbox is always a laughing-out-loud damn good time.  WARNING  : This game may convince you to purchase a custom tshirt... Not in a "spammy" way... More like a "I probably shouldn't buy this but I really can't resist" way.
OCHOrobo	Recommended	18.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OCHOrobo/	I took this game home during Thanksgiving and it was a hit. A great game for people who have family members who might not play games on a regular basis. All the games in this pack are a lot of fun, especially Tee K.O.
Solanum	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/_Solanum_/	 The good Simple but so funny! It's a nice game to play with your friends 5 different type of games all of them great Connect computer with TV, making TV the main screen and you and your friends can use your cell phones as control to aswer question, draw and get orders The bad The really huge bad thing, it's the game only have english language People with no friends will never enjoy this game! :p Final score: 9/10 
Zipperdude	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zipperdude/	Never in my life had I laughed so hard with my friends before playing this game. Best party game I've ever played. 
MasterBungalow	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198116041534/	Always a fun game to break out when the friends are over, whether they are all very close friends or some of them are friends of friends everyone will have a good time. Hook up your computer to your tv with an HDMI cable, mess around with the picture settings and it looks perfect! This party will keep you and your friends entertained for much if not all through the night.
Music_Phoenix	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156672426/	Again, as always, Jackbox has produced a great group of really fun games to play.  Some of them are especially greatTrivia Murder Party is great fun and tense as well-it really makes you double guess your own actions and your friends actions. Quiplash 2 is just as great as the original, probably better in fact. You can write your own prompts and the game is just improved in every way I can think of. Tee K.O. is an interesting concept of a game, where you design a few t-shirts and then come up with a few random titles-someone else will pair the two and then it will be voted on and the person who paired them will win, not the person who designed it, which we found odd but interesting. This doesn't make the game any less fun though, it is a great gameFakin' It is also a good game-however, you need to be able to see each other perfectly. Considering we were playing over Skype and therefore I could only see one person at a time because I was sharing my screen, this made the game a bit more difficult and so we agreed to say what we would do. It is an interesting game though, where there a different rounds that you can pick-for example, you will have to write something, hold up a certain number of fingers or point at someone. Everyone gets given the same prompt to do something, apart from the faker who either gets given a roughly similar prompt (for example in the writing round, one prompt was "the last book you read" whereas the fakers was "your favourite childhood book") or no prompt at all and they just have to try a persuade people that they are not the faker. However I am not entirely certain how the points system works. Another good point is that once you have finished the game and select to play again with the same players, it will remember and you will not have to sit through the introduction again-in fact, in the Trivia Murder Party this is incoperated into the game and if you lost in the previous game-and thus "died"-it will add "Jr" to the end of your name. As well as this when you log onto the Jackbox.tv website and join a game, the format of the webpage will change dependent on what game you are playing, which is a nice feature. You also have the ability to look at the answers at the end of the game via the webpage. In Tee K.O. It even gives you the option of buying the T-Shirts that everyone so lovingly designed. All in all, another great Jackbox Party Pack that is super fun to play with friends, with new more experimental games that are just great fun to play with your friends.
privatestockholmes	Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/privatestockholmes/	My family and I play this series together. We love that we can play it with long-distance friends/relatives because we are all spread out across the country. Even people who don't own the game can go to the jackbox website and log-in with the room code to play along. Fun, lots of laugh.
⊂(・`ω´・⊂)	Recommended	18.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/hyunit/	Really fun pack of party games. Loved Tee KO the most, Quiplash is always fun. Murder Trivia would be much better if it wasn't so focused on the American (pop)culture. Maybe we were just really unlucky with the questions.Tee KO was really fun for the kids (I'm a teacher). I wish there was an option to edit/customize the Murder Trivia questions. Would be an amazing teaching tool!Amazing fun if you have friends/family to play with. I would say this pack is the best out of the 3 on sale. Get it with a standalone Drawful 2 and you're set for tons of entertainment!

cs188	Recommended	117.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cs188/	Jackbox games have become a permanant staple of my livestreams.  Viewers love them, I love them.  I've found myself coming back to Party Pack 3 more than Party Pack 2 (namely for Quiplash 2, Tee K.O., and Trivia Murder Party).  $25 is a bit of a steep price, but if you're a frequent host of crazy gatherings like I am, it's worth it.
philemon	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/philemonnnn/	i've played all four packs, and this pack is probably the second best one. i'll go over each game individually:Quiplash 2:in this game, you get a prompt and try to answer it in a funny way. pretty universal game if you're playing with normies. highly recommend this.Trivia Murder Party:pretty simple trivia game with minigames if you fail to answer the question correctly. most of the questions come down to pure guess, and some of the questions are way too easy. i guess it heavily depends on the people you're playing with, but overall it's not the best game in the pack, for sure.Guesspionage:an estimation game based on statistics. it's a pretty boring game, admittedly, but it's an interesting concept.Tee K.O.:a drawing game/write something funny game. the game starts out strong, but lingers off after the first round, and then becomes boring. might be fun if you're playing with a bunch of artsy people.Fakin' It:a game where you're given a question and either lie or tell the truth about the question, depending on your role. one of the better games in this pack, it's better played with the max amount of people.overall, this party pack is alright. not as replayable as 4 though. 7/10
Mug	Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MuggyMug/	If you have friends, its a must.
sm0nkeyho	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/oofonsmonkey/	So I got this game to play with my friendsBut I have no friends
Croy	Recommended	19.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/corynewb/	4 brand new games and the best game from two makes a return. Yes I recommend this game. Amazing game over twitch with friends, immortal game in the same room with them.
Sarkoth	Recommended	175.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197969749884/	The second best entry in the Jackbox Party Pack series, the third installmant yet again features five whacky party / trivia games which can lighten up the mood pretty much anywhere except within an Amish community. They hate computers and stuff you knowIn Quiplash 2 you unleash your gift of gab even more than in the first entry, adding hundreds of new questions to the already quite vast title with the ability to put in even scores of your own custom questions.Trivia Murder Party mixes the usual YDKJ trivia quiz with minigames if you answer wrongly, spicing up the quiz but ultimately turning out to be the weakest entry of this collection. Still, "weakest" means it is still lots of fun for quite a few rounds with friends.In Guesspionage you guess about statistical values. Awesome for statistic nerds but might be mildly uneventful for most other people. The friendship ruination factor is minimal hereTee K.O. combines elements from Drawful with elements from Quiplash. You design your own T-Shirt with a witty catchphrase and use it to battle other peoples designs. Extremely fun until creativity starts taking a downward spiral, which, depending on the people you're playing with, could take forever or mere minutes.Fakin' It is a digital alternative to Truth or Dare, but just being Truth or Lie. Each player is assigned a role and has to answer depending on their role. The aim of the game is for the group to correctly guess who has been assigned the liar role. A really great title to embarass other people or just simply learn more about them. Usually both at the same time. The second best entry in this pack in my opinion and one of the most interesting games in the entire series.The Jackbox Party Pack 3 has probably the most balanced out games of the packs and is definitely worth your time if you're a fan of trivia and party games.
Aliandris	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/aliandris/	A fabulous party game. Also fun to use in the classroom!
Darkuodai90	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkuodai90/	The last two were good, but this is leaps and bounds better. Tee KO's art style and music was great! I would certainly buy merch based around it. Family Friendly mode was kind of hard to track down, I didn't see it at first. It would be better placed in the normal setting like in 2, but thats the only issue I have. The ability to hide the room code is pretty cool though!
[COZA] サスケ	Recommended	3.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SasukeCOZA/	Product received for free
Pajoncek	Recommended	46.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012003647/	Everytime we play this game we have a blast and there is simply nothing else like this. Using phones as controllers is a great idea and I wish more games would do this sort of thing. If you have friends that have at least a bit of sense of humor, get it and it will make for a great party. My only complaint about the game is that the Trivia one is filled with very US pop culture heavy questions and most of the global audience will be completely in the dark (and there is many of them). What I would wish for future releases is some sort of fleshed out trivia game where you could maybe choose the categories for the particular session. I wouldn't mind getting DLCs of this sort of thing either,
The Cloon	Recommended	1.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cloonman/	Long time fan of the You Dont Know Jack series, so I was interested in the Jackboxes as soon as I saw them.  Ive played dozens of games from each Jackbox, and while I fully recommend the first two at the low price point, I think this one, while great,  isn't worth it until its discounted.FYI: I have 50+ hours played, not the 1.4 it shows here...I play on a laptop connected to TV doesnt show i guess.The Good:- Custom Games - You can make your own questions... so if you are like me and starting to get repeat questions, you can make your own!- Quiplash 2 - Quiplash XL was always a party favorite with guests in the previous jackbox, and this one doesnt disappoint!- Trivia Murder Party - A new entry in the series, and its great!  Took a couple games to really understand the mechanics, but our group had a blast with it... some really great and exciting close games the way they end.- Guesspionage - Another new entry... Simple and fun game with lot of surprises and its more challenging than it seems.  The Bad:- No Fibbage - would have liked to see a new Fibbage in, this was a standout game- Tee K.O. - Mediocre at best... the concept is ok, where you come up with funny slogans and draw T-Shirts, but half the stuff you draw and come up with doesnt get used in the game.  Also, the mechanics and scoring dont make sense... instead of a tournament style matchups, its just 2 random shirts, one gets voted off, and a new "challenger" shirt gets thrown in.  points for longest streak, and winner... problem is if your shirt comes out last, your max streak can only be 1, and if your shirt is first, highly unlikely everyone will keep voting for it to win, so it didnt make much sense.  we played a few games and moved on, wont bother unless it gets revamped in the future.The Ugly- No You Dont Know Jack??  Why a YDKJ episide wasnt included in a Jackbox, WTH?- Fakin It - wow, what a mess.  Pass on this turd, we tried it a few times, and our group mutually agreed it was definitely the loser of the bunch.Fortunately with 5 games included, its still worth getting even with one or two average or crap games, cause three are super fun with unlimited potential with the new ability to make up custom questions... well worth the price of a 12 pack of beer for the hours of entertainment value, so I still very much recommend.
Miss Jackson	Recommended	70.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198091565868/	Jackbox has outdone itself again. I am so excited to force all of my friends to play the Party Pack 3 with me ;)
OGRedDeer	Recommended	15.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ogreddeer/	Would be better if they had mini games from the two previous games.still a great game none the less.
Dutch Cream Master	Recommended	30.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/JESSB/	Great game for family/friend gatherings and parties! 10/10Warning: most games have a couple of sexually tinted questions/themes which may not be suitable for younger children.Edit: There is indeed a family filter for most games but not all.
Fiji	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FijiVR/	Absolutey awesome. However, just one thing...On TMP on the Math killing floor, a bug can happen where your option will not select. No matter how hard or how many times you press the option, the option will not select and thus you die.
Vectorz	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sanikshome/	I bought this game yesterday to try it out after seeing the youtube channel cow chop play it and it was the greatest we played 5 hours straight.
KittyAutumn	Recommended	47.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198282638832/	This game is great to play with friends!
Daklog	Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/daklog_gaming/	I've played the previous Jackbox Party Pack games, and they were both GREAT! So, how does this one hold up? I'm here to tell you that.1st Game: Quiplash 2Quiplash 2 is a sequel to the highly successful game, Quiplash. You find some prompts on your phone, and you try to write down the funniest thing you can think of that may or may not relate to the prompt. Some new features have been added to this version, like the ability to make your own prompts, and the ability to kick those nasty trolls.2nd Game: Trivia Murder PartyTrivia Murder Party is a trivia game that is very similar to You Don't Know Jack, although this game is mainly about trivia, it also will give you a chance to play a minigame if you get one wrong. These minigames will range from answering math questions, making the longest word, or even drinking from a random challice that may or may not contain poison. This game also has a singleplayer feature, so you can have fun even if your friends can't visit... or maybe you might not have any friends, I don't know your life. But, the singleplayer mode is just as good as the multiplayer. Perfect for your Halloween parties or any other party.3rd Game: Fakin' ItWARNING: This game involves lying to your friends and family, so be cautious.Fakin' It is a game where you are either telling truth, or forced to lie. The game is best played in a Living Room or Game Room and not through a private stream with your friends, because you actually have to see the people around you. There are up to 6 people in this game, and one of them is a liar. People get a prompt on their phone, which will say something like "Who here would be likely to have a fetish for mermaids?" or "Raise your hand if you've seen Regular Show The Movie" and you would have to do a certain action. The actions include raising your hand, pointing to another player, holding up a number, or making a face. The liar will not get the prompt and will only be told to do the action. People have to guess who the liar is.4th Game: GuesspionageThis game involves percentages and guessing. The player in the "hotseat" will guess what percentage of people have done a certain action, the others will try to guess if the percentage is higher or lower... and that's pretty much it. Not much to say  about this one.5th Game: Tee K.O.This game is a battle between novelty t-shirts to see which person is the best t-shirt designer. All people have 4 minutes and 30 seconds to draw 3 pictures and 30 seconds to type as many catchy slogans as possible. When this is all done, everyone's designs and slogans are switched around, and people have to match up the funniest combo and slap it on their t-shirt. Then, the shirts are put to the hilarity test, and people decide which one will win.Honestly, this collection is the best so far. All the games are awesome and will go GREAT with your Halloween and Thanksgiving parties.

rachelcenter	Recommended	14.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198212493161/	I really enjoyed this game. The drawing your own tshirt game guarantees a million laughs - funny to see what your friends will come up with. I love quiplash, getting to vote on your friends answers is a lot of fun. And Murder trivia party is awesome too.   I've been a fan since "you dont know jack". This is a brand that is constantly reinventing itself with each release of Jack Party Pack. Whenever I have friends over, we pull out this game. I love that you dont need to buy ten playstation controllers for everyone to play because that would be too expensive. everyone is able to punch in their answers with their phone. cant say enough good things about this game. Sidenote: what this game really needs to take it to the next level is a way for people in all different locations to log onto their computer, go to one dedicated website, (or mobile app) and have anyone play together remotely. (because right now if you just go to jackbox.tv, that will only give you access to the 'controller' for answering questions. going to that website wont let you visualize/see/stream the game). It would be nice if JackBox offered streaming of their game through logging into their website. Because when I had people over at my house last night to play, we were on the east coast and we wanted some of our west coast friends to be able to play with us, and we werent very excited about the idea of streaming this on twitch mainly because of the twenty second lag. We ended up doing a skype videochat and I did a screen share on the computer so everyone could see the game that way. Setting that up was kind of a pain, because I'm not use to using Skype (and its also kind of annoying that the people who played with us who werent here in person needed an ipad or computer for instance to watch the stream of the video, and then a SECOND device to plug in your answers). It would be nice if you only needed 1 device.
Sir Wonkerton	Recommended	5.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043133437/	They've added family friendly content controls, but they can't control how sick and twisted you and your friends are. Open ended answers to Tee KO and Quiplash bring out the most laughs.  Guesspionage is a fun, middle of the road Price is Right type game.  Trivia Murder Mystery is the most intense quiz game I've played that punishes wrong answers.  Fakin It feels like a fresh, somewhat new approach to Jackbox Party Packs because it actually forces players to interact with each other and not just their phones.  If you actually have friends, all of these games would play better with more people, especially Fakin' It.
Black Bean Salsa	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zacmun/	I bought the first game on a Steam Sale, but loved it so much that I bought the second one at full price and bought this third one almost as soon as it released. Definitely worth it. If I had a nickel for every time I've packed my laptop to a house party JUST FOR THIS GAME, I'd have enough money to buy the trilogy. You just need your laptop and an internet connection to start it up. Listen, the game uses your phone as the controller, which means literally every single person you ask to play with you immediately have a frame of reference for how it works. That's priceless. No teaching controls, no explaining mechanics, just "look at the TV, go to that site, enter the code." I don't care if you have an Android, iPhone, or cheap knockoff iPad; if you have an internet browser, you can play this game. The games offer the prompt, then your phone's browser lets you submit your response. Super easy. I've seen socially reserved people suddenly become the funniest f***er at the party, not because they're social butterflies, but because they were witty with their lies on Fibbage. PLUS, the games are presented in such a way that it can behave like either Apples to Apples or Cards Against Humanity. It's good to play with kids, college students, or adults and still have a good time. The prompts are never inappropriate, but you're responses can definitely be. Players can adapt the game to suit your own friend bubble's sense of humor and it's brilliantly handled. There's also a secondary prize in most games (the best ones at least) based on who had the most liked responses, which people can pick after the answer has been revealed.This one comes with 5 games and all of the best ones have an 8 player cap. Each game takes about 10-15 minutes to play, but they have TONS of questions and prompts, so you'll almost never hit one you've seen before and it's pretty easy to corral people to try it out because of the play time. Each game has an announcer that briefly explains the game and the rules, while also presenting the prompts. They're sorta funny; they get some laughs for being super cheesy. You won't want to turn it off for being annoying, at least. They're a little self aware, honestly. Quiplash 2 and Trivia Murder Party are THE games you need, though. Quiplash X is the first game you're buying this for. At the start of the game, everyone gets two prompts that they have to make up a response for. Prompts could be like "A sitcom where two pairs of twins marry each other" or "Titanic 2: _______". The catch is that one other player has your same prompt, and everyone is going to vote on the best response of the two. You get points based on the number of votes you get. Sounds simple, but that's why it's so good. It's probably the most approachable Jackbox game. Trivia Murder Party is basically a trivia game, only you're trapped in a basement and the bad guy from SAW is going to take you out one on one based on who gets the answers wrong. It's pretty fun, has a lot of diversions, and promotes just the right level of competition. You really have to play it to get how it works, but I like it and I don't even usually like trivia games.Guesspionage is pretty funny. You basically guess at statistics and get points for how close you were. Prompts can be anything from "Percentage of people who make their beds in a hotel room" or "Percentage of people who enjoy pickles." It's pretty funny and a good conversation starter.Tee K.O. is like Pictionary, except you're prompts are for T-Shirt designs, every prompt is given to two random people, and everyone else votes on the best one. You make the drawing using your touchscreen and get points based on the number of votes you got. It's basically like a blend of Drawful and Quiplash. Pretty fun and rounds off the pack nicely.Fakin' It is basically a "Who is the spy" game. It's alright.You get a prompt and have to raise your hand if it's true. People can call you out if they think you're lying, so there's a good balance between telling the truth and lying just to avoid being called out.Seriously, though. Get this. It's a great game to break out at a party or just with a small group of friends and super easy to set up.
Chrisaltosax	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chrisaltosax/	After buying Jackbox 3 I haver begun taking my laptop with me to gatherings because we always end up hooking it up to the TV and playing a few rounds. Everyone in my age group has a smart phone, and as long as I hook everything up it's super simple!
Pake	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pakeiscake/	Jackbox Party Pack 3 is most likely the best pack so far in the entire series and quite honestly even topples the 4th. The game has 5 different games that are all so good and hilarious with the perfect elements of: lying, drawing, trivia, and competition. This is a must in the series compared to any others the games in the current versions are just to good. A perfect party game imo.+5 Different games+Quiplash is brought back and is my all time favorite Jackbox game+Quiplash now allows you to create your own episode of 64 prompts+Audience mode+Guesspionage is one of the best trivia games so far, giving the player an option to pick a percentage they think qualifies for the answer and the rest vote if it’s higher or lower. I’ve played this one so much it's just so addicting+Tee K.O is literally Quiplash and Drawful combined! Holy ♥♥♥♥. Although it may be long the game is great and has the players draw anything they want with a bunch of colors and colored backgrounds to choose from. They then enter random captions to then get a random drawing that isn’t theirs and a set for 4 random captions that they have to pick one to match with the shirt, then everyone picks their favorite combos. This then repeats again until the final set of favorite shirts compete. The ultimate game!+Trivia Murder Party is pretty hard as the game focuses on asking the players a trivia question with four answers and it punishes the players very harshly if they do not answer correctly. Anyone who answers wrong is given a random mini-game to complete to stay alive which can be more or not depending on how you interpret it. This can kill a player though they can still play and win. +Fakin’ It is a great altogether party game by far it’s very interactive and also is kinda fun on getting to know people more by it. Esseintely one player is the faker and everyone else is given a prompt and have to react to in a way and the faker has to try to blend in, after every round everyone picks who they think the faker is to win.-Felt that the prompts for the custom episodes in Quiplash 2 go by to fast, I understand there is no announcer to read the question but they run by to fast making me read the answers first-Trivia Murder Party seemed way to hard and the trivia was really hard with the punishments making it so hard my party would rarely get to the final round-Tee K.O. seemed to longOverall Jackbox 3 is a great game although some games might have some slight issues the game is so fantastic and has many games in great versions compared to the previous two which have had bad games this one delivers so much by having every game so great! Fantastic and a must buy for any party or group of friends/family.
Boxie	Recommended	2.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/boxie/	Had a bunch of fun with some friends.what is more amazing - it works on Linux (even though it is not advertised)!(plasma5, mesa 18(git), radeonsi, 4.15 kernel)
catch723	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198418741892/	when we play FAKE IT, i guess you need more than 3 people.  90% of the time it is the same faker.
The-TJ	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheTJ_132/	There are a few requirements to play, but you absolutely cannot go wrong with this game once you get past needing decent Internet and friends (T^T) you can be in the same room with. I recommend playing Tee K.O. and you can buy a physical shirt that you make in game. Good stuff!
joshtwise	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198061892967/	This game is best when mixed with alcohol and good friends. :D
Emerald Assassin	Recommended	20.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/emeraldassassin/	Me and my friends played this game at a sleepover LAN party for six hours and still weren't bored! Even though I paid only $15 through another site, it was still an amazing purchase that I really recommend. I will definitely be using this game more at parties and other social events, as it's a blast!
Techbane	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/techbane/	Jackbox continues their streak of pushing out some of the best party games in history, with the trifecta of Quiplash 2, Tee K.O., and Trivia Murder Party being the highlights of this pack. Guesspionage is alright but the actual outcomes seem to have been polled from a completely different pocket gathering of social outliers for almost every single question, and Fakin' It relies on both physical presence and the sort of on-the-spot improvisation that is probably not the forté of most of the Steam audience.Quiplash 2, along with its new bag of prompts, adds the ability to make collections of your own which can be amazing but is otherwise basically the same, Last Lashes excepted. I don't think the Last Lashes are as good, but that's a minor quibble. Tee K.O. is a genius sort of mashup of Drawful and Mad Libs that's a bit drawn out but can have amazing payoff. Trivia Murder Party is probably the most high-octane quiz game I've ever played, and genuinely starts pitting people against each other in surprising ways.Good value, good pack, good online functionality with the right streaming services (hint: pretty much anything but twitch). Worth it.
Homncruse	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/homncruse/	Definitely a great way to lose all of your friends.
Bup	Recommended	22.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/meyouyoume/	Oh my god! If you can get 4 adults/teens in one room, holy Crap, you will love what this thing has to offer.

Mr. Gatuso	Recommended	15.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mrgatuso1/	Jackbox Games does a great job on developing the best games for family or friend meetings. In Jackbox Party Pack 3, they give us the best games to play with. Within this pack, I can truly say that three games will be worth the price. These games are The Trivia Murder Party, Quiplash 2 and Fakin' It. Don't get me wrong, all included games are fun to play with your mates, but those I mentioned before are the ones that you will be playing the most since are the most action-paced and marvelous of all. I played with my mates on launch day and we had a blast! The action-paced and somewhat scary TMP (Trivia Murder Party) is the best game, in my own opinion, in the package since that was the one which we played the most. Fakin' It is a must play if playing with your best friends since it reveals nasty and funny secrets that may have committed (not in a negative way by the way). Quiplash 2 is the sequel of the most played game from the other game (JPP 2). We get more challenging and funny promtps to write and compete with. As for the other two games, I don't know how to describe them; additionally, they are not horrendous games but they deserve a chance to be played.I give this game a full recommendation.
Codrin Bradea : Satana	Recommended	23.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CodrinBradea/	All my friends are liars
Bigshot Eagle	Recommended	10.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bigshoteagle/	Starting off this review, I would just like to point out that I’ve bought Jackbox 1,2 and 3 on sale or in a pack. I originally bought Jackbox Party Pack 3 since the staff members of an old server really wanted to play together. As time moved on and the server shut down we set up a new community and use Jackbox as an activity streaming it through Twitch. Old man rant over, review starts now.This game is the perfect party game, I’ve played it with family, friends and random people on the internet. It's easy to set up and only requires one purchase of the game for the group that you're with which is a really great feature.“My Paul Walker joke was better than your joke about Kevin Spacey, how come you got a Quiplash!”There are 5 different games included in this pack: Quiplash 2This game is all about answering questions and making the most inside jokes you possibly can or you can lowball and joke about a dead celebrity. Your peers will either shower you in praise or make you feel bad about yourself. Very close to my favourite game here. Trivia Murder PartyTrying to answer impossible questions by googling them as quickly as possible and still losing. Ending up dead and chasing your teammates since they’re better at googling than you are. I try to avoid this game. GuesspionageGuessing how much people do a certain thing and being completely disgusted by the answer. My positive experience was my younger brother picking the terrorist looking dude that just whispers “Secrets” in a seductive voice. Tee K.O.My favourite game of the pack. Write a load of terrible quotes and get them put on a shirt with a swastika or a picture of the twin towers. Some of the shirts I’ve seen in this game have been creative. The most memorable one for me being ‘Forrest Gump deleted scene’ with a picture of a poorly drawn green man being attacked by spiders. Fakin' ItIgnoring a very easy name pun here, this game is good. You can only really play this in person, you’d have to be very clever to get this to work on stream and the delay wouldn’t help either. If you have a great poker face you will win this most of the time, my dad seems to be the champion of this game. The hardest part is getting everyone to work with you to vote the liar out, usually you’re wrong and make a fool of yourself but that’s all part of the fun. Unfortunately, you will get caught out when you try to bluff and answer that you hate Terry Crews. Every single person in the room realises that you’re lying.Audience members playing along with you makes this game even better. Whether, you’re chilling at home with your family for Christmas or hosting a live stream for your community, this is the perfect party game. I’d recommend getting the bundle from Fanatical if you want a great price on the game.I’d rate this game 17 overused Spacey jokes out of 18
RpgCritical	Recommended	38.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rpggentleman/	Step 1: Open the game.Step 2: Play Quiplash 2 with friendsStep 3: Find out you can make your own promptStep 4: Proceed to make 64 questions all about asexual animalsStep 5: ????Step 6: Profit10/10 would pick "forever alone via budding" again.
The Observer	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Cagneon/	This series is probably my favorite set of party games. Enjoy playing with friends or strangers, it's really just a blast. If a friend of yours says no to jackbox, you chain them to that couch and make them play, as nothing human can possible resist the good times Jackbox games provide.
AceOfAllTrades	Recommended	17.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/georgeguy/	Best Jackbox! A must buy if you have +6 people over to your place.
KhaLilWayne	Recommended	22.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/khalilwayne/	Played it with my family and we loved it! A must-by for anyone in the mood to have a good time at a party.
Biodredd	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/biodredd/	Jackbox 3 is another fun entry in the Party Pack series. More great unique games with that unusual twist. The latest version of Quiplash allow you to make your own set of games and clues. Tee K.O. allows you to purchase t-shirts of some of the game winning creations. Had an issue with the Murder Trivia game as the voice of the host is so modulated it was difficult to understand for a good portion of the game. Over all a great entry in the series withe my favorite being Guesspionage, a game where you have to figure out if the percentage of a given fact is correct by gessing if it should be higher or lower. Lots of fun. Check it out.

AdventureApollo	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AdventureApollo/	Better than buying a ton of party games. Just connect a computer to  a TV and pressure one of your friends to play with you and the whole party joins in.
carlosftw	Recommended	29.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Carlosftw/	Best party game of 2016. Absolutely genius how accessible this game is for friends and family who don't even play videogames. A must for gatherings or holidays.
JukeBox Legend	Recommended	18.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043963847/	As soon as it came out me and my friends purchased it, we had fun, all the games are great and really good this time around, we stream it and play over the internet. The only game we couldnt play was Fakin' it, due to not all of us having a web cam. Other wise we had a lot of fun and this was the best out of all the Jackbox Party packs. I can't wait to play it again with all my friends and just have fun.
rolo969	Not Recommended	5.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164527863/	I would recommend the Jackbox Party Pack 2 over this. Fakin it is the only good new game. Guesspionage and Tee KO are pretty average. The real dissapoinment is Trivia Murder Party. Despite a great presentation the questions are extremely American. Questions about state borders, girl scout cookie flavours, ivy league universities and american idol. The list goes on. One mini game didn't even accept a correctly spelled word since the americanised version of the word is different. 
SpiritMain BigBrain	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MalikaPlays/	Jackbox Party Pack is one of my favorite packs. My favorite game to play on stream is Murder Trivia Party, and you also get the classic Quiplash 2 in this pack. Worth for those two.
Glowcloud	Recommended	38.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/somethingeasy/	A great way to prove to yourself and all your friends that you are terrible people.
joey fatone	Not Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shipon11/	Although I love the Jackbox series, this is by far the weakest. The games are kinda pushing the limits and if your friends aren't creative enough, it'll get boring. I highly recommend grabbing and playing Party Pack 2 and Drawful 2 before sinking your teeth into this one. I had my fun with it, but at the end of the night we still went back to play Party Pack 2
serener	Recommended	21.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/serenerisawiener/	This game has taught me that my friends really hate me. 10/10 would continue playing.
Kona	Recommended	64.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/famikona/	Easilly the best of the 3 Party Packs.
Killemnow	Recommended	20.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/killemnow/	Trivia Murder Party is super fun.
Oh, youre with her now?	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mynamajeffSPB/	The game is really fun, however the tee shirt game is a little laggy regarding jackbox.tv and will count down even when the prompt hasnt come up. Fix this, and its the best game ever.
Joshimuz	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Joshimuz/	Unlike the previous two installments, I found EVERY game in this pack great!

Everyone seems to be on their phone?Jackbox is the answer.Lots of variety in the games, with Trivia Murder Party, Quiplash 2 and the all new and very entertaining Fakin' It being personal favourites. Lots of laughs to be had and with plenty of opportunities for in house jokes to keep everyone guessing!I even had a brother of mine play on his phone during a toilet "stop" and win... NOTICE: Make sure you have phone chargers handy as you'll most likely be playing this at night time and everyone's phone will be low on battery!If you're a fan of the series, it's a must buy - the game is becoming a lot more polished with plenty more options for each individual game.  If you haven't played Jackbox before, check out Jackbox Party Pack 1 & 2 as well.
TheRaven81	Recommended	3.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRaven81/	Pretty good collection.  Nice bonus with Tee-KO, being able to buy the shirts afterwards.
Nick	Recommended	33.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NicksHardware/	Amazing, nothing else to say. Worth every penny.
A Certain Goose	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Goose907g/	Fun game to play on stream. Keeps the streamer talking and entertaining the viewers. 10/10 game to play on stream.
thetadeltatau	Recommended	219.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198042113597/	Are you a streamer? Get this game. So much fun, so useful for a streamer. Basically, gives a variety of party games you can easily integrate with streaming and play with your viewers. A lot of fun, a lot of replay-ability. Just be sure to require Twitch log ins when you play, there are many trolls on Twitch who WILL ruin your games.
NinMaster712	Recommended	58.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NinMaster712/	Blah blah blah, you all know the drill.QUIPLASH 2: I LOVED Quiplash XL, and I love this game just as much. The new Quipsters are the best, especially Teal, the new prompts are hilarious, and the Last Lash... Oh my GOD, the Last Lash. They changed it so that, instead of generating a random prompt, they bring up a word for you to put into a situation (Word Lash!), an acronym that needs an extended version (Acro Lash!), or a one-panel comic that needs to be completed (Comic Lash!). I really enjoy the changes made, and I believe that this is one of the two selling points of this package. (Also the "Make Your Own Prompt" feature seems awesome, but I haven't tried it yet.)TRIVIA MURDER PARTY: Everyone's favorite. It's not mine, Quiplash 2 is, but this definitely gets the silver medal. The whole concept of a murderer hosting a trivia party and killing all but one player just makes me smile. The questions are good, the Killing Floor segments are cool (except for the freaking fingers one, GOD), the demented music is a nice touch, and the whole voodoo doll representation is amazing. By the way, does anyone else think the red one is flipping people off instead of whatever it is he is ACTUALLY doing? Anyway, this is a clever trivia game that should NOT go unnoticed.GUESSPIONAGE: I'll admit it... I don't like this one. When I first experienced a little bit of it, it seemed interesting, a percentage-guessing game with cool player avatars, but I later found out that not only does it seem like it takes forever, the concept got grating REALLY FAST. All of the questions are bizarre and I had a flat 0 for the entire first half of the only full game I played. If you like statistics, I would recommend this game, but it's probably even too boring for those kinds of people.FAKIN' IT!: I originally disliked this game, but that's because the first time I played it, everyone had confusing names and was scattered across the room, so we had to end it early. Playing it twice more, though, made me grow to like this game. I like the stereotypical 60s commercial feel to the game's art style and the music is a nice touch, too. I also like how helpless the liar can be, like during Number Pressure, when I held up 2 fingers when the prompt was "Number of social media apps", so I felt really tense for GOOD REASON. My only recommendation is that you play with the maximum amount of players (6) for a challenge and, as the game suggests, sit in rows or a semi-circle around the screen. Otherwise, You Gotta Point and Face Value will be IMPOSSIBLE. Otherwise, great game!TEE K.O.: I really like the art style for this one, as well as the yokai characters from Japanese mythology (I'm a fan of Yo-Kai Watch, don't judge me). The concept is nice, too, Quiplash with t-shirts. However, the game takes FOREVER. Two or three rounds of Quiplash 2, depending on the number of players, can be completed in the same amount of time as one round of Tee K.O., or, at least, that's what it seems like. At least one or two plays should be guaranteed, but if you like quick games like me, then this probably isn't the one for you.To conclude, this wasn't better than the 2nd Pack, but half of the games ARE worth your time.GAMES RANKED FROM WORST TO BEST:GuesspionageTee K.O.Fakin' It!Trivia Murder PartyQuiplash 2

Dead Man	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DeadManOz/	2 of the games in this are quite amazing and beautifully done, enjoy them as they will keep you amused. Throw a party, or just a few friends over. This is continuing on this awesome series of works, they'll always stuff up with some, and the t shirt one is just as bad as it sounds.Trivia Murder Party though....my god i can't stop playing.... Send Help
MothWhisperer	Recommended	19.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mothwhisperer/	Real good party-game fun, as with the last few installments, but with some new and unique games to try, as well as the welcome return of updated classics. I've found Pack 3 to be a staple for bringing along to bigger social groups at university, with many games that are much more fun with more players. Unlike, for example, Drawful, however, I find these games rely on these larger numbers to be fun, and this pack makes it out less when I play with only two or  three other people.Overall, very worth buying, this pack expands my party-game library, working well in conjunction with the other installments as the new games are not to some people's taste (I seem to find people who swear by Quiplash are less into TKO, and vice versa), but ensure there is something for everyone to enjoy.
PBK	Recommended	34.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198339867589/	jesus christ, i have had way more fun with this with my friends than i would've ever thought. It has some really good modes and with the right friends you can always find times to enjoy them. 8/10
Xanderg	Recommended	35.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AngelDragon/	Jackbox is back at it again with a new party pack, and they sure delivered!Quiplash 2 is still very much the same, great game but with the ability to create custom games, and a final round that I consider to be much, much more improved!Trivia Murder Party includes usage of brain power in a dark setting with fun little mini-games and an intense final round (provided everyone doesn't die)Guesspionage is an all round, fun game to play, even if there's the chance that the percentage answers might not be fully accurate, you can never go wrong with a such a guessing game!I enjoy Fakin' It! but unfortunately, not a lot of the people I've played it with do, not to mention the fact that it'd be really tough to play it online. It demands a certain level of involvement that might not really come across as fun for a majority of people.Tee K.O. is definitely my favourite out of the bunch, it's the one game where I don't feel winning is as much of a necessity, it's more of a game that allows you to express your creativity and make the most hilarious shirts you and your friends can think of!I certainly recommend getting this one, it's the best one yet in my opinion. I find playing this game to be most effective on a decent laptop (or your desktop if it's within range) connected to a TV via HDMI.
Bushpig	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027865028/	Great party games

vickitakethat	Recommended	73.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/vickitakethat/	Many hours playing on Twitch and with friends. Only good if you have 3+ others to play with, but only one of you needs to purchase the game.
SMILINGFURY	Recommended	8.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jacobbiley/	This is my favorite Jack box pack. T. Shirt k.o. is one of the best games jack box has ever invented. Drawing t shirt designs, and then coming up with captions is great way to spend a Friday night with friends. If you love hanging out with Friday and goofing around this is the game for you.
ult.wingman	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wingmanmo2/	Probably their strongest pack yet.
.Lack | Toasted Nipple Crunch	Recommended	25.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zieel/	The quality has risen in every aspect since the last pack and we were given 4 new games and a revamp of quiplash,if you played any of the previous packs you know what to expect, but in short get your friends and play any of these for any occasion to guarantee some fun times.friends willing to play with you after they got their christmas gifts of the new AAA titles not included 
Cuddlefluff	Recommended	4.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuddlefluff/	Best party game(s) ever. The reviews should say overwhelmingly positive because I can't fathom how anyone could not like this - unless they have boring friends or are playing with their moms or something. I don't know.I remember playing all those dumbass ♥♥♥♥♥♥ craptastic fad games on PS2 were you pressed some big red button or someting (I don't know I was drunk) but this game is nothing like that because this game doesn't guarantee that the person who happen to own the game is always going to win every round. Which is something that I happen to like. A lot.

Laphin Hyena	Recommended	21.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/laphin/	If you stream like me, then this game is amazing.  I dip into this every once and awhile for my livestream and it's generally a great time!  Nice variety of games, even a Halloween/Horror MURDER party which is great for October.If you want to include your stream viewers and have some good fun, this is definitely a title you need in your library!
ZITAPIS	Recommended	4.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198066231005/	Expected nothing less from this game. I never spend a lot of money for games but i go all in for this studio. Definetely reccomended

K177Y	Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/h3110k177y/	Really love this game, unfortunately a lot of it is American trivia so not well suited to UK buyers.
fuzzylumpkinzz	Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ulikebutts/	this game is awesome for groups. the only game i think needs help is the guesspionage one (the spies). it relies on an audience pretty heavily so its great for streamers but not as good for small groups. would highly reccomend this party pack out of the three.
Chavid	Recommended	11.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chavid/	All great games in here, had a lot of fun with Tee K.O. and Fakin' It.
JackDaniels	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SmexyusSandvichiusDispensurus/	Amazing game. Love it play it. Good with family night
RedToad64	Recommended	23.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044024106/	Who's ready for round three of fun party games from Jackbox? Everybody! Well, that is since anyone with a smartphone or internet-connected devices can hop in and play along with these four brand new titles and one upgrade. Trivia Murder Party is answering questions and playing mini-games to stay alive. Tee K.O. has players drawing slogans and wacky pictures to make the ultimate t-shirt (which you can actually buy). Quiplash makes a return with loads of new content... plus more!This is a must purchase if you and friends enjoyed the original two Jackbox Party Packs!
<|NAB|> XcelentTom	Recommended	30.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xcelenttom/	The most fun you can have with your clothes on involving more than 4 persons. An absolute must have for every LAN-party or other party for that matter. Just so easy to play along using your own devices.Small sidenote: Quite annoying that America still uses the Imperial system, come on guys! The whole world uses the metric scale!
ToxicNikki	Recommended	31.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ToxicNikki/	Love this party pack. My parents and I play Trivia Murder Party frequently. We would play it more, but the game takes a while to open and is super laggy. I know a lot of that has to do with my computer, but a lot of that is TMP itself. It's the only game that seems to have this problem.I also wish we could shut off memory mini games (like the blood splatter and patterns) like we can the writing and drawing games. Nobody I play with find those mini games enjoyable and they ALWAYS come up when we play.

PlayXoto	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/playxoto/	If you haven't bought JBPP3 yet, you need to buy it now!I had a blast with my friends and I'm looking forward to play it again, and again!All 5 games are awesome in my opinion, but if you want a top 5 here it is:5 - QuipLash 24 - Guesspionage3 - Trivia Murder Party2 - Fakin' it1 - Tee K.O.But don't get me wrong! All 5 games are excellent and fun to play, so this Top 5 is quite pointless...I won't say "buy this only if you have friends" because it's unnecessary. This kind of games are designed with the objective of being played with friends and/or family. Now to the company that made this game: Thank you for making these games! They're amazing and you're amazing! I'm definitely buying JBPP4! (btw, Fibbage Enough About You and Survive The Internet are pretty cool! Nice work!)
DINKLEBURG	Recommended	73.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tlippinc2400/	This is the go to game for me and my buddies at home. Easily put in 100+ games in quiplash 2, which allows you to create your own prompts. Who you play this game with really is what makes it though, so I would not reccomend it to anyone who can't get a group of atleast 4 people who are not afraid to get creative.Quiplash 2 is phenomenal and the make your own feature and audience feature are great.Faker is great for less people and really an interesting gameTrivia Murder Party can be a bit strange but its also a lot of funGuesspionage is a little more bland but still some funT shirt KO, I havn't really gotten behind it but it is still an interesting concept.
Mr Midnight	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198161710889/	I really like how you only need to buy it once and connect by other devices and use the website.
Gage	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/GageArchangel/	Fantastically high quality title with games that are better than the last pack. It has been improved on in every way - just wish there was a better way to stream to friends not in the same location, as Steam's streaming is a few seconds behind which can mess up the timers for getting answers in. Other than that, 20 out of 6 points for the shire.
Bat Yes Banana	Recommended	46.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cowe192/	love the jackbox  games this is no different:quiplash 2 is really awesome, not many huge changes from the previous one. the biggest change(aside from the custom prompts) is the ending which is scored a little differently, but all in all, it's an improvement on the previous. not revolutionary or a super huge change, but that wasn't really necessary in the first place 5/5teeKO is pretty fun, but can get somewhat overwhelming with it's extreme open-endedness; you basically draw some pictures then write some phrases, and then you're given a bunch of phrases and pictures to match together to create a funny/cool t-shirt. there are some really hilarious moments, but there's a lot of downtime(it takes 5 minutes to draw all of the pictures) and the funniest jokes are shown a lot so it can get boring by the end, but it's still fun, and you can buy the shirts you made for $16 afterwards 4/5fakin it is the one i didn't expect to be as good, it's basically like werewolf except with truth or dare, one player basically has to answer a personal question although they don't know what the question is, then has to lie about why they answered that way. funniest moments include explaining why i thought there were eight seasons of the walking dead and why i thought i looked the most like tom cruise 5/5guesspionage is like family feud except you're guessing, it's not really fun and only sorta interesting, pass 2/5trivia murder party is freakin great, it's basically you don't know jack but you die if you get a question wrong. usually this brings out the worst in people, since the questions are hard, generally you're going to be guessing, and the minigames usually have fatal consequences to losing. anyone not on the chopping block begins chanting for the survivors to be killed, so "death! death! death!" ends up getting chanted unironically 5/5 would die again
PlayXoto	Recommended	18.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/playxoto/	If you haven't bought JBPP3 yet, you need to buy it now!I had a blast with my friends and I'm looking forward to play it again, and again!All 5 games are awesome in my opinion, but if you want a top 5 here it is:5 - QuipLash 24 - Guesspionage3 - Trivia Murder Party2 - Fakin' it1 - Tee K.O.But don't get me wrong!

varos1wr	Recommended	91.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080563848/	Tons of fun and never gets old. You'll need at least a few friends in order to play most of the games, but it is totally worth it. All the games our good. Quiplash delivers the biggest laughs, while guesspionage felt like the game with the least amount of content. Trivia Murder Party was extremely well written, but I wish there was more variety in the final portion. Get it! You'll have fun.
Pinto 田舎道	Recommended	29.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pinto_/	Very nice. Buy.
Franswahx	Recommended	53.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/franswah/	I think this is the best set of games in the series yet. Every game, except maybe for Guesspionage, has some twist that makes the game more about having fun rather than simply trying to win. I have never had more fun with a trivia game than with Murder Trivia Party. Tee K.O. takes some setup but is the one that got the most laughs due to the freedom of drawing and writing anything to get the goofiest combinations. Fakin' It is almost impossible for the faker in many cases, but is still hilarious when the accusations start flying and people try to defend themselves in their answers. And Quiplash has always been great with the added bonus of custom games. A step in the right direction for sure.
Frookie	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frookichu/	Really fun party game to play!  Many different types of games where my friends and I have a good laugh and it doesn't feel like one person is always winning.

(Section 8) Yarvin	Recommended	0.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198108933919/	Great game for when friends are over. So many good times and laughs. Highly recommend for people that like having fun with friends and family. Just make sure everyone has a smartphone, tablet or Laptop.

olilan	Recommended	49.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/olilan/	Simply the best party games in any form. Jackbox have outdone themselves with this one.
TTV/Salt_Slinger	Recommended	107.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198347344338/	Really fun to play with friends, Quiplash is the best game in the pack.
Max	Recommended	3.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/maxman321/	Best party box to buy ( out of 4 available ones)! It's a blast!
Apooss	Not Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039284398/	Fun games and easy to play with your friends, no need for controllers and so, everyone gets his phone out and you're off.The game would really benefit from a "meet strangers" function where you can play online with other people who do not have a house full of friends to play with.I found Jackbox pack 2 better though, box 3's games are slower pace and the humour does not touch me as much.But my biggest criticism of the game is that it is just too american: way too many questions that only people in the US will know but no "rest of the world" questions. So you end up guesswering about supermarket chains you never heard of, baseball players and other purely USA specific questions. The worst is with the game Guespionage where you have to guess the proportion of people who answered this or that. Clearly the data collection was limited to north america because the results are mind blowing and against common sense too many time if you put it in an european or asian context, that kind of kills the interest of the game.Again, Jackbox 2 had games that were a lot more open to other cultures so if you have to choose between any pack, choose Box 2 (box 4 is not available yet at the time of writing this review).
Freddie	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198399026876/	The best party pack, Trivia Murder Party is awesome and Quiplash is good as always

MikeyMac	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055533621/	This game is out to Make Drinking Games Great Again, and oh boy, it sure did.I have frequently woke up the morning after checking my emails and noticing i bought 3 tshirts with male genitalia on them. 10/10 worth it.
Jannu	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017881252/	Gaem was pretty funny on EU servers. My mates were pretty bad because of they only wrote anal.

Rob-bot	Recommended	12.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarthRobby/	Party Pack 3 has some real hit or miss titles. Quiplash, as always, is good. Trivia Murder Party is perhaps my favorite Jackbox game out there. The rest are mediocore at best, the game "Guesspionage" being absolute trash. "Fakin it" can really only be played with aquantainces. When I played it with my family, it was super easy to guess the faker, as we all knew eachother and out lives. For example I knew my sister has a whisk in her car, so when that came up in the last round, I knew she wasn't the faker.Overall I recomend it. If you are only going to buy one party pack, I'd suggest Party Pack 2 over 3.
Dgrayman2013	Recommended	3.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dgrayman2013/	A Fantastic game to play with friends and family!
J_UwU	Recommended	28.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jus_vidya/	Great game! Every game in this instalment is great and none up one another. Would like to see Jackbox update the previous packs to include settings though.
olilan	Recommended	49.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/olilan/	Simply the best party games in any form. Jackbox have outdone themselves with this one.
FrostMist	Recommended	15.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198014935196/	it's good - you should own it! :D
No BALLS!	Recommended	24.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198239670484/	This is the best game I ever played I haven't played the other two games but I think trivia murder party just makes this amazing
sureokay	Recommended	31.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sureokay/	This game is great. This game with a ton of drunk friends is f'in awesome.
Eddie	Recommended	16.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198096293105/	They are all so fun. This is most definitely my favorite game in the series.However, Tee K.O. is very laggy. There should be a setting to reduce the animations or something along those lines.
SFX Acidic	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SFX_Acidic/	Product received for free
Juicy lft	Recommended	28.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/juicyuc/	Couldn't wait on my friends to try out this new pack after playing the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of the other two.Game told me at least 3 times I have no friends.Feelsbadman.EDIT:After playing for real, it's good. Let me start off with Quiplash 2. If you've played the first one: it's basically that, BUT you can also make your own prompts. Which is pretty good. Quiplash is my favourite to play with drunken friends. It's just so much fun.Secondly, Guesspionage. It was ok when playing with my friends. It's basically just a game of higher/lower, nothing else. However, it was such a blast watching a streamer play it. Because then, instead of the normal 'global data', it uses the answer that the stream watchers are giving, which was a lot of fun.Faking it is decent. It probably can be fun, but I've found it to be waay to hard to fake, unless you're lucky with the questions. Another downside is that you can only play it in person.Trivia Murder party is great, it kinda reminds me of You Don't Know Jack, from the first pack. It is witty, with good questions, and the minigames are hilarious. Be prepared to get absolutely ♥♥♥♥ed over though.Finally Tee K.O. Meh. It took really long to play 'a game', and it was just the same thing over and over again. You have to be in a very creative group to make this fun, and you can't be playing to win. This game mode might work as a streamer, because you get the audience votes, but in a group of 5 it was the least liked game mode.So why have I recommended this game? Quiplash just does it for me. It's the ultimate game to play with friends, and will have you crying with laughter. For a little bit more serious and competitive game, there's Trivia Murder Party. However, if you have to choose between Pack 2 and 3, I'd suggest 2. I just got this because 1 & 2 were an absolute blast, and I want to support the developers.
Enchidillo	Recommended	24.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999044401/	In my opinion, the best party pack yet. Every game is very fun and can bring endless hours of entertainment.The only downside is if you have a problem with high-pitched white noise, the game Guesspionage will cause discomfort between every question. Several of my friends can't even play the game because it causes them headaches.Other than that, superb games and lots of fun to be had.
My Little Tony	Recommended	34.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cpttony/	Crashed before final question, would not recommend -3/10
The Scary Cow	Recommended	21.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085185252/	EDIT: The issue is fixed! Yay!10/10 would get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥by a sexy werewolf againMy original review if you wanna read it, i don't know why you would, but here it isFrom what i've played so far, it's a fun game, but my god the frame rate is bad. My PC blows the system requirements out of the water by a mile, so I don't think it's that, I really wanna recommend this game, but I cant because of the frame rate issues. I've reinstalled the game, restarted steam, and restarted my PC. I have no idea what's causing the problem. Any comments would be very helpful, and if I get this problem fixed I will change the rating to a thumbs up (because I love the jackbox games) and write a review more about the games rather than the issues.
Kerli	Recommended	58.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kerli/	I buy these games because they attract people who may one day become friends... Unfortunately, if they play this game with me they instantly dislike me because I am 2 gud. dey git rekt. fkn skrubs.

lockwoodx	Recommended	1.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lockwoodx/	This gets my Mom's Spaghetti award.Friends usually host so It doesn't look like I've got a ton of hours but this one is a real gem for 4+ friends any given night and even better with full patries. People can watch, play free so long as they're a host, pubs are fun and friendly. Great overall product and my favorite pack of the bunch.

This game has caused people to put PSA's out warning people about the addictive tendencies of this game. Buyer beware: you will play it, you will love it, you will make your friends hate you. OMG JACKBOX!!!!!!!!!!!!
Gratz	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/NyneGratz/	what can i say...
Raggot	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197988422693/	Nice party concept. No controllers needed, just a device that can connect to the internet for each player.Worth it because of Quiplash 2. But really worth it because of it alone. Be careful on who you play it with though, because the amount of profanities and political incorrectness this game can pull out of seemingly moderate, quiet people is outstanding. I got laughter cramps multiple times thanks to this game.Out of the other games Tee K.O. can turn out fun although it's a bit slow and not competitive, but the other ones are pretty poorly done. Those based on trivia heavily suffer Americanism (like assuming all players belong to the 5% of world population living in the U.S.) and quite shallow questions (expect more questions about Angelina Jolie than about history or science).Still, really recommended if discounted.

I would have given this game double-thumbs up, but playing it for the first with my kids and seeing questions like "have you gone skinny dipping?" and "have you ever been caught masturbating?"  is not cool.

Spitz	Not Recommended	67.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198000009718/	I had a friend introduce me to this game, and with a large group of people we had an awesome time.I bought the game so I could play with my friends and right away on the word game I was already noticing the same questions coming up.Not too impressed. With the $30 price tag I expect to see a little more effort put into the number of word questions and trivia.Also it feels like the questions were chosen by a 14 year old who had been given a month to find minimum 50 questions, But instead left it for the night of and frantically scrolled through Wikipedia and thought of some off the top of his head, and I say "his" because not many girls care to know which Call of Duty came first.

BugZy	Recommended	5.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BugZyAussieHeroes/	Unless you’ve been living in deepest darkest Peru, you’re probably familiar with “party games”. Over the past few years, the humorous people at Jackbox have been developing a series of party game collections called “Jackbox Party Packs”. I’ve been given the opportunity to review the third one, so let’s get to it! The Jackbox Party Pack 3 – is it worth buying?The full review is too large to put into a Steam user review, so you can view it here. We also have pictures![www.gamesworthbuying.com]

Chocolate Sailor	Not Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ChocolateSailor/	Disclosure: I've played a few games from this installment of Jackbox previously with friends and I bought it so that I could try the other games on my own, so my real play time is a bit longer than what is shown on this account.After having a great time with The Jackbox Party Pack 2, I was very excited to surprise my friends with the third installment and play it together. We booted it up over Stream to try it together and we were all disappointed with what we got. I've decided to include a few thoughts about each game in the pack.Quiplash 2Quiplash is a classic and probably my group's favorite Jackbox game. Quiplash 2 fixes a small problem with Quiplash XL by giving twice as much time to vote on answers, which my group appreciated, but the fun and thought provoking "The Last Lash" questions from before were replaced with un-funny twists, like using a few characters to complete a word or captioning a comic. On their own, these twists could make a decent game, but it doesn't feel like Quiplash and isn't as fun as the normal questions. Overall, I'd put this slightly below XL. It's a good game, but you're better off picking an earlier Jackbox pack if you just want Quiplash.Twivia Murder PartyThis one is my group's second favorite. The trivia part is fine and the punishment minigames are fun, but I really hate the final part of the game: a sort of trivia lightning round where dead players race to take the body of a living player (I know that sounds odd, but there's no quick way to explain it). What seems to happen is that two or more people will answer questions correctly to catch up with the living player to steal their body, but only one of those players gets the body. You could have two, three, or more players answer enough questions correctly to be put into the winning stretch, but ignored anyway. If you answer more questions correctly than a living player as they cross into the safe area, your success is once again ignored. I don't have to win to have fun and I can accept being screwed over by RNG, but it really feels like players are being robbed of deserved victories as the game makes up unspoken rules to keep them from winning at the last second. This game is a decent idea with poor execution. It's almost fun, but isn't.GuesspionageAdmittedly, we spent very little time playing this game. It's very slow and uninteresting. None of us want to play it.Tee K.O.Another game that has a decent idea, but poor execution. I was expecting to use the majority of my phone's screen for drawing freedom, like in Bidiots, but you're given a very small square on your screen to draw in - probably 10-15% of your phone screen, compared to the ~70% screen space box that you're able to draw in for Bidiots. Even if the area has to be a square, the box can be twice as big and still fit on everyone's screen. A long period is spent focusing on making three drawings, another long period is spent making captions to add to the drawings, and then there's more waiting as players are asked to make another drawing and another caption. The drawings each have a 90 second time allotment, meaning you can be waiting as long as four and a half minutes before you move on to the next part, which I think is another 90 seconds. After 6 whopping minutes, the game finally starts and players win by taking credit for others' drawings and captions. All that time spent making good or funny submissions just so another player can use them to win. Terrible design.Fakin’ ItThis is the one game from the pack that I didn't play. The reason being that it's pretty much impossible to play over a stream, which is a shame because I've been told that this is the best game out of the pack. I'm not docking any points for this one, it's my own fault for not getting to play it.

.throzeN!`af	Not Recommended	1.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/throzen/	I'm going to be "that guy" who leaves a rare negative review on an otherwise popular product. And I'm sure the fanboy children of the Jackbox community will automatically down-vote this review without reading or caring. Go on - do it. It's in your blood. It's okay - You don't know any better. ^_^Honestly though, fans of Jackbox 2, hear me out.Jackbox 2, prior to this version, was brilliant - I play it with friends regularly. It's become a tradition when we all get together. My disappointment with this new version stems from the lack of innovation. I'll break it down, game-by-game (the games that reduced my experience, anyway):Trivia Murder Party: When I saw this I was thinking, "aww sweet, some kinda Cluedo-esque game". It wasn't, sadly. What it was, was utter confusion. My friends and I, as bright as we are, couldn't figure out the points system, or why some people were killed off but came back to life, and so on. The game played us, if anything - we just came along for the ride.Guesspionage:  This takes your typical Q&A platform and turns into a betting game of sorts. One player submits an answer in the form of a percentage (e.g. "What percentage of so-and-so love cake?"). The other players try to guess whether you're spot on, or think the real answer is higher or lower. The game, once everybody's has a turn to answer, just... ends... just like that. It was like, "uhh... okay! Moooving on..."Tee K.O: We couldn't wait to try this, and at first it was a blast, combining art skills with lunatic headlines for t-shirt designs. Unlike Guesspionage, this game went on for faaaaar too long, with 6 of us anyway. The worst aspect of the game however is that it isn't the best design that wins, or the best headline, but the best combo of the two, which isn't decided by you. You don't design a t-shirt, team it with an appropriate headline. You mix and match with anonymous submissions from your friends. At the end of the game, one of my friends won the whole contest, because they teamed MY design with MY headline coincidentally, and I got squat. Yeah, no fun.At this point we didn't bother checking out Fakin' It, or the rebooted Quiplash. The game had completely drained us.As I said at the start - we LOVE Jackbox 2, it's fantastic. This latest, hottest version though just lacks logic, sense, true innovation and ultimately fun.Sad panda. :(

helmsdeep88	Not Recommended	3.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198048387441/	Currently, I am quite frustrated with this game. Bought it to have some fun with friends, but the game keeps disconnecting us after the first question. I've contacted support, who hasn't been very responsive. Scoured the support documentation and nothing has worked. As of now, I can not recommend this game as a stable product.

Nezero	Recommended	27.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ne0Art/	I love the jackbox games. When I livestream i enjoy playing any of them with my stream viewers. That bein the case i got this as soon as it came out but it seems my comp is struggling a bit. By no means is it under spec: my comp more than meets the requirements but im wondering if anyone aside from me is having this slow down issue where everything is sort of lagging? For right now the games look promising and everything else is well done if they could make it so the game perhaps runs a little smoother though it would be for the best as of the current moment i give it a 6/10
Björn Nimvik	Not Recommended	5.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198019673652/	Do not buy the partypack. Qiuplash and Fakin' It are the only ones that are fun.

Quickflash90	Not Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263822765/	Only 2/5ths of it is good, and the narrator is annoying as ♥♥♥♥
jackandkarenhopkins	Not Recommended	5.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054480056/	This is one of the worst party games I have ever seen. Personally I feel that local multiplayer party games are wastes of money as you'll probably play them twice a year, but this one is especially poor. The sound the design is absolutley awful. The music and soundeffects are all incredibly annoying, yet can not be turned down as there is only a master volume setting and there are instructions delivered over narration. Finnaly there is the gameplay, all of the games are derivative and only fun a couple of times before getting boring. The prompts and questions are all fairly dull. All and all I think this game is a huge waist of time, and at $25 dollar it is a waist of money as well. 2/10
Kiderra	Recommended	17.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198261475806/	its a mastapiece.0/01/0 if they added donkey from shrek 4: a new dope
AdamOSretro	Not Recommended	14.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/adamosretro/	The games are fun the first few times you play them but then get a bit redundant. The price is WAY too high for just something as basic as trivia and content that YOU have to come up with. I feel like it took them about a day to develope this entire pack of games. If the price was around $10, it would be a perfect buy and totally recomended but at the price now, it's not worth an hour of fun. Let me explain:So the tshirt design game is great but most people arent that creative so it becomes VERY stale after just one play through. The game where you try and figure out who is lying is just WAY too easy to figure it out because the questions they ask are way to specific and the faker always ends up answering something that makes absolutely no sense and BAM, you figure it out. The trivia game is okay but it;s a trivia game and that's all, nothing more so how much fun can it really be? So yeah, you see my point. It's an hour of fun for $25, and most of the games rely on every single person to be totally artistic, outgoing, etc and it just doesn't happen like that in real life. Don't waste your money on it until it gets way cheaper.

malcolmmackay224	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007513026/	 I wasted my money on this game. I wish they had put something in the requirements section indicating that a tablet or phone was required to play the game. There is no mention of that, all I see is:"Play using your phones, tablets, or computers. No extra controllers needed! "The above isn't in the requirements section and regardless, it isn't clear what is needed to play the game.

westcoastsurf	Not Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198012795369/	Controlling Jackbox Party Pack 3 via smartphones is painful. There is a lot of lag from jackbox.tv so you miss questions due to this as your pressed button often does not send data or have you to repeatedly hit the same button just to answer a question. Trying to answer the Memory Block game in Trivia Murder Party's kill room is impossible, the boxes you pick via smartphone never switch to the ON state without pressing them multiple times and even then you are lucky if you get a couple. I have Jackbox party pack 1, it does not suffer from this lag after you've joined the game.The initial jackbox.tv join game page where you enter your room and name seldom works on the first or even fourth try, pressing that PLAY button is painful. You will be frustrated playing this game just by the lagged out web interface on your smartphone.jackbox.tv will not work on Chrome browser and firefox draws a blank plage as well.
Cat	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/cat83/	I am really annoyed by this game it looks great and I thought I could just get it and start playing with people round the world strangers you know multiplayer, meet some new people laugh at new peoples humor NOPE its your friends or nothing, of course people will say will look for room codes online and play that way... I just want to be able to log in start a game and have people join in, I dont want to have to go on a load of forums posting a room code to get people to play with, its a really stupid design flaw and it really means only youtubers are going to get the full benefit of it.
CleanlyBowl	Not Recommended	0.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DrewLeFever/	All games require a lot of people to play them with, like way more than others in previous games. Most games are boring even with friends, compared to Jack Box Party Pack 1 and 2.

cinnamonparadox	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062163616/	I didn't know you couldn't play this game with random people. You either have to be a streamer, be watching one or already have a group of people together. So I'm kinda stuck with something I paid for and have to jump through hoops to play. I wish I knew how to return this so I can get a game that actually lets me play. I'm just not into the though of having to comb through forums and streamers for a chance to possibly play.
ZeVexKryor	Not Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ZeVexKryor/	4/10It is local multiplayer...Wasn't able to play with my friends for that reason, it is essentially like Kahoot.Although it looks fun, if you can work around it. 
|MiC| Mysterious0Bob	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MystBob/	All of the games in this 3rd pack are excellent but Fakin' It is probably the single best party game Jackbox has ever produced. I think a lot of the reviewers on here are playing this online by stream and are missing out. Trust me, if you're all in the room together and know each other well, Fakin' It is on the funniest games you can have at a party. Just be sure you don't get any cheaters making it too obvious that they knew what the question was before it appears on the TV.
radifansgaming	Recommended	73.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198274202082/	This game is very good local multiplayer game, i recommend to play this game when you can gather all your friends in your house, especially Fakin It. Fakin It and Quiplash are the best game in this pack.
ThickDickRick	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Trevo525/	They got more in depth with this game like the mini games have more of a story and explanation for why your answering the questions etc but I like the 2nd one the most it's just fun you don't need to be on a murder game show to have fun I just like lying and seeing if people fall for it (fibbage, Jack Box Party Pack 2)
sn4k3rjaker	Recommended	27.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sn4k3rjaker/	Not every game in this box is an out-and-out winner, but as a whole this is a very strong offering as an easy-to-access party game. Because of this game I bring my laptop to almost every party/social event I participate in, and playing this usually winds up accounting for a huge amount of time investment.specific reviews of the games:Quiplash 2: Easy to pick up, deep, and incredibly fun to play. This is my bread and butter game from this box, and it doesn't get old after a lot of rounds played. My 11 year old cousin was able to keep pace with the rest of my family, but everyone (including one non-native english speaker) felt included and plugged in. 10/10Trivia Murder Party: The idea was great on this game, but every group I've played with has not latched on to it. My friends have tended to get frustrated by the difficulty of the game, and the announcer is very difficult to understand if there's ANY chatter in the room (which is a problem when he's explaining rules). It's a creative twist on standard trivia games, maybe a TMP2 will be better. 5/10Fakin' It: In a decent sized group that knows each other, this is the most fun game of the pack, but it falls short in smaller groups or groups that aren't tight-knit. The interaction outside of phones/internet devices is fun, and leads to a lot of further discussion. If it's not a tight group of friends, the difficulty of knowing/reading each other makes this much less enjoyable. 8/10Tee K.O.: By far the longest and most complex game in the box, but another winner once people are prepared. There's lots of setup before the humor pays off, and I've had a couple groups lose interest in that time, and once interest is lost it's tough to pull it back in. A patient group, however, can result in some seriously funny moments. 7/10Guesspionage: This really feels like a last second throw-in. It's a moderately unique idea that isn't complex or engaging enough to carry more than one round at a time. I guess they can't all be winners.Overall, I believe all the Jackbox Party Packs are worth having, but this is the one I pull out first. Quiplash 2, Tee KO, and Fakin' It are strong enough offerings that nearly any group I've played this with has been engaged in the game right up to the point that phones start dying.Overall: 8/10

How? i use skype. I share my screen and my system sounds lol. but the only game we cant play is fakin' it, which is scrictly physical based. but the creators weren't intending on making online only games, so that is not a drawback. overall, ive had loads of laughs on quiplash, tons of competitiveness on trivia murder party, and relaxation on guesspionage. the games do a really great job setting up their desired atmospheres, and it totally gets you into the game.overall! i am very pleased with my purchase and i believe that it was worth the money.10/10!!!

It really is fun.Tee K.O.:  It's Okay.  It's the second best drawing game out of all the Jackboxes, with Drawful 2 being my favorite drawing game.  I am not much of a drawer though, so keep that in mind.

PixiSquare	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pixisquare/	Best. Investment. Ever. That's pretty much all I have to say. Most of the "let's watch a boring movie" friend hang outs are now bombarded with screams (of stress? of betrayal?). This game can definitely liven up a party that is otherwise dull. I've played 3/5 games from this party pack so far (with parties of 4) and this is my take on the games:Trivia Murder Party - Perfect to play with anyone! You don't really need creative! or witty! friends to make the matches entertaining. Due to the difficulty (but fair) of the trivia questions and the silly comments made by the narrator, also every match has my group at the edge of our seats. Highly recommended to start the pack with this game.Tee K.O - Your friends are♥♥♥♥♥♥at drawing? Their drawings will most likely win the match. The characteristic that really drives this game is a good sense of humor. I found that if you are playing with those who have a similar sense of humor as you or are just funny individuals, you are going to have a blast. A lot of our T-shirt designs have made us laugh so hard our stomachs hurt! Highly recommended for imaginative or self-proclaimed comedians.Quiplash 2 - A bit like Cards Against Humanity but you write your own white cards. This game can get dull if your party doesn't output creative answers, making the game feel more tedious than fun. If you like games where you get to reveal your creative side, give this game a try!Note: If you are looking to play with random players, you can always stream the game on Twitch so people in the chat can join with the room code. It is very easy for players to join the fun!

louisianapurchase	Recommended	3.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiicommie/	Very fun for parties! Bought this for my 16th birthday, and it really brought together people who don't know each other but have the same level of crudeness. I saw some reviews that said Tee K.O. really lacked but it was surprisingly the biggest hit at my party! Unfortunately my grandma and mom walked in on some inappropriate shirt but it really depends on if you're playing with the right people. Trivia Murder Party is better for more vanilla friends, but if you have crude inappropriate fun friends with a favored sense of humor, free fill in and creativity games like Quiplash 2 and Tee K.O. are perfect. I didn't play Guesspionage at my party, mostly because it didn't seem that interesting and its not too much suitable for a party aspect. Overall, love it! Will buy Jackbox Party Pack 4 in the future.
tfw no no	Recommended	12.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/justinheeber/	played quiplash and tee k.o. in front of my crush's parents and now her dad think's im racist gay nazi (i mean my chances were pretty slim anyways but)i still love this pack though. the main attraction is quiplash, but all the other games i've played are still really fun to play (haven't tried guesspionage). definitely worth buying, 8/10.
Panda	Recommended	40.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redpearlpanda/	I could not recomend a better party game for you and your friends. This game is so much better then the first two and in my oppinion better then the 4th. The mix of games is just right where everyone can find one that they like. The trivia one is great for that person you know that likes to share there stores of otherwise useless knowlege. The percent one is great for the person who is great at geussing. The tee shirt game is perfect for the artist in your group. The faker one is good for the one who can figure people out. And my personal favorite Quiplash is amazing and great for the person who can think of witty answers for quirky prompts. Get it or you will regret it.

thealexmott	Recommended	88.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/thealexmott/	Fantastic bunch of hilarious games for parties (or anytime there are 4 or more people in a room). Everyone uses a smartphone or tablet as a controller, so it’s easy to get non-gamers to play! All games support 8 players, except for Fakin’ It which caps it at 6. However, anyone else in the room can join in by being part of the “audience”, who gets to participate in most games by voting for their favorite answers. Quiplash 2: This is one is 100% about being funny. No game has made me laugh more. Laughs: 10/10Competition: 8/10Fakin’ It:   This is the most difficult to grasp in terms of rules. You actually have to point and raise hands and fingers IRL, not just using your phones. However, it’s incredibly clever and a blast to play once everyone catches on.Laughs: 6/10Competition: 9/10Guesspionage:   For fans of Family Feud. You guess what percentage of people gave a specific answer in a survey. Then everyone else says if you were too high or too low. Fun game, but don’t expect frequent chuckles.Laughs: 2/10Competition: 7/10Trivia Murder Party:  This is my all-around favorite. A hilarious, sadistic voice is holding you all hostage and killing you off one by one as you fail at trivia, drawing, dice rolls, anything. It’s like a really dark, actually-enjoyable Mario Party for 8 players.Laughs: 9/10Competition: 10/10Tee K.O.: This is the weak entry. Everyone draws random drawings and writes random phrases. There are no prompts, so this will test everyone’s improv abilities. Then other people make shirts by combining those. So Person A submits a shirt with Person B’s drawing and Person C’s subtitle. It’s an okay premise. But then you vote on which shirts are best. This is where the game really suffers. You can vote for your own shirt if you want (so you probably will). Two shirts go head-to-head and the loser is replaced with a “New Challenger”. This usually leads to the new shirts being picked each time because of the novelty factor. But there is no point system, and those who drew the winning shirt or wrote the winning quote don’t get credited, it’s just the person who slapped two of them together who wins. It was a pretty unfulfilling game.Laughs: 5/10Competition: 0/10TL;DR: Quiplash 2 is a must. Trivia Murder Party is an incredible Mario Party for Adults. Fakin’ It is complex, but worth it. Guesspionage is a thinker’s game. Tee K.O. is very poorly executed. 
Razgreez117	Recommended	47.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Razgreez117/	Awesome and fun game! Everyone I show this game to immediately downloads it for themselves. Easy to play and fun party game for lots of people
tailurr	Recommended	19.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tailurr/	bring this game out for a party and you've instantly become the coolest person in the room.  tee k.o. is the best one in the pack.
Harper357	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Harper357/	Jackbox does it again. This is a pretty good collection of games. The suprising hit is TEE K.O.. It takes away to play the game, and it isn't very funny until the last few minutes of each game, but it really pays off.
freak.	Recommended	29.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Theaveragefreak/	Tons of fun. Every game in this pack is a great time.
FRTZBTH	Recommended	65.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/FRTZBTH/	Great for playing with people who have a sense of humor and phones/tablets. For clarification, since I didn't know this when I got it, in order for everyone to play they open a browser and go to jackbox.tv and enter a roomcode and player name, they don't have to download an app or pay for anything, as long as everyone has a device and an internet connection all is well and it's great fun to play.
Epic Legend	Recommended	22.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198027997643/	Great party game with some friends and alcohol.
Zyan	Recommended	38.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/XyanWasTaken/	Another great game to spend money on for the sole purpose of losing your friends
Г	Recommended	13.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mind_combatant/	5 great games, all great for parties. the more people you have the better.
inventorman101	Recommended	40.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/inventorman101/	Fantastic party game! A great addition the Jackbox Party Pack family. Each game unique and well balanced for all types of players.
MrAgLi	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAgLi/	If you have friends, yes. If not, go cry at a mall, and if someone approach you, tell them to open Jackbox.tv .7/10.
radcats	Recommended	164.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198257218408/	Really fun, Tee K.O. stands out from the crowd, and I feel Quiplash doesn't live up to the hype. Trivia Murder Party is also very good.
Deej	Recommended	21.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198339407633/	Awesome game to play at parties
CrushDani	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CrushDani/	This is basically the best of the 4 Party Packs that are currently out.  Trivia Murder Party is an absolute RIOT even if you have no useless knowledge in your brain (like me).
Chrismus Time	Recommended	12.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/chrismustime/	pros:- extremely fun with buddies- good for 20hrs+- would say all the games in the pack are stellar (except Guessionage which isnt really fun)- capacity for over 8 players via audience function- good party game to stream- good game for non gamers- good game as an icebreaker (i use it at my college dorm whenever the new year comes in)cons:- the time waiting for animations/tutorial/talking takes WAY too long after you've player the game a bit, needs a better skip function- the achievements arent real achievements lol. its a party game- i bought it for 24$verdict:DEFEINITELY a good buy if you live around a solid group of friends (eg. college environment). tons of laughs. just wait for a sale, the game is NOT worth $24 imo. maybe $10 but thats pushing it.
el marko	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/elmarko93/	Excellent party games! So great that everyone can jump in using pretty much any device!Main downfall is that many questions are meant for a US audience. We often all die on these rounds of Trivia Murder Party (UK Players). Pehaps these need to be localised to some extent? Or not punish players so harshly if everyone gets it wrong? I'm hoping there will be a sequel in the future that fixes this!Also I wish Quiplash 2 had some pre-loaded official episodes. It's great that we can find some online but it'd be helpful to also have a load that are just ready to go.
Soft_Sea-boot	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/darkswarm128/	The best of the 3 Jackbox Party packs I own. Multiple hours of party laughs in a collection for you and your friends with smartphones/tablets. It's gross, it's irreverent, and it's hilarious. Murder Trivia Party will occasionally crash, but the fun outweighs occasional technical problems.
Nguyễn Hương Xuân	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BlobbieBlobBlob/	This game is excellent to play with family and friends when you need a laugh! I personally liked all the games, but my friends didn't like "Guesspionage" that much. But we all had a blast playing the other games. I strongly reccomend this game!
Cyardasa	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119535792/	*enters match of Trivia Murder Party**insert The Killing Floor here*Let's play a game.. (Math)*only one person there*you ALL get to play !!!"I'll go easy on you, okay?"*math over*Lets see how well the others did...Achievement Unlock: Murderithmatic!"YOU SAID YOU'D GO EASY ON ME YOU <expletives redacted>"*someone dies*5/6 would play again (the last guy's dead)
KS_SK	Recommended	12.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198215730077/	I was excited to play this game, until I realized I had no friends. So, I played with my family! Well, only grandma, and she doesn't get it. 10/10 would play alone again.
Country Bandicoot	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/countrybandicoot/	Fun game to stream. Fakin it doesn't work on stream. Fakin it is a game that only works if you can see the people in the room.
Shawnc292	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shawnc292/	Really quality worth getting
Colonel Whiplash	Recommended	25.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/colonel_qu/	Debateably the best in the Jackbox series (yes, including jackbox 4). Every game is fun and doesn't get boring unless you play for an entire day.Quiplash 2:This is essentially cards against humanity, except you get to make your own answers. You really can't go wrong with this no matter where, since it can be PG if kids are playing, or AO if adults are playing.Trivia Muder Party:Trivia games are kinda hard to pass up for a party game, this one is a cut above, since you get to play to the very end, with the stakes staying the same or even rising as you go. You don't lose until the very end, and I think that's what makes TMP much better than normal trivia games.Guesspionage:Pretty fun but I admit it's not the best game to transition to. Not much to say but that even though it is one of the lesser games inthe pack, it carries its weight.Tee KO:This game. This game is the best game out of every jackbox pack. If you asked me to buy it for the same price, I'd do it in a heartbeat. If you're unsure of the other games, this game alone is worth the price.Fakin' It:I'd say this is the weakest of the pack. It's kind of lackluster because there are so many ways to cheat that it gets annoying to play.Conclusion:Tee KO and Quiplash 2 alone make this pack worth buying, the others just make it better. If you're unsure with the jackbox series, this pack is the one to get. Tee KO=Quiplash 2> Trivia Murder Party> Guesspionage> Fakin' It
Arrrh	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/argonusb/	A lot of fun for a group of friends.  We have used many nights playing this and other games in the series. A lot of replay value. (Even if you sometimes get the same promt). You kind a need a TV/Big Display connected to a computer or console so everyone can see the screen. And everyone has to have a smartphone/tablet but most people have that i guess.  Well worth the 25$ in my mind.
iScout	Recommended	16.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/13233343/	It's hilarious. It's addictive. It's dirty at times. It's hands down one of the best things you and your friends can do at any gathering.I've played it with my college friends on a near nightly basis at times and we still talk about the jokes and "interesting" responses we got in some of the games. The price tag is a tad high but I'd say that if you're up to playing it often it's worth it. Otherwise definitely grab it on sale.But whatever you do. DO find a way to play this game at some point.
Raquel	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/racquel16/	Awesome fun. Only downside is now I'm always that person who rocks up to a party with a laptop.
Daddy	Recommended	16.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198285199583/	great game if you actually have friends!
Native Wind	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062409105/	This is a necessity anytime we have parties at our house.
Wiznik	Recommended	9.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wiznik/	My friends and I love playing this when we get together. It is pretty damn fun.
RevolverDrummer	Recommended	8.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/brandonbrocius/	Not a bad game in this pack.
Spacebar Jazz	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deachem/	They're all great, but if you get only one Jackbox game, get this one! Play Quiplash with your close friends, and play Trivia Murder Party with everyone else (and also your close friends). Also, Tee KO is secretly a very good co-op game disguised as a competitive one.
MAKO	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbieVampire/	Product received for free
Celestial Fire Flower	Recommended	2.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrinahoyt/	Awesome games! 
TucsonMM	Recommended	21.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkMcCown/	I vote this one to be the overall best out of the 4 Jackbox Party Packs currently available. Good variety. Trivia Murder Party is  usually the favorite when we introduce it to new people.
OpenWorldGamer	Recommended	52.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OpenWorldGamer/	Pretty good game, just gotta be able to get others to play which can be difficult at times.
Tandouze	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rubisnoir/	This game is a must if you want to have fun in a party or waiting for all the people to arrive at the party. With booze or without, it's always fun and hilarious!
Joey	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017595632/	Fun and interactive game that you can play with a group of friends. The game is never the same so everytime you play it will be fun!
Orf BC	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/orfbc/	I nominated this for the Suspension of Disbelief award. It's an incredibly convincing simulation of playing Jackbox.
wryhumor	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263121924/	Really fun and simple to use! I've gotten a lot of use out of it, and will continue to.
o_O	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/o____0/	Quiplash 2 is great with a group of friends. Trivia Murder Party is not bad but Fibbage from the other Jackbox packs is better IMO. Guesspionage seems to be a hit, but some of the stats just can't be right. Probably they used some wacky innaccurate polls for some of the data. They also never explain what is the population that is being looked at, as a lot of the questions deal with things that really vary between groups of people. Fakin' it is pretty good, it's like the game spyfall but with a twist. Tee K.O. has the strangest scoring system, and is pretty random, and alright for those once in a while games to change the flow of things.
dangerjeff	Recommended	16.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dangerjeff/	Every game seems good in this edition, will be playing this at parties for a long time!
joselustrejr2	Recommended	12.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030936433/	Great, creative fun with high replay value!  Makes hosting a party easy!
Stux	Recommended	14.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Stuxkratos/	So, I bought this game today since it was on sale and I am definitely happy with it. I played it with my two high school aged children and my wife. We all enjoyed it and had a blast playing it. Our favorites were the Trivia Murder Mystery and Tee K.O. My kids didn’t like Guesspionage that much but I enjoyed it. This was my first You Don’t Know Jack game and I and please with my experience. We will definitely play these games again. One thing I didn’t understand until after I installed the game was that you use a website on any device to answer the questions or draw. We all used our cell phones (2) Galaxy S6s and (2) iPhones a 5s and a 6. I feel that this game requires a group of people that want to have fun and that are open to trying a new game.
Chubie	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/208737/	An amazing game for parties. Everyone uses their smartphones as controllers, and most of the games support around 8 players. This game will bring many laughs for everyone at the party. Party Pack 3 is the stongest of the Party Packs, but I would also recommend Party Pack 1. Buy this now!
Demfels	Recommended	39.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/demfels/	awesome party game - the feature with people using their mobile phones is awesome.
College of Celiac	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Frednatics/	For the anger of trivia murder party, and the crying caused by laughing so hard at tee-ko, this game is worth it. I haven't played the other games yet, but very much look forward to having friends over to soon. Worth your time if you have 3 or more people!
Creepy Old Man	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198043886129/	This game is really fun with a few people! GET IT and have a laugh.
MrChaos	Recommended	42.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rassydawg/	I highly recommend this game for everyone who has friends with smartphones.
Swarren	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/swarren/	Perfect for Christmas, birthdays, bar mitzvah's, graduations and lunch breaks.
SPaZED	Recommended	26.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/spazed/	I can't remember the last time I laughed as hard as I did when playing Tee K.O. with friends. Having a dark sense of humor helps :-)
Ninki Minjaj	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kathweis95/	Very fun to play with friends, most fun with 5+ players. My favorites are quiplash and trivia murder night!
❥ Aleezilla ✰	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aleezilla/	This game is super fun to play for me and on my stream. Its a great way to interact with viewers and let them join up on the fun. Its super enjoyable (T SHirt one is my favorite). Its cool too since not everybody has to own the game to play.
pietincat	Recommended	11.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pietincat/	I have friends ask me if I can bring this to their party. I know 3 other people who have bought it after playing with me. It's just really freaking fun for anyone.Games in order of best to worst:Quiplash (quickest and most accessible, with tons of funny moments)Tee K.O. (longer, but I've had rounds where people were crying laughing)Murder Trivia (a good crowd pleaser, but doesn't have the intensely funny moments of the others)Fakin' It (more limited in who you can play it with, but has the occasional great moment)Guesspionage (by far the worst, but probably a good choice for complete strangers)
laYs`	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lays/	Get a group of friends/family together and play this game. Make sure you charge your mobile device before hand.
funkyjimmy	Recommended	23.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/funkyjimmy/	Tonnes of fun with a group of friends. I really enjoy the concept of using your phone to interact with a game on a monitor/TV. I cannot wait for Party Pack 4!
Nogujoao	Recommended	20.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nogujoao/	IT SAID PORTUGAL ISN'T A REAL WORD!!!
Sleepy Time Bear	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/benabeljohns/	I much prefer this over Airconsole's offerings. Lots of casual fun to be had with with friends.
Mr. Bulldozer	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mendonky/	This is Worth it for Quiplash alone. I;ve had this out at every house party since getting it and it has been 100% a crowdpleaser and icebreaker. Especially love the ability to make your own prompts to include inside jokes within your group!to be completely honest, the other games have so much potential but miss the mark for a UK audience. Faking it is great but takes a little while to get used to, plus many of the prompts are "all hands down" or "all hands u" type answers which lead to 0 discussion,.Guesspionage and Murder Trivia are great CONCEPTS, but the questions are far too American for a UK audience.TEE KO is FANTASTIC, but strongly reccomend tablets rather than phones.all in all 10/10 still 100% reccomend.
Quipallam	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quipallam/	Super fun game but friends are required
Kålhovedet	Recommended	40.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102285610/	List for this game:1. Mobiles, Tablets or computers ETC.2. Friends:(3. a cp that can run this game. im sure a 4-5 year old pc can run this gamePersonal opinion: This Game is the best Party Game i've ever played i honestly think the mode quiplash better the rest.This game is addictive if you are a group of dirtyminded young people, so i've played this game for 31+ hours totaland i will clearly recommend this game.
Shadow	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198127454950/	hella fun
tailurr	Recommended	19.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tailurr/	bring this game out for a party and you've instantly become the coolest person in the room.  tee k.o. is the best one in the pack.
Harper357	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Harper357/	Jackbox does it again. This is a pretty good collection of games. The suprising hit is TEE K.O.. It takes away to play the game, and it isn't very funny until the last few minutes of each game, but it really pays off.
dimwitf	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dimwitf/	Got my brother-in-law killed 4 times in a row, fending off his attempts to steal my body afterward.  10/10
Murder Takahashi	Recommended	21.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097724200/	STOP READING THIS AND BUY THIS GAME. Youre wasting your time reading this review when you could be playing JPP3!!!
radifansgaming	Recommended	73.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198274202082/	This game is very good local multiplayer game, i recommend to play this game when you can gather all your friends in your house, especially Fakin It. Fakin It and Quiplash are the best game in this pack.
Pearlousytt	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044366511/	Great party game to play with friends!
LydiaBreeze	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/LydiaBreeze/	This game is entirely too much fun to play with friends or family.
Tabsies	Recommended	1.8	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040604849/	Good game.
Linus Anus	Recommended	23.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PotatoPrince69/	Before I bought this game, I had no friendsAfter I bought this game, I apparently have 8 friends that would randomly appear and ask me to play Jackbox Party with me but they never really invite me to other things but then again I have 8 friends now so isn't that amazing for the price of $10?! 10/10, would buy on full price if I'm rich
Yinitzu	Recommended	4.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/improvibatur/	I haven't had the time or interest to try out Trivia Murder Party or Tee K.O. but all the others are great.I totally recommend this pack from all the bundles you can get. At least for me these have offered quite a few hours of fun and all the people who played this (including me) are excited to play these games again.Personal favourites from this pack are Fakin' It and Quiplash. Especially Quiplash, which I consider is the best Jackbox game ever, is loads of fun when played with your friends or family.Fakin' It is great with more players. Personally I'd say have at least 6. We only had 5 and for the Faker it is quite a tough one to avoid the group.
TOM1	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052015356/	Great game, had o lot of fun with friends playing it.Only thing that i disliked is too many american questions in Trivia murder party.There are a lot of questions about american tv shows, NFL, etc.Other games are flawless.
Snow White	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Dankestchick/	If you're tired of losing to your grandfather at Monopoly every family gathering or game night, try putting that♥♥♥♥♥to the test in some of these creative, thought proviking trivia and mystery games. Never thought I'd enjoy seeing my family lose so much. But they'll get.
Superblitty	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superblitty/	Neato game if you have friends that share a sense of humor similar to yours. Make sure you don't regurgitate your organs in laughter when you play this though, because it can get pretty funny.
ThunderBeef	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038411126/	it doesn't suck 'er notin'
Sherlocked	Recommended	31.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198085804346/	Prob the best party pack
The Black Guy	Recommended	12.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/moonlight-maze/	Love it. Great for family/friend gatherings. Narration is a little annoying, but I can't hate them for that.
wryhumor	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263121924/	Really fun and simple to use! I've gotten a lot of use out of it, and will continue to.
Bugpy	Recommended	11.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bugpy/	All of the Jackbox games are amazing. My family love playing Fakin' it, and my friends love the Trivia Murder Party. Of this group, Tee KO is the weakest.
DR. Ferndo Medical Detective	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/9232545/	eaisly the best money i have ever spended on a party game, quipslash 2 its the best game to play with your friends easly we made 8 hours the first time we played it.
RandomDramatics	Recommended	0.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RandomDramatics/	Love the games!
Mr. Bulldozer	Recommended	20.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mendonky/	This is Worth it for Quiplash alone. I;ve had this out at every house party since getting it and it has been 100% a crowdpleaser and icebreaker. Especially love the ability to make your own prompts to include inside jokes within your group!to be completely honest, the other games have so much potential but miss the mark for a UK audience. Faking it is great but takes a little while to get used to, plus many of the prompts are "all hands down" or "all hands u" type answers which lead to 0 discussion,.Guesspionage and Murder Trivia are great CONCEPTS, but the questions are far too American for a UK audience.TEE KO is FANTASTIC, but strongly reccomend tablets rather than phones.all in all 10/10 still 100% reccomend.
Quipallam	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quipallam/	Super fun game but friends are required
Your Mom likes Ranch	Recommended	10.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sirrapesalot/	awesome game for guests
PinkLava101	Recommended	51.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/PinkLava101/	This goes for all of the Jackbox Party Packs; they're absolutely clever and well thought out! Each game has it's own unique twist and each match is different from the rest! Extremely fun to play with friends whether in person or online with screen and audio share! Playing online with Fakin' It is a bit tricky but it's definitely possible. Highly recommended. Can't wait for the 4th pack coming this fall!
Mighty Slagathor	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011463503/	:)
Hai big Virgin	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198369741135/	The worst thing to say, after having sex in a barn - "The cow was better"
Spacebar Jazz	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deachem/	They're all great, but if you get only one Jackbox game, get this one! Play Quiplash with your close friends, and play Trivia Murder Party with everyone else (and also your close friends). Also, Tee KO is secretly a very good co-op game disguised as a competitive one.
Superblitty	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superblitty/	Neato game if you have friends that share a sense of humor similar to yours. Make sure you don't regurgitate your organs in laughter when you play this though, because it can get pretty funny.
OpenWorldGamer	Recommended	52.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/OpenWorldGamer/	Pretty good game, just gotta be able to get others to play which can be difficult at times.

Di Bello	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dibello/	Pretty fun. I prefer it over the fourth one.
about 47 t-rexes	Recommended	62.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/notmark98/	Super fun with some buddies.
Country Bandicoot	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/countrybandicoot/	Fun game to stream. Fakin it doesn't work on stream. Fakin it is a game that only works if you can see the people in the room.
Shawnc292	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shawnc292/	Really quality worth getting
Colonel Whiplash	Recommended	25.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/colonel_qu/	Debateably the best in the Jackbox series (yes, including jackbox 4). Every game is fun and doesn't get boring unless you play for an entire day.Quiplash 2:This is essentially cards against humanity, except you get to make your own answers. You really can't go wrong with this no matter where, since it can be PG if kids are playing, or AO if adults are playing.Trivia Muder Party:Trivia games are kinda hard to pass up for a party game, this one is a cut above, since you get to play to the very end, with the stakes staying the same or even rising as you go. You don't lose until the very end, and I think that's what makes TMP much better than normal trivia games.Guesspionage:Pretty fun but I admit it's not the best game to transition to. Not much to say but that even though it is one of the lesser games inthe pack, it carries its weight.Tee KO:This game. This game is the best game out of every jackbox pack. If you asked me to buy it for the same price, I'd do it in a heartbeat. If you're unsure of the other games, this game alone is worth the price.Fakin' It:I'd say this is the weakest of the pack. It's kind of lackluster because there are so many ways to cheat that it gets annoying to play.Conclusion:Tee KO and Quiplash 2 alone make this pack worth buying, the others just make it better. If you're unsure with the jackbox series, this pack is the one to get. Tee KO=Quiplash 2> Trivia Murder Party> Guesspionage> Fakin' It
fastlane250	Recommended	4.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fastlane250/	Trivia Murder Party has been the only time in my life when my pointless knowledge of The Price is Right was of any use.The other games are pretty great too.
TucsonMM	Recommended	21.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkMcCown/	I vote this one to be the overall best out of the 4 Jackbox Party Packs currently available. Good variety. Trivia Murder Party is  usually the favorite when we introduce it to new people.
CJ&MFlemdog	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFlemdog/	Love it. I plan on getting JBPP4!
whitefire351	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198006714488/	Buy this game now! No rely! Why are you reading this? Go play this game!
Wayril	Recommended	6.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/wayril/	Perfect game to play with friends over! With virtual fun on par with Cards Against Humanity, works great even for people who don't like video games.
ThatGuy	Recommended	20.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197964289245/	A new staple everytime we have friends or family over. The T-shirt game is the only one I'm not a huge fan of. Definitely worth the purchase anyways

Solid recommendation for a sale price. Good recommendation otherwise.
gNatFreak	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gNatFreak/	Fun party game. Quiplash 2, Murder Trivia Party, and Tee K.O. have the most replayability. Guesspionage is just really boring, and the questions aren't specific enough (I mean, what is the source for these statistics?). The faking it game is very repetitive in regards to questions/prompts.
BOB SAGET	Recommended	16.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/bigfish21/	The Trivia Murder Party is a great addition to the Jackbox party pack; I love the feel of the game. The more people you have in your party, the better it is; that's really how it is for all of the games. The other games in this pack are also fun to play, but from what I've seen with the people I play with, the games are either hit or miss. We can agree that the Trivia Murder Party game is the highlight of this pack for us. I really enjoyed the previous installments of this series, and this one is another fun party pack. I always look forward to what comes out next.
rummanrulez	Recommended	27.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rummanrulez/	Outrageously fun especially at parties or with friends if you have any. If not, I'm pretty sure they'll release a DLC for it eventually.
Azualend	Recommended	26.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/azualend/	The Jackbox Party Pack 3, and really the whole series, are fantastic games worth hours upon hours of fun. This game is usfuly for getting to know a small group of people to having at a full on party. My personal favorite is the Trivia Murder Party. The sassy host is the best!
Hobbes	Recommended	39.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977664051/	Great group games. A lot of fun!
JonFC_Redleg	Recommended	47.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198145480010/	Lots of fun to play with friends. Most games in the pack have a family friendly filter option making it playable on many levels. Bring your phone, select a funny name and prepare to laugh!Update Nov 2017 Still just as fun and looking forward to Party Pack 4
Braskus Maximus	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rorworr/	Great game for friends
Zatchel	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zatchel/	I tried it with a few friends at a home reunion and had a blast with it.I really recommended for people who are looking for games for5 or more friends to play, questions of some of the games are focused a lot on north american culture but its expected, so some of the questions might rely on luck more than knowledge :PHAd a good amount of laughts and friendly competition, definelty great.
The Fantastic One Eared Gamer	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135662264/	A great game to pull out at parties. Everyone has a phone, games need very little explanation, and all of said games are at the very least mildly entertaining. The best game is Quiplash 2 by far, followed by Trivia Murder Party. The game suffers from having a few games that rely on having a large number of players.
Owlix	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/owlixxxxxx/	so dang fun that I don't even know what to say in the review
DJDWIZARD	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DJDWIZARD/	An amazing, fun game to play with friends. No need for extra controllers.Just plenty of beer and upto 8 friends

PaperJamRachel	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198287120157/	I like forcing people to play these games with me. It's fun.
Slambot6	Recommended	17.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/slambot6/	Great fun with family and friends, strangers and streaming platforms.The performance is questionable, with severe lag and disconnected clients, players from the web pages for participation.

MAKO	Recommended	14.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbieVampire/	Product received for free
Spacebar Jazz	Recommended	19.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/deachem/	They're all great, but if you get only one Jackbox game, get this one! Play Quiplash with your close friends, and play Trivia Murder Party with everyone else (and also your close friends). Also, Tee KO is secretly a very good co-op game disguised as a competitive one.
Celestial Fire Flower	Recommended	2.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/sabrinahoyt/	Awesome games! 
TucsonMM	Recommended	21.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkMcCown/	I vote this one to be the overall best out of the 4 Jackbox Party Packs currently available. Good variety. Trivia Murder Party is  usually the favorite when we introduce it to new people.
Tandouze	Recommended	18.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/rubisnoir/	This game is a must if you want to have fun in a party or waiting for all the people to arrive at the party. With booze or without, it's always fun and hilarious!
Joey	Recommended	17.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198017595632/	Fun and interactive game that you can play with a group of friends. The game is never the same so everytime you play it will be fun!
Orf BC	Recommended	2.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/orfbc/	I nominated this for the Suspension of Disbelief award. It's an incredibly convincing simulation of playing Jackbox.
Superblitty	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superblitty/	Neato game if you have friends that share a sense of humor similar to yours. Make sure you don't regurgitate your organs in laughter when you play this though, because it can get pretty funny.

TeaHero	Recommended	32.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198099826584/	Make sure you have at least 4 poeple to play with and this is a decent way to have a good night. only needing everyone's phone instead of separate controllers for each makes it really nice.

Lamentful	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/firesniper01/	One of the best games to play when you have a bunch of friends over 
Zeighy.Games	Recommended	8.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/zeighy/	Do you like party games?Do you hate your friends?Do you like to make the most inappropriate joke?This game is for you. :)
Laserwulf	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/laserwulf/	The Jackbox Party Packs are all excellent social games, and the third pack is my favorite so far. The first two each have at least one stinker (among my friends, at least), but all of the games in this pack are fun. Tee KO almost requires tablets for the amount of drawing required, and Fakin' It requires different skills than other Jackbox games, but both are great with the right group.
Arrrh	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/argonusb/	A lot of fun for a group of friends.  We have used many nights playing this and other games in the series. A lot of replay value. (Even if you sometimes get the same promt). You kind a need a TV/Big Display connected to a computer or console so everyone can see the screen. And everyone has to have a smartphone/tablet but most people have that i guess.  Well worth the 25$ in my mind.
Meatbag Wammo	Recommended	2.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/meatbagwammo/	I've never had a better time with my friends than when we're playing these games!
Gokko	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/mingusings/	u wanna drink? PLAY DIS GAMEu wanna haNG OUT WITH ur friends? PLAY DIS gamedunno how to speak in a party? PLAY DIS GAME WITH EVERYONE ELSEyea

iScout	Recommended	16.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/13233343/	It's hilarious. It's addictive. It's dirty at times. It's hands down one of the best things you and your friends can do at any gathering.I've played it with my college friends on a near nightly basis at times and we still talk about the jokes and "interesting" responses we got in some of the games. The price tag is a tad high but I'd say that if you're up to playing it often it's worth it. Otherwise definitely grab it on sale.But whatever you do. DO find a way to play this game at some point.
Blillz	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blillz/	Memes! <3
DarkWolf	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_darkwolf/	Created a t-shirt with a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥drawn on it with the caption "Pence's Nightmare". Was able to buy said t-shirt. Now own said t-shirt.
Rice Muncher 吃饭机	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/koutenryu/	Pretty sick game for parties, best one out of 1 ,2 and 3. Havn't tried 4 yet.
Robbed	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbedKS/	Jackbox, Jackbox 2, Drawful 2, Jackbox 3, you cannot go wrong. No phone app required, making it easy to introduce anyone to. Each pack has two or three standout games (conversely they all have one or two you will never go back to). Family filters make this viable for most party situations, however I nominate this game for the "Best Drunken Saturday Night" award.
Tempest	Recommended	4.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986020573/	This is pure genius!!!  I have played Quiplash quite a few times and have never laughed that hard playing a party game.  It can turn into pure adult humor but if you are ok with that then go for it!!!  Other than some people voting on the dumb answers versus the best answer just to throw it off its the perfect game for a group wanting something different and insanely fun to create an awesome party!!!!
Di Bello	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dibello/	Pretty fun. I prefer it over the fourth one.
about 47 t-rexes	Recommended	62.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/notmark98/	Super fun with some buddies.

o_O	Recommended	6.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/o____0/	Quiplash 2 is great with a group of friends. Trivia Murder Party is not bad but Fibbage from the other Jackbox packs is better IMO. Guesspionage seems to be a hit, but some of the stats just can't be right. Probably they used some wacky innaccurate polls for some of the data. They also never explain what is the population that is being looked at, as a lot of the questions deal with things that really vary between groups of people. Fakin' it is pretty good, it's like the game spyfall but with a twist. Tee K.O. has the strangest scoring system, and is pretty random, and alright for those once in a while games to change the flow of things.
	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198038411126/	it doesn't suck 'er notin'

TOM1	Recommended	21.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198052015356/	Great game, had o lot of fun with friends playing it.Only thing that i disliked is too many american questions in Trivia murder party.There are a lot of questions about american tv shows, NFL, etc.Other games are flawless.
TheUndisputedChampionOfTheWorld	Recommended	5.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheUndisputedChampionOfTheWorld/	Best of the bunch. Very smart and witty. Always a good time with more than 6 players.
Ninki Minjaj	Recommended	7.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kathweis95/	Very fun to play with friends, most fun with 5+ players. My favorites are quiplash and trivia murder night!

Coniferous	Recommended	2.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197986363655/	Fun
|MiC| Mysterious0Bob	Recommended	9.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MystBob/	All of the games in this 3rd pack are excellent but Fakin' It is probably the single best party game Jackbox has ever produced. I think a lot of the reviewers on here are playing this online by stream and are missing out. Trust me, if you're all in the room together and know each other well, Fakin' It is on the funniest games you can have at a party. Just be sure you don't get any cheaters making it too obvious that they knew what the question was before it appears on the TV.
Pearlousytt	Recommended	17.7	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044366511/	Great party game to play with friends!
UGLYBOB80	Recommended	11.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/uglybob80/	great game, really needs to be more popular though, perfect for streams on twitch
Blarbo	Recommended	7.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blarbo/	Played when my family came to visit. We all really enjoyed it, even those who do not like video games at all.
Wonno	Recommended	3.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Jongupp/	My favourite games to play when family and friends are over. Great humor in the game itself that makes everyone laugh by just listening to the random comments throughout the game. You easily spend your whole evening playing these games. At least I know my friends and I do.
PrincessInterrupted	Recommended	6.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/skyberry924/	Great game! We pull it out at every family get together cause its easy for everyone to play. I even got my mom to join in!
2xtreme17	Recommended	8.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/2xtreme17/	Easily some of the most fun I've had with my friends in a while. I look forward to enjoying this game for months and months. Maybe even years! :)
The Dirtiest Sanchez	Recommended	16.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/BismoFunyunsIV/	IMO the best of the series.  A must get if you enjoy playing games with your friends and family.
Shot Of B12	Recommended	2.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SPM707/	Bought this for July 4th and I'd say $15 is well worth the 2 hours I used it for so far.
GofriMan	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gofriman/	Best party games ever.
Alphadoriest	Recommended	32.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Alphadoriest/	This is the weekly family routine. We play Trivia Murder Party followed by Guesspionage, Fakin' it, Quiplash 2 and then Tee KO if we really have the time. That's all of them? We play all of the games. They're all equally engaging. I chime with many here, though, when I beg for online play. I used to play the Jackbox android game that was updated daily with Facebook connected online play. I know these geniuses can do it. Maybe it's a choice to keep it local so that the livestreaming culture around it doesn't disintegrate. As it is, I don't consider livestreaming an alternative to online play.
gNatFreak	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gNatFreak/	Fun party game. Quiplash 2, Murder Trivia Party, and Tee K.O. have the most replayability. Guesspionage is just really boring, and the questions aren't specific enough (I mean, what is the source for these statistics?). The faking it game is very repetitive in regards to questions/prompts.
nightslider	Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/nightslider/	Good party game for big crowds. As long everybody has a smart phone(in this day and age, who does?), they can play. This is also the perfect game to broadcast on Youtube or Twitch because you don't have to be in the same room as everybody. The T-Shirt design game in this bundle is worth the price of the game itself. Everything else is just an added bonus.
Phosphenes	Recommended	30.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lukepagca/	WOW, Jackbox never runs out of ideas! even though the games feel familiar, it still feels fresh and new. You even get a bigger and refreshingly new sequel to a popular game! (Quiplash 2). All the other games are sooooooo fun. We even get to play them even though the players are not in the same location! thats how fun it is! amazing! wow! ahhahaa. KEEP IT UP JACKBOX GAMES. BUY THIS PARTY PACK EVERYONE!
HallofJake	Recommended	33.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047849476/	One of the best things to do with friends and family. This game is a blast and the best of the three Jackbox packs yet! I enjoy all five of the included games and honestly, a good group of people will, too. Super fun, and there's that handy family-friendly mode if you're nervous about playing with your mom. Or your pastor. Or the pope. Super easy for anyone to play, functions great (unless your internet is failing, a connection is required to play), and is not only really fun and well designed, but also hilarious and funny at times. Depending on the game and people you play with, of course.
why my pp smol?	Recommended	42.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SAMMAS1234/	more please...
Flower ..!..	Recommended	37.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lazyalia/	I love that only one person needs the game for others to play on their devices (PC or phone web browsers!) I play this game with long distance friends by them watching my broadcast over steam and using a group chat program. It's fun with the right people and just straight up creative friends.Make sure they are aware that broadcast has at least a 10 second delay. Some jackbox games have added timer in settings because of this.
AlvidiaCat	Recommended	6.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198387980239/	This is a lot of fun! I love playing this with my family and friends and we always have a great time. It's a good icebreaker too if you are with people who don't know eachother very well.
Country Bandicoot	Recommended	14.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/countrybandicoot/	Fun game to stream. Fakin it doesn't work on stream. Fakin it is a game that only works if you can see the people in the room.
Shawnc292	Recommended	29.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shawnc292/	Really quality worth getting
Colonel Whiplash	Recommended	25.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/colonel_qu/	Debateably the best in the Jackbox series (yes, including jackbox 4). Every game is fun and doesn't get boring unless you play for an entire day.Quiplash 2:This is essentially cards against humanity, except you get to make your own answers. You really can't go wrong with this no matter where, since it can be PG if kids are playing, or AO if adults are playing.Trivia Muder Party:Trivia games are kinda hard to pass up for a party game, this one is a cut above, since you get to play to the very end, with the stakes staying the same or even rising as you go. You don't lose until the very end, and I think that's what makes TMP much better than normal trivia games.Guesspionage:Pretty fun but I admit it's not the best game to transition to. Not much to say but that even though it is one of the lesser games inthe pack, it carries its weight.Tee KO:This game. This game is the best game out of every jackbox pack. If you asked me to buy it for the same price, I'd do it in a heartbeat. If you're unsure of the other games, this game alone is worth the price.Fakin' It:I'd say this is the weakest of the pack. It's kind of lackluster because there are so many ways to cheat that it gets annoying to play.Conclusion:Tee KO and Quiplash 2 alone make this pack worth buying, the others just make it better. If you're unsure with the jackbox series, this pack is the one to get. Tee KO=Quiplash 2> Trivia Murder Party> Guesspionage> Fakin' It
fastlane250	Recommended	4.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/fastlane250/	Trivia Murder Party has been the only time in my life when my pointless knowledge of The Price is Right was of any use.The other games are pretty great too.
NoSkillWill	Recommended	7.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aethereus/	two outta five ain't bad.
Arkanon	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197965640732/	This is a solid pack with my favourite being Murder Party. Nothing like watching your friends die to only have them to possess your corpse over the finish line.
Rice Muncher 吃饭机	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/koutenryu/	Pretty sick game for parties, best one out of 1 ,2 and 3. Havn't tried 4 yet.
Robbed	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RobbedKS/	Jackbox, Jackbox 2, Drawful 2, Jackbox 3, you cannot go wrong. No phone app required, making it easy to introduce anyone to. Each pack has two or three standout games (conversely they all have one or two you will never go back to). Family filters make this viable for most party situations, however I nominate this game for the "Best Drunken Saturday Night" award.
GabeTheCoolOne	Recommended	90.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gabem221/	This is so fun!
Lamentful	Recommended	10.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/firesniper01/	One of the best games to play when you have a bunch of friends over 
Blillz	Recommended	7.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/blillz/	Memes! <3
DarkWolf	Recommended	4.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_darkwolf/	Created a t-shirt with a bunch of♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥drawn on it with the caption "Pence's Nightmare". Was able to buy said t-shirt. Now own said t-shirt.
Rice Muncher 吃饭机	Recommended	10.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/koutenryu/	Pretty sick game for parties, best one out of 1 ,2 and 3. Havn't tried 4 yet.
Tacoman987³	Recommended	32.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/tacoman987/	My favorite of the Jackbox game packs. The perfect party game
Angel0fRage	Recommended	1.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198124302422/	Perfect party games to play with friends :D
CrazyTaxi	Recommended	13.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197960562228/	Great party game to have.
Galeden	Recommended	9.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SimplyGaleden/	Great party game, just be aware that if you're playing online you won't be able to share sound without using a program and use a program of your choice to share the screen it's playing on, Like Dicord, or if you're desperate Skype.
The Bleaksmith	Recommended	15.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197998240885/	Fun pack of party games that anyone with a phone can play with. Great for family events!
General SOLITUDE	Recommended	8.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/generalsolitude/	Definately one of the strongest of the party packs.Quiplash 2 - It's Quiplast, with more prompts, which is never a bad thing.Trivia Murder Party - The trivia game show with a twist, just becuase you lead going into the final round doesn't mean you will win.Fakin' It - Best to be played on the couch with friends, this all comes down to what you know about your friends and who can lie, cheat and deny the best.Guesspionage - It's Family Feud but it's better when you stream it and get Twitch people to respond to questions.Tee K.O. - The strongest game in the pack, take Drawful and Quiplash and add in a no-holds bar head-to-head competition where you can BUY the shirts at the end.
damntech	Recommended	11.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356427392/	Everyone loves this game. Everyone. If you have 3 or more players.
SCTYA	Recommended	0.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128653114/	Fanatastic games!....For the social. I don't have any friends so I can't really play them, but love the Lets Plays!!!
Wei-N	Recommended	8.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wei-N/	Worthy successor to the Jackbox series.  Fakin' It especially highlights the social aspects of this game.
DrGambit	Recommended	13.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/drgambit/	Incredible game for families and friends!
thephilosophersdream	Recommended	3.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198300244433/	the game is simply amazing! everything you want in a family/ firends game everyone loved it! couldnt stop playing the trivia murder. awesome game! highly recomended!
Heddon2	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Heddon2/	The best Jackbox pack so far. Each game is able to stand on its own, and none feel like filler. Depending on the group all games can and will work.
A Magic hat	Recommended	3.5	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198200283967/	this game is simply amazing.ive played quite alot and so far its amazing and funid reccomend it to anyone
Aldous	Recommended	2.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aeoldus/	Awesome game, if you have friends.
Exeat	Recommended	4.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Exeat212/	I love ever game made by jack box thay make the best party games ever I have such a good time when i play thisthe olny thing I don't like is how servers need to up to play it, so if the servers ever go downyou can't play any of the games in this pack but i am ok with the it is that good
Insane E	Recommended	11.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/insanee13/	Must for a party.  My favs are tee ok and quiplash
Yablko	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/id/yablko/	A good video game.
❥ Aleezilla ✰	Recommended	10.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aleezilla/	This game is super fun to play for me and on my stream. Its a great way to interact with viewers and let them join up on the fun. Its super enjoyable (T SHirt one is my favorite). Its cool too since not everybody has to own the game to play.
gNatFreak	Recommended	28.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gNatFreak/	Fun party game. Quiplash 2, Murder Trivia Party, and Tee K.O. have the most replayability. Guesspionage is just really boring, and the questions aren't specific enough (I mean, what is the source for these statistics?). The faking it game is very repetitive in regards to questions/prompts.
Raz95	Recommended	23.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198029494380/	This is a Party game: it shouldn't be played with less than 4 players.The Jackbox series are the best (multimedia-based) Party games ever and in my eyes this part is the best of the series (contains the best mix of games).All games in this pack support up 8 active players (limitless number of audience participants can partially interact) exept of 'Faking It' which should always be played with the maximum of 6 or at least 5 players to have the most fun.Best played with a bunch of beer and a sixpack of friends ^^PS: don't forget to charge your mobile phone in order to start a Jackbox evening ;D
Adobe	Recommended	52.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/AdobePro/	This one is the BEST Jackbox Party Pack!  Anytime I play Jackbox with family and friends, this Pack ALWAYS gets used.  It's unavoidable.Best to Worst:  3, 2, 4 (only good game is Fibbage 3 and Fibbage 3 About Me), 1Quiplash 2 and Trivia Murder Party:  Amazing games to play with *anyone*Fakin' It:  Fun to play with those who are *close* to you like family and friends.Quesspionage:  A game that I think is a lot of fun and it deserves more praise than I hear people give it.  It really is fun.Tee K.O.:  It's Okay.  It's the second best drawing game out of all the Jackboxes, with Drawful 2 being my favorite drawing game.  I am not much of a drawer though, so keep that in mind.
Queen Maria Theresa	Recommended	20.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198065742351/	It is illuminated, brethren!
Mattcraft900	Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198126707713/	I don't get to use it often (I don't have friends lol), but when I do, it's always a party. 4/5 stars.
™	Recommended	21.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/CarterACabral/	very good. good game. thank you. fug you Steve. like really? come on.
corncake	Recommended	24.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198272325537/	good fun if you have friendsi dont1/10 
Indexsonic	Recommended	26.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044846877/	awesome game, had many hours of fun playing it with friends.
shaken	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shak3n/	Of the four Jackbox Party Packs released, this one has been the best.Jackbox Party Packs are amazing for family get togethers or anytime you want a local multiplayer game for 4+ people. Unlike most other video games, you aren't limited by the number of controllers on hand, a web browser (be it on a phone, tablet, or computer) for each player is all that is needed. Even if you have more players than a game allows, any remaining people can participate as audience members, so for all practical purposes, these are party games where everyone can play no matter how large the party is.They're also a great alternative to board games and card games, as the rules are very simple, and are always explained verbally in-game as you play, so you don't have to explain or consult the rules at all, and setup is much easier than a tabletop game. All of the games are funny in some way.Besides Tee KO, the length of a play session of each game is pretty short, so you can easily play a variety of the games at a single party, and this also makes it easy for people to drop in and drop out as needed. This makes it much more fun and flexible than something like an hours-long game of Monopoly.I recommend almost all of the games in this pack, with the sole exception of Fakin' It, as some of the questions are too personal, especially in a family setting. 
Djcr0w	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Djcrowered/	Better than the other two
TheMagicIsOver	Recommended	2.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheMagicIsOver/	Continues the formula of the previous entries and is still a ton of fun.
GreatBlakes	Recommended	31.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/greatblakes/	Jackbox Party Packs continue to be the best, most hilarious party games I've ever played. Faster to setup than traditional card games, easier to learn than literally any party videogame that exists (especially on PC), and games that continue to make me tear up laughing more than any other type of media (including movies, TV, and videogames).While there will always be ideas for improvement, I can't overstate how good these games are. Jackbox are so far ahead of the competition. I seriously can't even think of who the next best is...I'll continue to buy Jackbox Party Pack games day one as long as they keep making them!
Flublz	Recommended	13.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198119186166/	Call over some cool friends and have an amazing time!
djinzanedude	Recommended	5.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198219167568/	this game is awesome besides waiting for other players to join while streaming i give it a 10/10
Sprite	Recommended	43.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/jtpbryant/	This game is absolutely amazing.
x270MAXx	Recommended	6.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035330692/	This game helped a party go from "meh" to everyone having fun pretty quickly, so I'd say it's pretty successful at what it does
Spindor	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Spindor/	The most fun you can have with friends, booze and mobile phones that doesn't involve a blow-up doll.
Ganfi	Recommended	29.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/ganfi/	This game just blew the mind of the guys I'm playing with. Even better than the Party Pack 2, even without Fibbage. A necessary installment for every party! Don't think about buying it, just buy it instantly! You won't regret it! Unless you don't have any friends....then you'll cry forever.
Mattsfella	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198131714839/	A great bonding experience.
o w o	Recommended	13.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/snareclaw/	After playing the last two party packs I didn't think they could get any better, but this pack definitely proved me wrong. All the games I've played so far are amazing, and I look forward to playing the rest! It also works very well if you have friends far away, as you can all get together online and play. I'd highly recommend any of these if you have several friends who want to play something.
XxLiLaZnBo1pC5xX	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/xxlilaznbo1pc5xx/	A great party game to introduce casual gamers, newcomers, or just plain anyone slightly interested in gaming to since nearly everyone carries a touchscreen device with internet access around these days and there is far less intimidation getting a group together to play Jackbox games compared to explaining button configurations and steep learning curves involved in other types of games. Quiplash can bring some pretty hilarious results due to players' responses and each game is unique due to each individual personality and thought process in providing answers. Trivia Murder Party is my favorite game of the lot and is well suited to a Halloween party; the trivia questions are hard and it's great to have a mode where even players who feel so far behind others in points can still comeback for a clutch win. Guesspionage is an interesting game where you will find out facts that you didn't know due to the fact that a percentage of people who do a specific activity will be higher, lower, significantly higher, significantly lower, or spot on to what you have guessed. Fakin' It is the more involved and active games where it requires you to hold "poker" faces and have timely reactions to ensure you are "fakin" it and blend seamlessly with the group. Tee K.O. lets you express your creative and artistic side by creating pictures and slogans that can go with a t-shirt; some player responses can make for some awesome and comedic results. You can even custom print a t-shirt with the favorite t-shirt design which can make some funny t-shirts you can rock with your fellow friends.
Hang McStockings	Recommended	13.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/lolsorandumb/	Permanently lose your friends simulator
foolmoron	Recommended	9.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/foolmoron/	Basically only got this for Quiplash 2, and it was very worth it. Great new prompts, subtle but important improvements to make the game more fun for the audience and streamers. Custom prompts is HUGE.Murder Mystery Party is really great, definitely the best new game. It's got the humor of YDKJ and Fibbage in the narrator, but it's also way more fun and interactive than those games. The trivia questions are fun and the minigames put players against each other, which is always really fun (e.g. prisoner's dilemma). The final partGuesspionage is really interesting too, but it only works well if you have 10+ audience members. Otherwise the predictions are ruined. You can always just use the global data though.Tee KO is really bad. It could've been great, if they let players draw, and then had other players write captions, and then vote for which combination is the best, kinda like a mix between Quiplash and Drawful. But instead it's like 5 minutes of drawing followed by 5 minutes of nonsense phrases. There are no jokes, things are only funny coincidentally. It just doesn't work.Haven't tried Fakin It yet since you need 6 players in person to play it but I love mafia so it should be good.So, 4/5 games are fun, 2 of which are REALLY good. Definitely the best Jackbox yet!
Renefoetsie	Recommended	18.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/renefoetsie/	Had a group of friends over and got to play this. While I do think The Jackbox Party Pack 2 is better, this one is very fun, especially Quiplash 2, where you get to make your own questions.Recommended for anyone having some friends over and have some silly fun.
n0pe	Recommended	28.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/RetroSA/	Best one yet.  Most jackbox games have one or more "duds", but this one has a full roster of games worth playing.
Fisto The Sexbot	Recommended	120.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/squishydeathclaw/	THE BEST ONE. I always play this at game nights. It's a bit pricey, but that's really no problem for how much fun you can get out of it. Update these games moar!
TrippingMonkey	Recommended	5.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/trippingmonkey13/	Tee K.O. alone is worth the price of admission.
Master_Of_Mischeif	Recommended	125.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Master_Of_Mischeif/	The jackbox party pack 3 is a really  fun and all u need is one person to stream it and everyone can join . my  followers love the pack and never get bored of playing the games. i highly reccomend this pack for streamers your audiance will love the fun and competive games in this pack. The only suggestion i wanna give to  Jackbox is please add a feature where we can pick Certain words to block so rascist trolls cant spoil  the game when streamed on a bigger platform. i know there is a family feature but if we could pick out the words and still keep the game very funny and entertaining for adults.
Super Robot Force!	Recommended	19.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/superrobotforce/	Everyone I've played these games with absolutely love them. Even people who "hate video games" will have a good time.
Malloc()	Recommended	12.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198001684178/	Good fun for small parties
justtoff	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/justtoff/	Such a great set of games!  Jackbox (FMA YDKJ) has been a ton of [irreverent] fun since it debuted in the mid '90s.  If you ever get together with your family or host parties, the Jackbox franchise is sure to make for a good time.  The experience with a multitude of players all joining from their own devices makes it a game literally anyone can enjoy.  The more diverse the crowd, the better!  And although it can be cheeky, its settings can allow for family-friendly play.  Our family favorite is Quiplash 2.
NoirBrand	Recommended	30.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheNameBrand/	Between the first two Jackboxes and this one, I prefer this one the most, and just overall reccomend it.All of the games are pretty fun to play, although most groups I play with aren't really drawn towards guesspionage or faker (2/5 games). But everyone I play with loves T-KO and Quiplash the most. I love that you can also buy T-shirts from the T-KO game, I've done that a few times now. It's genius that people only need their smartphone to play.All in all this is an excellent party game, and over the older Jackboxes this one shines quite brightly.
Gyrosen	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/gyrosen/	The Jackbox series offer some of the most fun on evenings when my friends and I get together.
It'sProbablyVenom	Recommended	6.6	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198296279944/	Product received for free
DoppeyDanger	Recommended	19.5	https://steamcommunity.com/id/DoppeyDanger/	Great game to play with a group of friends!
Spaceman Spiff	Recommended	1.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/SpacemanSpiff14/	Fun
WiccaParker	Recommended	7.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/WiccaParker/	I love the jackbox games. Great for family and friends to get together for a little fun. I bought this pack mainly for Quiplash and Trivia Murder Party which I played before with friends. Neither game disappoints and I also like that both Trivia murder party and the Guesspionage game allows just 2 players for when you want to play a quick game without a lot of players. Although, the minimum amout for the other games is just 3 players and goes up to 8 at a time. Exception: Fakin it I do believe is 3-6 players and not up to 8 players. Jackbox doesn't disappiont with this installment that's for sure.
CocoMonster	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Azuluris/	Great game for groups/parties with 4+ people; gets everyone involved and comes with a few different games.
shaken	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shak3n/	Of the four Jackbox Party Packs released, this one has been the best.Jackbox Party Packs are amazing for family get togethers or anytime you want a local multiplayer game for 4+ people.

dimwitf	Recommended	8.7	https://steamcommunity.com/id/dimwitf/	Got my brother-in-law killed 4 times in a row, fending off his attempts to steal my body afterward.  10/10
Notoriously Polite Anjanath	Recommended	26.9	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198039461806/	These games are amazing for parties. 100% reccomend if your friends are funny.
Mr.EGM	Recommended	0.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/MrEGM/	Jackbox is an amazing game to play with friends and offers a hell of a lot of fun when you are a full squad of eight people! If you got a lot of friends, this is a super game to play together if you want to have a good time! Highly Recommended!
Omelette on the Run	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977792167/	Quiplash and trivia murder party are among my favorites. T shirt one is almost great but drags on too long with the same shirts. Great addition to the series. Worth a buy
Ashleigh	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/turbulentvision/	Love it a lot! Hilarious games, something for everybody! Quiplash has similarities to cards against humanity so if you have friends who keep wanting to play that, they'll love it! My friends personally enjoyed Tee K.O the most.
Dawyt	Recommended	3.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198428348913/	Great casual party game to play when hosting non-gamers!

It really is fun.Tee K.O.:  It's Okay.  It's the second best drawing game out of all the Jackboxes, with Drawful 2 being my favorite drawing game.  I am not much of a drawer though, so keep that in mind.

Indexsonic	Recommended	26.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044846877/	awesome game, had many hours of fun playing it with friends.
shaken	Recommended	11.6	https://steamcommunity.com/id/shak3n/	Of the four Jackbox Party Packs released, this one has been the best.Jackbox Party Packs are amazing for family get togethers or anytime you want a local multiplayer game for 4+ people. Unlike most other video games, you aren't limited by the number of controllers on hand, a web browser (be it on a phone, tablet, or computer) for each player is all that is needed. Even if you have more players than a game allows, any remaining people can participate as audience members, so for all practical purposes, these are party games where everyone can play no matter how large the party is.They're also a great alternative to board games and card games, as the rules are very simple, and are always explained verbally in-game as you play, so you don't have to explain or consult the rules at all, and setup is much easier than a tabletop game. All of the games are funny in some way.Besides Tee KO, the length of a play session of each game is pretty short, so you can easily play a variety of the games at a single party, and this also makes it easy for people to drop in and drop out as needed. This makes it much more fun and flexible than something like an hours-long game of Monopoly.I recommend almost all of the games in this pack, with the sole exception of Fakin' It, as some of the questions are too personal, especially in a family setting.

justtoff	Recommended	7.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/justtoff/	Such a great set of games!  Jackbox (FMA YDKJ) has been a ton of [irreverent] fun since it debuted in the mid '90s.  If you ever get together with your family or host parties, the Jackbox franchise is sure to make for a good time.  The experience with a multitude of players all joining from their own devices makes it a game literally anyone can enjoy.  The more diverse the crowd, the better!  And although it can be cheeky, its settings can allow for family-friendly play.  Our family favorite is Quiplash 2.
louisianapurchase	Recommended	3.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kawaiicommie/	Very fun for parties! Bought this for my 16th birthday, and it really brought together people who don't know each other but have the same level of crudeness. I saw some reviews that said Tee K.O. really lacked but it was surprisingly the biggest hit at my party! Unfortunately my grandma and mom walked in on some inappropriate shirt but it really depends on if you're playing with the right people. Trivia Murder Party is better for more vanilla friends, but if you have crude inappropriate fun friends with a favored sense of humor, free fill in and creativity games like Quiplash 2 and Tee K.O. are perfect. I didn't play Guesspionage at my party, mostly because it didn't seem that interesting and its not too much suitable for a party aspect. Overall, love it! Will buy Jackbox Party Pack 4 in the future.
CocoMonster	Recommended	14.3	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Azuluris/	Great game for groups/parties with 4+ people; gets everyone involved and comes with a few different games.
PixiSquare	Recommended	10.0	https://steamcommunity.com/id/pixisquare/	Best. Investment. Ever. That's pretty much all I have to say. Most of the "let's watch a boring movie" friend hang outs are now bombarded with screams (of stress? of betrayal?). This game can definitely liven up a party that is otherwise dull. I've played 3/5 games from this party pack so far (with parties of 4) and this is my take on the games:Trivia Murder Party - Perfect to play with anyone! You don't really need creative! or witty! friends to make the matches entertaining. Due to the difficulty (but fair) of the trivia questions and the silly comments made by the narrator, also every match has my group at the edge of our seats. Highly recommended to start the pack with this game.Tee K.O - Your friends are♥♥♥♥♥♥at drawing? Their drawings will most likely win the match. The characteristic that really drives this game is a good sense of humor. I found that if you are playing with those who have a similar sense of humor as you or are just funny individuals, you are going to have a blast. A lot of our T-shirt designs have made us laugh so hard our stomachs hurt! Highly recommended for imaginative or self-proclaimed comedians.Quiplash 2 - A bit like Cards Against Humanity but you write your own white cards. This game can get dull if your party doesn't output creative answers, making the game feel more tedious than fun. If you like games where you get to reveal your creative side, give this game a try!Note: If you are looking to play with random players, you can always stream the game on Twitch so people in the chat can join with the room code. It is very easy for players to join the fun!
_Lew	Recommended	6.1	https://steamcommunity.com/id/_Lew/	Really cool party game!!! I love it
Omelette on the Run	Recommended	8.1	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977792167/	Quiplash and trivia murder party are among my favorites. T shirt one is almost great but drags on too long with the same shirts. Great addition to the series. Worth a buy
Backez	Recommended	72.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/backezlt/	This game is absolutely awesome! There's no better game to play for an evening with friends, especially if you don't have too much energy.
wryhumor	Recommended	4.4	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198263121924/	Really fun and simple to use! I've gotten a lot of use out of it, and will continue to.
Googie	Recommended	2.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/maximumgoogie/	Great for parties or streaming! Expect a lot of butt jokes.
K8felge	Recommended	19.4	https://steamcommunity.com/id/kfelge/	make sure you have parties, because the name doesnt lie! this is a party pack, and only one person needs to buy it for all members to play! wowie! isnt that cool!? i guess im just pretty enthusiastic about this game,, i mean this is a really fun game, but fair warning, dont milk it too much as soon as you get it, because you will get bored. and the best way to experience this game, is when you have those rare parties where you can say "hey! i have just the game!".I mainly play with my friends online with this game! How? i use skype. I share my screen and my system sounds lol. but the only game we cant play is fakin' it, which is scrictly physical based. but the creators weren't intending on making online only games, so that is not a drawback. overall, ive had loads of laughs on quiplash, tons of competitiveness on trivia murder party, and relaxation on guesspionage. the games do a really great job setting up their desired atmospheres, and it totally gets you into the game.overall! i am very pleased with my purchase and i believe that it was worth the money.10/10!!!
泰迪	Recommended	6.8	https://steamcommunity.com/id/Teboje/	AWESOME game to play with your friends
segway	Recommended	6.3	https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198105785354/	Super fun game to play with friends and family! Especially love the horror game.
Panda	Recommended	40.2	https://steamcommunity.com/id/redpearlpanda/	I could not recomend a better party game for you and your friends. This game is so much better then the first two and in my oppinion better then the 4th. The mix of games is just right where everyone can find one that they like. The trivia one is great for that person you know that likes to share there stores of otherwise useless knowlege. The percent one is great for the person who is great at geussing. The tee shirt game is perfect for the artist in your group. The faker one is good for the one who can figure people out. And my personal favorite Quiplash is amazing and great for the person who can think of witty answers for quirky prompts. Get it or you will regret it.
